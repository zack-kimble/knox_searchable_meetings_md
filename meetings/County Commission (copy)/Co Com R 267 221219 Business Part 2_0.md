| 0:01:08| Eleven members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=68)|
| 0:01:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=69)|
| 0:01:12| We are in our public forum for open topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=72)|
| 0:01:19| Next up is Keith Britt, followed by Jack Fox, Debbie Stafford, Aniyah Thompson, and Angela Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=79)|
| 0:01:28| Mr. Britt, please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=88)|
| 0:01:31| For the record, you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=91)|
| 0:01:33| Keith Britt, 506 Knowlton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=93)|
| 0:01:36| Concerning the Knox County Sheriff's Office, in the best case scenario, you have a 15-year-old girl that was rude to a few police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=96)|
| 0:01:47| In the worst case scenario, you have an incredibly abusive use of power by an elected official in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=107)|
| 0:02:01| It probably falls somewhere in the middle of those two extremes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=121)|
| 0:02:07| And I can easily see how, as a commission, you may say, well, we're a legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=127)|
| 0:02:13| We don't have any jurisdiction here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=133)|
| 0:02:16| The sheriff is an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=136)|
| 0:02:20| You don't even have line-item veto of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=140)|
| 0:02:22| Unless you want to veto the whole budget, you really can't make any difference here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=142)|
| 0:02:27| But that's not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=147)|
| 0:02:30| You do have power vested in you to subpoena anybody in the state of Tennessee, in particular an elected official.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=150)|
| 0:02:39| If you'll look at Tennessee Code Annotated 5-5-126, the Knox County Charter, Section 2.02H, and the Knox County Code of Ordinances, Section 2-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=159)|
| 0:02:52| That does give you clear and absolute power to pass a resolution to subpoena anybody and any of their materials relevant to discussions on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=172)|
| 0:03:03| So I am asking you to pass a resolution to subpoena the testimony of the following people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| Knox County Sheriff Tom Spangler, Knox County Sheriff's Communications Director Kimberly Glynn, Kimberly Glynn's husband Jerry Glynn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=188)|
| 0:03:17| Knox County Sheriff's Deputy Ed Lynn, Knox County Sheriff's Deputy Massey, Knox County Sheriff's Deputy Jenkins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=197)|
| 0:03:24| Southern Rock Restaurant CEO Doug Blackburn, Area Manager of the McAllister's Deli at 2758 Shawd Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=204)|
| 0:03:31| In addition, I'm asking you to subpoena the following records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| All electronic communications, texts, social media posts, and phone records of the aforementioned people from November 21st through December 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=215)|
| 0:03:44| and video and audio surveillance footage from McAllister's Deli at 2758 Shawd Road on November 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=224)|
| 0:03:54| You vary in your political beliefs, but I strongly, I think you're all convicted in protecting our citizens from the abuse of power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=234)|
| 0:04:06| I think you're also very protective of the government not attacking a small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=246)|
| 0:04:13| There was an active boycott of a small business based on Sheriff's Office social media posts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=253)|
| 0:04:19| A 15-year-old girl lost her job because of a Sheriff's Office media post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=259)|
| 0:04:26| Good luck with this and Godspeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| Jack Fox, please approach the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=272)|
| 0:04:37| State your name and county of residence for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=277)|
| 0:04:39| Up next, Debbie Stafford and Aniyah Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=279)|
| 0:04:43| Jack Fox, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| Good evening, Commissioners and fellow Knoxvillians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| My name is Jack Fox, and I came here tonight to show support for the Robinson and Thompson family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=290)|
| 0:04:56| who have been the target of ridicule and harassment due to the actions of the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=296)|
| 0:05:03| However, I'm speaking on behalf of myself and likely numerous other members of our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| who have had our civil rights violated by KCSO in the fallout of this incident and many previous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=308)|
| 0:05:15| The day after KCSO posted their version of what occurred at McAllister's, I commented on that post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=315)|
| 0:05:22| Like many others, I voiced my skepticism for what KCSO said took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=322)|
| 0:05:27| I cited my decade in customer service where I saw many times a simple misunderstanding was blown out of proportion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=327)|
| 0:05:34| by a customer either due to embarrassment when they realized they were in the wrong or from sheer entitlement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=334)|
| 0:05:41| A few days later, when I went to check the post, I couldn't find the Sheriff's Office Facebook page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=341)|
| 0:05:47| Instead, I got an error, which through my years of using Facebook, I knew meant that KCSO had blocked me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=347)|
| 0:05:54| While people block each other on social media all the time, government officials and agencies cannot do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=354)|
| 0:06:00| In the case of Davidson v. Randall, the Fourth Court of Appeals ruled the comment section of a public official's page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=360)|
| 0:06:08| is considered a public forum. Therefore, critics cannot be blocked due to voicing an opposing view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=368)|
| 0:06:15| There have been other similar cases with public figures removing unflattering comments and blocking critics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=375)|
| 0:06:22| but this case and others come to the same conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| It is a First Amendment violation to remove comments opposing the government official or agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=386)|
| 0:06:32| or block accounts based on the same behavior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| Censoring citizens does not help the Knox County Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| In fact, it drives the wedge between the department and the public they serve deeper and deeper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=399)|
| 0:06:44| These actions also leave KCSO wide open for lawsuits on these civil rights violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=404)|
| 0:06:49| which would be paid for by taxpayers twice, in cash and again in trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| While I am now unblocked, likely only due to a friend of mine who was also blocked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| directly calling and complaining to KCSO, I suspect whoever is in charge of the social media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=419)|
| 0:07:04| is still blocking or still has people blocked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| Perhaps they, and definitely Kimberly Glenn, would benefit from the four-day workshop next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| to be given by the FBI at the KCSO training facility on law enforcement's media and public relations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=432)|
| 0:07:18| They could show you how to be seen as a professional and ethical organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| and enabling the community to perceive their police as a transparent organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=443)|
| 0:07:28| they can depend on and trust, according to the Facebook post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| Currently, none of that applies to the Knox County Sheriff's Office or their public image.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| Stop violating our civil rights in the community and online. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| Debbie Stafford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| Approach the podium, state your name and county of residence, and you'll have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=471)|
| 0:07:55| Debbie Stafford, Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| And I want to take a moment and say if anyone has a child in here, you might want to take them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| because I'm about to say something that's not really appropriate for little ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=482)|
| 0:08:06| I want to thank you all for having me speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| I'm here to talk about the Tennessee theater controversy of Thursday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=489)|
| 0:08:13| But first, I want to say how disappointed I am as a Hallsdale POW member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| that we had no support to expand the board of the Hallsdale POW Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| I'm one of those people responsible for the $67 million debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| So I'm pretty disappointed right now about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=505)|
| 0:08:28| But as to the Tennessee theater, some people here tonight who support the sexualization of children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=508)|
| 0:08:35| will try to say that I'm phobic in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=515)|
| 0:08:38| That's ridiculous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=518)|
| 0:08:39| One of my daughters is named for my cousin who was gay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| I say was because he died of AIDS, so he's no longer with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| Those supporting the sexualization of children will try to carry on about gay or transgender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=526)|
| 0:08:53| That's not why we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=533)|
| 0:08:55| I'm here to talk about child sexual abuse and permitting children into adult drag shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=535)|
| 0:09:00| To put in perspective, if a 10-year-old came to my office as a nurse practitioner and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| So my parents took me to see a man in a thong who was lip-syncing in front of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| Sex in the air, I don't care, I like the smell of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=550)|
| 0:09:13| Whips and chains excite me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| Then the man bent over with his bottom in my face in a thong and told me he just had his anus waxed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| pulled his buttocks apart to show me, then asked me if I wanted to touch it while my parents cheered him on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=561)|
| 0:09:27| Then a few other adults told me of their special sexual encounters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| I would be required to report this as child sexual abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| This exact thing happened to a 10-year-old at the drag show in Texas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=575)|
| 0:09:39| the same group that's going to be at the Tennessee Theater on Thursday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| So I ask each of you, if I'm required to do something about it, why are all of you helpless?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=583)|

| 0:12:12| Before I walked away, I made sure these customers were taken care of by a coworker of mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| to which point they felt like they were being discriminated against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=736)|

| 0:14:05| I'm here as someone who is educated in trauma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| And it's clear that this young woman was not actually facing a trauma response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=848)|
| 0:14:13| and even if she was, that would have made absolute sense medically, scientifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=853)|
| 0:14:18| We have evidence for these kinds of trauma responses considering what she's been through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=858)|
| 0:14:23| So the adults in our community have to do better to consider the consequences of their actions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=863)|
| 0:14:31| especially when vulnerable youth will be negatively affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=871)|
| 0:14:34| Before escalating conflict, making assumptions, taking things personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=874)|
| 0:14:39| and sharing those assumptions on social media, we need to simply ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| In this case, the consequences have been cyberbullying for this young woman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=883)|
| 0:14:48| and she's already been through so much, she does not need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| So I love that her mother has been quoted as saying that she's proud of her daughter for asking for help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| and I think that this is something that we all need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| I work with teens, parents, adults in general, and members of law enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| who do have extremely stressful jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| So instead of taking things personally and acting out of automatic stress responses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| my hope is that as adults we can model more mindful responses and skillful communication| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| for our young people to learn how to resolve conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=912)|

| 0:15:23| but also specifically in regards to racialized trauma with chapters devoted to unique experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| of black people, white people, and law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| We're all under a lot of stress, and I would say that teens, parents, and police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| are some of the most stressed people in our country right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| But if you hold on to all that stress and you do not resolve it in appropriate and healthy ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| you might find yourself reacting and blowing that stress through somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=943)|

| 0:15:55| We have to grow up and take responsibility for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=955)|

| 0:18:11| and every person who participates in that part of the production| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1091)|
| 0:18:15| which renders the production or performance obscene is guilty of the offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1095)|
| 0:18:20| That means you, ma'am, will be guilty because it's your facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1100)|
| 0:18:27| So will the producer. So will the people performing in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| Guess what the penalty is for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| It's a $10,000 fine minimum up to $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| Are you ready to shell out the 50 grand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| Now, let's go to, oh, well, what if it's not the community standards of what's obscene?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1119)|
| 0:18:45| Well, thankfully, the city already decided that for us with an ordinance that they passed a while back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1125)|
| 0:18:53| Let me read for you briefly what the obscenity declaration by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1133)|
| 0:18:59| So they've already said what they think of it, and I've lost it, so I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| They describe the behavior. It's on the books for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| They describe exposing buttocks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| They describe simulated breasts being exposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| Well, one of the performers runs around with boxes with exposed fake breasts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1154)|
| 0:19:20| That violates the obscenity law in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1160)|
| 0:19:26| So the DA has cover, and she has prosecutorial immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| I mean, we just had case law about this before the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1171)|
| 0:19:35| She is safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| She has an ordinance from the city that says this is obscene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| She has a state law that says you don't need that ordinance, but they've already given you cover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| You all can all en masse call the DA and say, get over there and do your job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1185)|
| 0:19:51| You can go in front of the cameras and ask why the DA is not doing her job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1191)|
| 0:19:57| Now, in closing, I just want to remind you, there's also charities that get money from you that give to her facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1197)|
| 0:20:04| Why don't you pull their funds and give it to a proper charity like the one that was here protecting children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1204)|
| 0:20:10| By the way, I brought this to remind you what a spy looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1210)|
| 0:20:15| Grow one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1215)|

| 0:20:34| Yeah, my name is Caitlin Jones, and I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| I just wanted to come here and speak today because I saw the social media post on Facebook originally from the person who posted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1236)|
| 0:20:44| It didn't name anybody. I wasn't even aware of who it was until after other people on social media started commenting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1244)|
| 0:20:51| I don't condone cyberbullying. I don't think that's correct and should happen under any circumstances with anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1251)|
| 0:20:58| I did just want to point out that that is something that she did not post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1258)|
| 0:21:03| We have a serious violent crime problem here in Knoxville right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| And I just want if you decide to move forward with an advisory board to keep that in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| I'm not against, you know, making sure that officers are being held accountable if that is something that needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| I just want to make sure that we're not prohibiting officers from doing their jobs when it's necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1277)|
| 0:21:22| And because of the crime problem we currently have, I just think that's something that should be considered if that's something that's developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1282)|
| 0:21:27| I also wanted to speak on what is happening at the Tennessee theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1287)|
| 0:21:31| I am all for adults doing what adults want to do as long as it's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1291)|
| 0:21:36| This is legal for adults. I understand that you're saying your hands are tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| I just want to, you know, kind of go off what the last person said and at least speak your voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| You do have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| What you guys say and post on social media is very influential amongst a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| We did hear from a charity earlier tonight, and I just want to make sure that kids aren't being exposed to things that shouldn't be exposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1313)|
| 0:22:00| I did see the videos of the show that's happening here on social media from previous events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1320)|
| 0:22:07| And if that's something that's happening, I mean, we don't allow kids in strip clubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1327)|
| 0:22:10| So why would we allow kids to see what's happening at these shows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| And so even if it's not something that you guys can do, I at least urge you to use your voices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| and urge you to be able to speak up for what you believe while other people do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| You know, both people, both sides have their opinions and believe what they want to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| And so I think it's very crucial that the community hears from all of the community members about all issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1354)|

| 0:23:13| I am the chair of Knox for Liberty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| We are a group of Knox County citizens, and we are standing up and taking action for our faith, families, and freedoms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1396)|
| 0:23:25| I'm here tonight because we are very concerned about the all-ages drag shows happening in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1405)|
| 0:23:32| with the most egregious one of these scheduled for Thursday evening at the Tennessee Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1412)|
| 0:23:38| Earlier today, I emailed each and every one of you a link to the video from this particular production company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1418)|
| 0:23:46| from one of their recent shows in Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1426)|
| 0:23:49| Now, I know you've all had a long day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Have any of you had an opportunity to see my email and watch that video?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1431)|
| 0:23:59| Nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| Have any of you seen any of the videos related to this show?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1441)|
| 0:24:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1450)|
| 0:24:11| Well, you reserve your right to respond or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1451)|
| 0:24:15| As this is a national tour, the show is the same from one city to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| So what you saw, if you had a chance to view the video prior to this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| is a preview of what will happen on Thursday night if the show continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1465)|
| 0:24:34| We respectfully request that this commission take this matter very seriously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1474)|
| 0:24:40| give it the attention it deserves, and pass a resolution to deem these shows as obscene| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1480)|
| 0:24:48| and restrict the attendance of anyone who is under the age of 18.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1488)|
| 0:24:55| In addition, we request that any taxpayer funds be withheld from any venue hosting this type of event for any age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1495)|
| 0:25:07| Our request is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1507)|
| 0:25:09| Do everything you can to protect the well-being, both physical and mental, of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1509)|
| 0:25:25| What is happening in these shows is child abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1525)|
| 0:25:32| And for an abused child, what hurts the most is not only the abuse itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1532)|
| 0:25:41| but knowing that there are other adults who are aware of what is happening and do nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1541)|
| 0:25:50| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1550)|

| 0:26:12| I've lived here 53 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| Unlike most of your audience, I am a Knoxville citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1575)|
| 0:26:21| I vote here, I pay taxes here, and I have more of a right than them to say what happens in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1581)|
| 0:26:30| I was raised to believe that all gay people were pedophiles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1590)|
| 0:26:38| and you were only gay if you were raped by another man,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| because gay people can't reproduce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| They have to rape and change people's minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| I'm 53 years old, and I'm still hearing that garbage and lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1608)|
| 0:26:56| I'm sick of hearing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1616)|

| 0:27:14| There are people in this audience who have taken our personal information, put it online, put us in danger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1634)|
| 0:27:21| accused us of horrible, terrible things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| There's a man in this audience who said that all gay people should be lined up facing the wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1644)|
| 0:27:30| so he can shoot us in the head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1650)|
| 0:27:32| Are these people you want to listen to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| We are not sexualizing children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1657)|
| 0:27:40| You will see nothing at a drag show that you won't see on Dancing with the Stars, a child's pageant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1660)|
| 0:27:48| or on any cheerleader at a football game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| Again, we will be respectful of everyone's opinion, whether we agree with it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1674)|

| 0:33:17| Culture is a sponge that soaks up what was acceptable from the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=1997)|

| 0:33:38| Not every cop is a domestic abuser, but when that is a culture that has made its way into police departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2018)|

| 0:33:51| How these institutions are set up to save cops who shouldn't be working with the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| and have attitudes and ideologies that are hateful and bigoted ensures that this cycle continues to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| and create more and more bad apples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| That something that these cycles create could be not believing a group of officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2044)|

| 0:34:51| There's a lot of problems in KPD, but I want you to focus on the culture that creates those problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2091)|
| 0:35:02| The first thing that could be done to do this is to hire more black officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| There were 10 black officers in the KPD 30 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| There are now 19, with one in commanding office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2112)|

| 0:35:35| And the only way to have this not happen is to start with a minority-only recruiting class for the KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2135)|

| 0:39:04| Of course, the idea is not a novel one, and Knoxville City has had an advisory board for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2344)|
| 0:39:12| It's certainly not a panacea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| It's always a work in progress,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| but I think it's very important to open up channels of mutual communication between the law enforcement agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2359)|
| 0:39:29| and the community that could perhaps relieve some of the tensions that we've heard expressed this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2369)|
| 0:39:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| Amanda Meadows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2384)|
| 0:39:48| Carrie Dugan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| Tavis Sisson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| Amanda Meadows with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| I'm here to speak against this family-friendly drag show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| I'm utterly opposed to the impending family-friendly drag show that is scheduled for December 22nd, this Thursday, in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2403)|
| 0:40:10| This show has leaked footages of pornographic and lewd behaviors with children present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| and I'm going to apologize ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| It's uncomfortable for me just to even read what I have to say here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2417)|
| 0:40:22| These pornographic and lewd behaviors with children show a grown man dressed as a woman with fake boobs in a box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2422)|
| 0:40:29| and dancing and shaking them around, and men dancing in thongs uncovered, again, right in front of children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2429)|
| 0:40:35| There's also dances simulating sodomy, engaging with the children and asking if they are confused yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2435)|
| 0:40:42| Does this sound like family-friendly, or does it sound like child abuse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2442)|
| 0:40:47| I'm teetering on child abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| Honestly, I'm like, right, there's no way you can deny it being child abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| This is disgusting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| Would you want your child or grandchildren or any child at that to be exposed to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2453)|
| 0:41:00| I can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2460)|
| 0:41:01| I ask you, I plead with you, if children aren't allowed to watch or participate in pornography,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2461)|
| 0:41:09| then how can children be allowed to watch or participate in this type of a live show?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| Also, if a man or a woman is caught with child porn, they're charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| So how is this any different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| I'm a mother, and I am grossly disturbed by the allowance that pure, innocent children in any fashion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2482)|
| 0:41:30| would be allowed to see what's happening, let alone to be invited to something that's advertised as family-friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2490)|
| 0:41:38| and all of you should be disgusted as well and should do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2498)|
| 0:41:43| I beg you, and I plead with the mayor to do what's right and to shut this down tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2503)|
| 0:41:48| Do what's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2508)|
| 0:41:50| You know she has the power to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2510)|
| 0:41:58| Thank you, Carrie Dugan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2518)|
| 0:42:08| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| My name is Carrie Dugan, and I'm a resident of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| I've been a resident here for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| I'm originally from California, and my stepfather was California Highway Patrol law enforcement for 22 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2535)|
| 0:42:23| He paid the ultimate sacrifice, and he was killed in the line of duty on March 15th of 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2543)|
| 0:42:31| Defending the law is what my family does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| And because I live in Knox County, I've been made aware of two laws, not just the city ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2555)|
| 0:42:40| but the state law that is already on the books that protects children and places of worship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2560)|
| 0:42:49| local residences, and public parks from cabarets and shows that this one is planned for the 22nd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2569)|
| 0:43:00| I also represent the majority of your constituents in Knox County that are believers in the Lord Jesus Christ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2580)|
| 0:43:10| The majority of your constituents honor the Christmas holiday and recognize Christmas as the birth of their Lord and Savior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2590)|
| 0:43:19| Regardless of denomination, there are many believers in this room and in your county that honor that holiday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2599)|
| 0:43:27| The fact that this show is going to be portrayed three days before we are honoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2607)|
| 0:43:33| and celebrating the birth of our Lord and Savior is inappropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| not to mention the fact that the law should speak for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| We do understand that we have spoken to, some of our friends here have spoken to the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2622)|
| 0:43:50| We've spoken to the Knoxville Police, given the opportunity to enforce the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| and the law enforcement has stated back it's an antiquated law and that they choose not to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2636)|
| 0:44:05| Well, the last I checked, the law is the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| And nobody has the right or the opinion to decide what laws get enforced and what laws don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2649)|
| 0:44:17| So we want to stand on that because you have not one, but you have three violations of your city ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2657)|
| 0:44:26| It's within a thousand feet of a place of worship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| It's within residents that live in lofts and the city park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| That should be enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| But you also have a state statute, which has already been stated here, so I won't waste your time with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| But we are pleading with the mayor because she does have the authority to cancel this and suspend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2682)|
| 0:44:50| And we're respectfully asking that she do that to honor the requests of the majority of her constituents in Knoxville, in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2690)|
| 0:45:00| Thank you so much for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| God bless you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| God bless you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2705)|
| 0:45:12| Tavis Sisson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| And I apologize if I said your name incorrectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| And then we will end with Valerie Dubow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| Hi, I'm Tavis Sisson from Rowan County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2721)|
| 0:45:24| Contrary to what somebody else already mentioned, I think I'm actually the first one to speak from out of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2724)|
| 0:45:34| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| I want to speak against what's going on at the Tennessee Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| I think that there are multiple avenues that this could be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2742)|
| 0:45:47| I think many of them have already been stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| There's been stated a city statute, multiple state statutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2750)|
| 0:45:56| So I'm not going to go into that with much detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| But I wanted to point out that I know a lot is being made of it being a drag show and wanting to be acceptance of that type of sexual orientation or whatever that happens to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2758)|
| 0:46:16| But the Tennessee Code actually defines an adult cabaret as someone that features topless dancers, go-go dancers, exotic dancers, strippers, male or female impersonators, or similar entertainers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2776)|
| 0:46:29| Now, at these shows, they are topless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| They are dancing sexually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| They are go-go dancers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| They are dancing exotically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| They are exotic dancers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2799)|
| 0:46:41| They take off their clothes and accept tips directly from the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| They are strippers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| They are female impersonators, and it's kind of similar entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2806)|
| 0:46:51| It checks every single box of what the state of Tennessee defines as an adult cabaret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2811)|
| 0:46:58| There is absolutely zero reason why these statutes cannot be used to shut this down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2818)|
| 0:47:04| Additionally, what nobody else has mentioned this evening is the county of Knox County has an adult and business employee licenses requirement for any adult business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2824)|
| 0:47:20| This is an adult show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| It is defined as adult cabaret.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| It is an adult business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2844)|
| 0:47:27| Every single employed performer at this show should have submitted and been approved their adult business license, their adult employee license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2847)|
| 0:47:38| If they're not an employee and they are an independent contractor, every single one of them needs to qualify, submit an application, and be approved as an adult business in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2858)|
| 0:47:52| And if they have not done so, they cannot perform because it is an adult show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| Clearly, it is an adult show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| There's no way around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| And lastly, one of our first speakers talked about the mandatory reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2883)|
| 0:48:11| In many states, certain professions, doctors, psychiatrists, teachers, all of which have a mandatory reporting requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2891)|
| 0:48:19| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| I'm a dentist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| I'm also – I have a family history of being a teacher, so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| So I understand mandatory reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2906)|
| 0:48:28| In the state of Tennessee, that mandatory reporting on that last line of all these things, neighbors, everything that goes down, it says other persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2908)|
| 0:48:39| Every single person in the state of Tennessee is required under penalty of a Class A misdemeanor to report child abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2919)|
| 0:48:50| So if you allow this, every single person in that theater who witnessed children being exposed to this grinding, these simulated sex acts, the description of sexual encounters, so on and so forth, that is child abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2930)|
| 0:49:06| It is child sexual abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| Every single one of those people is a mandatory reporter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2949)|
| 0:49:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2954)|
| 0:49:15| My time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| Valerie Deboe, and I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| I missed one on my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2961)|
| 0:49:23| We will end with Glenn Stafford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2963)|
| 0:49:37| Hi, I'm Valerie Deboe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| I'm a Knox County resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| I'm going to have a few words with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| That's going to be off the cuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| I wasn't prepared to speak, but I just felt compelled to be a voice for somebody on the other side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2986)|
| 0:49:52| I'm a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, and I was exposed to situations at a young age that I wish that I never was exposed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=2992)|
| 0:50:04| And I'm afraid that this drag queen show that's being advertised as family friendly is very deceiving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3004)|
| 0:50:12| If you go on their Instagram website, you'll be able to see that they have things on there that's appetizing to children, such as a pooh bear, somebody in a pooh bear costume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3012)|
| 0:50:24| And the pooh bear costume is wearing a bikini top, and he pops his breasts out and exposes his bare breasts of this pooh bear and bounces them around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3024)|
| 0:50:37| I can tell you that that is something that, as a young child, you're not going to want to be able to recover from seeing stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3037)|
| 0:50:46| because it does leave you a lifetime full of other harmful situations that will lead you a lifetime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3046)|
| 0:50:53| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| I'm a little bit nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| But it's very frustrating, because if you haven't ever healed from that and you think that it's normal, it does set you on the path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3057)|
| 0:51:06| For more things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3066)|
| 0:51:12| And my mother was not aware of what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| There's a lot of childhood sexual abuse victims parents don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| And you guys all have all these voices of knowing that this is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| And that's the last thing that I want is any more children to have to go through, is sexual abuse and domestic violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3086)|
| 0:51:34| Because if you look through violence of women, it does stem from being exposed to childhood sexual abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3094)|
| 0:51:44| Another thing that I saw on their website was some other childhood character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| I don't even know what it was, but the character stood in front of everybody and unzipped its crotch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| And as it unzipped its crotch, there were things that were falling out of it, and they were all just dancing around like it was no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3115)|
| 0:52:02| And I think as adults, we all should realize that things like this, that normalized sexuality at a young age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3122)|
| 0:52:08| when children are not able to internalize what is being put in front of them, it's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| You guys all have the ability to know that it's wrong, and it's wrong for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| And you're just going to be setting up a generation of normalizing this type of behaviors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3139)|
| 0:52:27| And it's just going to ruin our society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| And it's not about hate. It's about we know in our hearts what's right and what's wrong, and we're just standing against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3150)|
| 0:52:37| If these people who think that it's normal, I feel bad for them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3157)|
| 0:52:42| because maybe they didn't have the adults in their lives to realize that this was wrong for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| And I just pray for all of them that they find the happiness like I've found through Jesus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3167)|
| 0:52:53| And no matter what your religion is, you can't deny that sexuality for a child is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3173)|
| 0:52:59| So that's all I have to say. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| Glenn Stafford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3183)|
| 0:53:21| Please state your name and county of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3201)|
| 0:53:25| And they saved the best for last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3205)|
| 0:53:29| My name is Glenn Stafford, an actual taxpayer for Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| Good evening, commissioners. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to you about an issue that is weighing heavy on my heart and mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3214)|
| 0:53:43| We are hearing about an increasing number of adult cabaret-style events that are being held not only nationally but here locally as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3223)|
| 0:53:52| Lately, there have been drag shows in Nevada, Texas, Utah, Missouri, North Carolina, Neapolis, New York, Maine, California, Pennsylvania, Washington, Vermont, and now Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3232)|
| 0:54:07| These events are allowing all ages to attend. Why are they allowing all ages to attend?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3247)|
| 0:54:13| Why are these events not 18 and above?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| It's not like these toddlers and preteens have an income with which to tip these performers with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3256)|
| 0:54:22| Then, if they have no money, what do these children have that these drag queens want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3262)|
| 0:54:29| We have asked that question and several others to several different people and have received reason after reason why there's nothing they can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3269)|
| 0:54:38| It isn't my job. It's out of my jurisdiction. My hands are tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3278)|
| 0:54:43| I'm tired of hearing about there's nothing we can do. How about instead we talk about what the County Commission can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3283)|
| 0:54:50| You could issue a resolution tonight calling on Visit Knoxville and the Arts Cultural Alliance to limit attendance to 18 and above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3290)|
| 0:54:59| If they do not limit attendance to 18 and above, you will withhold future funding from the Tennessee Theater, which, by the way, received more than $3.5 million in Knox County taxpayer dollars in the 2022 fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3299)|
| 0:55:16| Could you tell these two non-government organizations that refusal to make such a resolution could result in a loss of 100% of their funding from the county budget in future years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3316)|
| 0:55:29| Could each of you make public statements indicating you're disgusted with these events?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3329)|
| 0:55:36| You could call out the board members and the sponsors of the Tennessee Theater to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| You could each show up on Thursday night and stand vigil outside the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3342)|
| 0:55:46| There are lots of things you can do. Please quit telling us what you can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3346)|
| 0:55:51| There are lots of things you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| Additionally, I'd really like to hear the reason behind why no one seconded Commissioner Lee's proposal on the Housdell Powell Board expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3354)|
| 0:56:02| As a taxpaying Housdell Powell subscriber, I'm in favor of expanding that board, and I would really like to know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3362)|
| 0:56:09| May you have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year, and God bless you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| This concludes our public forum for open topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3373)|
| 0:56:26| We will move on to, actually we don't have any ordinances on first reading or second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3386)|
| 0:56:36| Other business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| Discussion item regarding the Junior Commission Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3399)|
| 0:56:45| Commissioners, I wanted to bring this just because I've gotten a few applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3405)|
| 0:56:53| There is a chart that you should have received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| Some of my applications were confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| One person requested my district, however, lives in District 3 but goes to a school in District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| So I just wanted to have you all weigh in on how we can address, get your opinions on how to address this, and I will start with Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3427)|
| 0:57:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| We had a quick discussion about district versus where you go to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3438)|
| 0:57:25| It was my opinion that we ought to essentially say if it is your direct constituent and it is in your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3445)|
| 0:57:33| then that person resides in your district, then that would take precedence no matter where they went to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3453)|
| 0:57:39| Of course, I have one applicant who lives in an entirely different county but goes to school in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3459)|
| 0:57:46| So just to keep it simple, it was my opinion of who is your direct constituent in your particular district as to where they reside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3466)|
| 0:57:55| Because they may go to L&N STEM Academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| They may go to the trade school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| There are a number of different places they can go, even privately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3481)|
| 0:58:04| So that was my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3484)|
| 0:58:06| And then, of course, with the at-large seats, we have people from all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3486)|
| 0:58:13| The deadline is this Friday, so please promote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3493)|
| 0:58:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| And I wanted to ask you, too, about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3497)|
| 0:58:19| In case there is perhaps a district that does not actually receive an applicant, if they attend a school in that district, could they then go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3499)|
| 0:58:30| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3510)|
| 0:58:31| I mean, obviously, this is year one, and we're trying to do our best to engage the next generation of leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3511)|
| 0:58:38| So I think we'll do our best to have everybody have an applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| But if it's not, then we can certainly do our best to make sure that everybody has a representative with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3523)|
| 0:58:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3529)|
| 0:58:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3530)|
| 0:58:51| Is there any more discussion regarding this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| I also wanted to just bring your attention to I will be posting on public forum tomorrow regarding, excuse me, on the commission forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3534)|
| 0:59:04| our legislative priorities for our January 19th legislative breakfast with our state delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3544)|
| 0:59:10| So if you have any of those, feel free to post.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3550)|
| 0:59:16| And like I said, I will put that on there tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3556)|
| 0:59:19| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3559)|
| 0:59:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3562)|
| 0:59:23| For the folks that are still here, I did want to tell you that I appreciate you all coming out here and speaking out against this Tennessee theater drag show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3563)|
| 0:59:36| I think it's perverse, and I'm against this happening in our county, in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3576)|
| 0:59:44| I would support any efforts to defund anything that this body gives any taxpayer dollars to the perversion of our children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3584)|
| 0:59:57| I think it is abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3597)|
| 0:59:59| And I totally agree with everyone who spoke out against this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| I will tell you I've spoke with several people from the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| I've spoken with the sheriff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| I've spoken with the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3609)|
| 1:00:13| I don't think that the commission has any authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| We can't enforce the laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| But I do want to tell you I'm hearing you, and I support what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| And I hope, if I have anything to do with it, we will not fund any taxpayer dollars from Knox County for any of these type shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3623)|
| 1:00:35| I think it's child abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3635)|
| 1:00:40| And I appreciate you all coming out here during the Christmas season to come and speak to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=3640)|

| 1:10:00| He's not been quiet, and I don't think it's fair for him to be called out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4200)|
| 1:10:06| He was on the phone with the executive director with the Tennessee Theater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| three months ago when we found this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| This vendor is under contract with the Tennessee Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| The Tennessee Theater is not putting a show on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| The vendor was asked by the executive director per Mayor Jacobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| to please put an age limit on there, and the vendor refused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4230)|
| 1:10:35| Mayor Jacobs then asked to at least put parental guidance is suggested on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4235)|
| 1:10:41| He came back a few days later, and he agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| That's what Mayor Jacobs had the ability to do, and he did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| So for people to say that he's being quiet, it's not fair to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| and I'm speaking only for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4254)|
| 1:10:57| I don't speak for any other commissioners up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4257)|
| 1:10:59| I'm not being quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4259)|
| 1:11:01| If anybody has called me, if anybody has emailed me, my constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| and even outside of my constituents get a phone call back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| they get an email back, and they get a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| But I needed to get the information because I believe that's what a good representative does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4272)|
| 1:11:17| So the reason that I'm having Mr. Moyers give us this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4277)|
| 1:11:24| is not to kick the can down the road or not do our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| I don't want anybody to think that, and I will speak for everybody on this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| that we don't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| That's not our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| But we have to do with what we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| and so our legislature is the one that is going to be in control of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| Our DA is not law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| She cannot go in and raid someplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| She is by the state statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| The state attorney general has given an opinion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| So I'm not going to get into the legalese.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4321)|
| 1:12:03| That's for Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4323)|
| 1:12:05| But I wanted to be able to say what I needed to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| I want everybody to hear that, and I appreciate you coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| I've been on your side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| I've been the advocate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| It gets frustrating sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| It feels like we spin our wheels, and I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4339)|
| 1:12:21| So I don't ever take for granted anybody coming down here and speaking your mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| You have every right to do that, and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4345)|
| 1:12:27| I do wish everybody a Merry Christmas, a blessed new year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4347)|
| 1:12:30| and hopefully we can all work together for the betterment of our community come next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4350)|
| 1:12:39| Director Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4359)|
| 1:12:43| Well, I have been involved in adult business regulation since probably the late 1980s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| and I can tell you that it is one of the most difficult and frustrating things that you can do from a governmental point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4369)|
| 1:12:56| All of these activities are imbued with First Amendment aspects that make regulation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4376)|
| 1:13:04| and particularly prior restraint, one of the most difficult things you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4384)|
| 1:13:11| In 2004, the city of Knoxville attempted to shut down an adult bookstore that was on Paper Mill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4391)|
| 1:13:19| They lost, and they had to pay a very large amount of attorney's fees in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4399)|
| 1:13:25| On the heels of that, we had another situation arise with the adult superstore on Lovell Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4405)|
| 1:13:34| and a group of homeowners and property owners asked us to do something about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| Having been burned by these kinds of cases many times in the past, I hired a nationally recognized expert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4419)|
| 1:13:45| who specializes exclusively in drafting ordinances of the nature to regulate adult businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4425)|
| 1:13:54| and he drafted the ordinance, and as I knew would happen, we were sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4434)|
| 1:14:00| Four years later, four years of federal litigation that went all the way to the Sixth Circuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4440)|
| 1:14:07| we won that case, and that was just to require adult businesses to not be run by felons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4447)|
| 1:14:14| and to close after midnight and not open on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4454)|
| 1:14:18| It took us four years of litigation to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4458)|
| 1:14:22| You ask what we can do about something that happens in three days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| The answer from the county's point of view is very little, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4467)|
| 1:14:34| I have watched the tapes of this show, and there is no way that I could conceive of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4474)|
| 1:14:42| that somebody could consider this family-friendly entertainment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| but the ability of this county to regulate a one-off show inside the city of Knoxville is nearly nil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4486)|
| 1:15:00| First of all, we have never applied county ordinances inside the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4500)|
| 1:15:05| and there's a real jurisdictional question in there of whether we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| Our ordinances generally apply outside of the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4510)|
| 1:15:16| Our adult business ordinance has never been applied to businesses inside the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| It only applies to those businesses outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| For those businesses that are inside, you must look to the city government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| and whatever rules and laws they have on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| If this performance violates any state laws,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4531)|
| 1:15:35| then the attorney general could certainly look at it and prosecute any violations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4535)|
| 1:15:42| but that can't happen until after the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| The problem with a live performance is while we have seen on the Internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4544)|
| 1:15:49| what has happened at other venues and other places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| until it actually happens here, we don't know what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| We might have a pretty good idea, but we don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| and that's the problem with prior restraint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| We can't shut down something that hasn't happened yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| So the law puts a great number of constraints on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4566)|
| 1:16:13| I have always been sympathetic with the desire to keep these kind of things out of the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4573)|
| 1:16:19| but the law ties our hands in significant and serious ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4579)|
| 1:16:25| Adult business regulation, if it's entered into, has to be done carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| It has to be done thoughtfully, or you will simply get taken to court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| and you will lose, and you will pay attorneys, plaintiff's attorneys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| attorneys for these kinds of businesses, hundreds of thousands of your dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4595)|
| 1:16:40| That's why we don't do these things off the cuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| So I sympathize with everything everybody said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| I've been there. I've been where you've been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4606)|
| 1:16:50| but we are where we are in this society until hearts and minds change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4610)|
| 1:16:59| There just isn't a lot we can do between now and Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4619)|
| 1:17:05| Now, I know there is a bill before the legislature that directly addresses this sort of show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4625)|
| 1:17:12| and if it passes, then there will be something that the district attorney can enforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4632)|
| 1:17:17| that gives us some teeth, but they're just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| I cannot think of anything reasonable we could do that would satisfy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| what the folks who have been here tonight would want us to do between now and Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| I wish there was, but I'm not going to lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| I'm not going to make promises that I can't keep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4655)|
| 1:17:37| and I'm not going to take actions that would cost this county large sums of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4657)|
| 1:17:45| that have no reasonable prospects of success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| So that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4669)|
| 1:17:51| I wish I had a better answer for you, but that's the truth of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4671)|
| 1:17:58| Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4680)|
| 1:18:05| This has been a hard meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4685)|
| 1:18:12| I feel kind of silly even saying that because I chose to seek this job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4692)|
| 1:18:22| and I chose to represent you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4702)|
| 1:18:27| And I've been out there in those red seats for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4707)|
| 1:18:32| and I've stood at that podium and I've expressed my thoughts and my feelings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4712)|
| 1:18:38| and my position on various issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4718)|
| 1:18:42| And so I want to thank you for being here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| and for sharing your views and your perspectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4726)|
| 1:18:58| I really think it's a sad state that we're in, in our society and in culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4738)|
| 1:19:05| that it's very hard to discern right from wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4745)|
| 1:19:11| And some may say I'm a silly girl, but when I'm faced with those situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4751)|
| 1:19:17| I tend to rely on my faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| And so I don't have the answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-221219-business-part-2?start=4762)|
