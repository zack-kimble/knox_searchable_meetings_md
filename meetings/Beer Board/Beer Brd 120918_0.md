| 0:00:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=25)|
| 0:00:26| Do I hear a motion to approve the minutes of the last meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=26)|
| 0:00:29| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=29)|
| 0:00:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=30)|
| 0:00:31| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=31)|
| 0:00:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=32)|
| 0:00:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=33)|
| 0:00:34| Before we begin hearing the applications, I have three announcements based on some action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=34)|
| 0:00:42| that was taken today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=42)|
| 0:00:44| This morning, there were three revocation hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=44)|
| 0:00:47| Three establishments had been cited by KPD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=47)|
| 0:00:50| It was their first citation, and when you receive a citation like that, you're required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=50)|
| 0:00:55| to submit a remedial plan to KPD within 20 days, and there's also a $250 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=55)|
| 0:01:04| Speedy Mart Deli did submit their plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=64)|
| 0:01:06| They paid their fine, so they're good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=66)|
| 0:01:09| The Bliss Entertainment Doing Business's Old City Entertainment Venue didn't respond to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=69)|
| 0:01:14| a letter, and Sergeant Hunter was not able to deliver, and as a result, Hearing Officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=74)|
| 0:01:19| Petty ordered their license be revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=79)|
| 0:01:23| A new occupant of that space will be coming before us later tonight, and the third action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=83)|
| 0:01:30| was Candy's, also known as The Stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| They didn't file a plan within 20 days and didn't pay the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=94)|
| 0:01:38| An employee of that establishment advised the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=98)|
| 0:01:41| The owner was out of town and couldn't attend the hearing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=101)|
| 0:01:45| The employee was advised that if the plan was paid prior to the hearing this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=105)|
| 0:01:49| the license would not be revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=109)|
| 0:01:53| The fine was not paid, and there was no remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=113)|
| 0:01:56| So based on the contact from the other person, apparently the hearing officer ordered that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=116)|
| 0:02:02| if the fine is paid by 4.30 p.m. on September 24th, the license will not be revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=122)|
| 0:02:08| If the fine is not paid, the license will be revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| These actions require no action on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| I just wanted to make all of you aware that when we do have a procedure that on the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=135)|
| 0:02:20| offense, KPD primarily deals with it, and if people don't understand that a beer license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=140)|
| 0:02:26| is a privilege, not a right, then there are consequences if they don't respond to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=146)|
| 0:02:31| citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| So that being handled, let's move next to the cases that are before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=153)|
| 0:02:39| The first is the Appalachian Mountain Bike Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| If you will give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| Matthew Kellogg, 123 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=166)|
| 0:02:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| Mr. Hunter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=173)|
| 0:02:54| File is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Okay, before I ask for a motion, tell us about your event and when it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=175)|
| 0:02:58| This is the Appalachian Mountain Bike Club's number one fundraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| We started this one last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| It's a partnership with New Belgium Brewing and the Appalachian Mountain Bike Club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=184)|
| 0:03:08| They bring 20 craft beers to town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| We apply for not only our beer permit, but also our state liquor permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| We host down at the World's Fair Park from 7 o'clock until 11 p.m., and have not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=196)|
| 0:03:23| a tasting, but also a small film festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=203)|
| 0:03:25| Okay, and once again, the date of this event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=205)|
| 0:03:28| That is October 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=208)|
| 0:03:29| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=209)|
| 0:03:30| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| That was a light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| Yeah, I'd just like to know what the admission and...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=218)|
| 0:03:40| There is no admission fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| No admission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=222)|
| 0:03:43| The only thing you need to pay for are tokens for samples, and I think those are three-ounce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| samples, $1.25 or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| Okay, and we did approve this, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=232)|
| 0:03:55| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| Have a good time, and we'll hope lots of people come to the event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=239)|
| 0:04:00| All right, the next petitioner on the agenda is Casanova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| Casanova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=244)|
| 0:04:06| All right, let's move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=246)|
| 0:04:13| Let's move this to the heel of the agenda, if that's all right with everyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=259)|

| 0:04:21| Okay, so we'll move this to the heel of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=261)|
| 0:04:24| All right, the next one is the Easy American Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=264)|
| 0:04:29| This is in Councilman Campin's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=269)|
| 0:04:35| Okay, your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=275)|

| 0:04:42| We love Casanova.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| I apologize to the board because she couldn't make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| We have a little baby, and I have a lower back problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| I couldn't take care of him, so she had to stay there, and I come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=289)|
| 0:04:52| I called Ms. Day, and she said it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| Easy American Market is a grocery store and a little tobacco store on 1103 Tennessee Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=294)|
| 0:05:01| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| Do we have the records?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| What about the file?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=307)|
| 0:05:10| We're waiting on a copy of the sales tax registration and approval from the fire inspector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| and surrender of the former beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=318)|

| 0:05:24| I move to approve if they get all the documents in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| I missed something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| I've got those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| I don't know if you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=331)|
| 0:05:32| I've got a copy of them, so if you'd like to look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| All right, we have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=338)|
| 0:05:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=339)|
| 0:05:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| If you'll see Ms. Day, she'll help you out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=341)|
| 0:05:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| The next is the Knoxville Botanical Garden and Arboretum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=344)|
| 0:05:54| They have various fundraisers listed, so we'll just take a couple of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| If your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| Danielle Velez, 10146 Red Hillard Lane, Knoxville, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=359)|
| 0:06:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| The record's complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Do we have a file?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| Complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| All right, now, before we hear a motion, tell us about some of the events and perhaps the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| first one or two that are coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=374)|
| 0:06:16| The main one that this is for is for our third annual Green Thumb Gala.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| It's our main fundraising event for the gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| This year, our sponsor is HGTV, and we're raising money to redo one of the historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| properties on the gardens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=388)|
| 0:06:31| And what's the date of the event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| That one is October 5th, and then we also have a fall festival that'll be on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| No relation to the beer permit, but that one's a free festival geared towards promoting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| nature for children, and that'll be on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| So you'll have a busy weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| Yes, we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=408)|
| 0:06:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=409)|
| 0:06:50| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=410)|

| 0:12:27| And you do have someone now who is in this area who's on your application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=747)|

| 0:12:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=755)|
| 0:12:36| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| That was a question that came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=757)|

| 0:12:45| Well, we keep saying October 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| If you walk past there and look at it, it sure doesn't look like it, but we've got people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=767)|
| 0:12:51| working around the clock, including me, to ensure that that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| You're still aiming at October 8th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| I'm still saying that until somebody tells me otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=776)|
| 0:12:59| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=779)|

| 0:13:10| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| Yeah, you've got a real nice offering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| I think you'll compliment downtown and the excitement and everything else that's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| on down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=799)|

| 0:13:35| We hear a lot of buzz about places, but this is one that I think has super buzz, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| echo Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=822)|
| 0:13:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=823)|
| 0:13:44| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Welcome to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Councilman Saunders, subject to final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=831)|
| 0:13:52| I'm going to schedule those as soon as it looks a little bit more like a restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| And I'm sure that Councilman Saunders will be there early on October the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=840)|
| 0:14:01| Probably the rest of us in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=841)|
| 0:14:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=842)|
| 0:14:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=843)|
| 0:14:04| So next is Union Place on South Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=844)|
| 0:14:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Name and address for the records, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| Marcus Hall, 118 South Central.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Do we need the rest of them, Susan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| Union Place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| Sergeant Hunter, the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=871)|
| 0:14:32| File, Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| We're waiting on approval from the Building Inspector, Fire Inspector, and Health Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=874)|
| 0:14:38| and this is the site of the revocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| Go ahead, Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=883)|
| 0:14:46| It was when we need to remove that revocation from that address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=886)|
| 0:14:54| You can only have one permit per location, so when the Old City Entertainment Vineyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| whatever its name is, when they lose it, that's already been taken away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| So when they get their paperwork done, they'll be able to get their new permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| It's a different ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| The order was issued today and delivered to them, or is being delivered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=910)|
| 0:15:16| Was it revocated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| It was revoked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| Their license was revoked?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=918)|
| 0:15:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| Let me research that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=926)|
| 0:15:27| Can we just take a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| Let's confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| While they're checking, could you tell us a little bit about Union Place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| Basically, Union Place is going to be a restaurant, sports bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=935)|
| 0:15:39| We carry food like cheeseburgers, barbecue, and offer sundae, sports package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=939)|
| 0:15:48| Basically, we want to be a sports bar that you can take your children to watch the football| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=948)|
| 0:15:53| game if you don't want to go and deal with the Neyland Stadium crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=956)|
| 0:15:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Vice Mayor Pavlis is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=961)|
| 0:16:03| Section 4-73 part G says, unless otherwise provided in this article where a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=963)|
| 0:16:14| is revoked, no new beer permit shall be issued to permit the sale of beer on the same premises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=974)|
| 0:16:22| until after the expiration of one year from the date of such revocation becomes final and effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| Even if there's different owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| Well, but it's my understanding is that we can remove that prohibition on that property by action of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=990)|
| 0:16:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| I will take a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| It's not my district, but if that's the board's wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Could we have a motion to remove the license from Old City Entertainment Venue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1009)|
| 0:16:55| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Now, we have these applicants who are before us today, and so what we need is a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| pending final documentations so that they can have a permit when all the I's and T's are dotted and crossed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1027)|
| 0:17:14| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1034)|
| 0:17:16| I'm going to make that motion pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1040)|
| 0:17:21| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1041)|
| 0:17:22| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1043)|
| 0:17:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1044)|
| 0:17:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| The next place is Whiskey Dicks on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1047)|
| 0:17:35| Eric McGill, 1912 Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| The initial report that I prepared on Friday said task class had not been completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1062)|
| 0:17:47| That's actually been changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| They've added a manager who has attended the task class, but that manager, Freddie Gagley or Gangley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1069)|
| 0:17:56| has not submitted for fingerprints or background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| So that would need to be done before they could actually get the license in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Is the file complete, Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| We need a copy of the sales tax registration and approval from the Building Inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| Fire Inspector, and Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Do I have a motion pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| I'll move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| If you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| We also have before us a couple or three places that have some issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1106)|
| 0:18:38| and then we'll come back to pick up those that we postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| The first one is Club Rio, and they were pending after the June 26th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1121)|
| 0:18:51| Ms. Day, do we know anything about them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1131)|
| 0:18:53| I think we're getting ready to fill them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1133)|
| 0:18:55| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Would you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| Yes, it's Blanca Suarez, and the address is 3810 Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1143)|
| 0:19:04| Are you prepared?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Do we have a records check on them, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1145)|
| 0:19:07| We're just waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Are you prepared to get this place open or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| The thing is that we had applied for some permits to do some remodeling in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1152)|
| 0:19:17| and that took a little while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| So we don't have anything set up as far as tables and everything to get the beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| How much longer do you think it's going to be before you're actually ready to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1166)|
| 0:19:30| Maybe like three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| So four weeks is October 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| You're pretty confident you'll be ready by then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| Yeah, we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Oh, we should say yes, we will be confident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1178)|
| 0:19:40| Yes, we will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1180)|
| 0:19:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| Do I have a motion to postpone pending final document or to allow this to continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1182)|
| 0:19:49| Vice Mayor Pavlis, you look confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1189)|
| 0:19:51| No, I'm not confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| I don't know that it's a ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1192)|
| 0:19:54| We don't need a motion, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| Or do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1197)|
| 0:19:58| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Well, we can ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| To extend the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| It's not a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| It's just an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| Yeah, it's just an extension of time to get the documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| So I'll move for the extension of four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| And that would make it October 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1213)|
| 0:20:15| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1217)|

| 0:20:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| October 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| And if you get everything done prior to that, you can see Ms. Day and get your license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1221)|
| 0:20:24| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1224)|
| 0:20:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1226)|

| 0:20:45| We had our inspections today for the fire and the building, but we didn't pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| We still have some things to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1250)|

| 0:20:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| How soon do you think you're going to have these so that you can pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| We're hoping, I don't know, early next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1260)|

| 0:21:05| The next meeting of the beer board is October 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1265)|
| 0:21:08| That's four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| I think that'll be enough time for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Do I have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| If they've extended it to then and they get it before, they can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1276)|
| 0:21:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| Well, I would move that we give them a 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1279)|
| 0:21:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| So we've got a 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Although all is in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| Now, if you get this done sooner than that date, go ahead and see Ms. Day and pick up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1286)|
| 0:21:31| your license and open for business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1291)|

| 0:21:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| The third item was the Icon Ultra Lounge in the World's Fair site, and they're open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| They're doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1302)|

| 0:21:44| They were thrilled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1304)|
| 0:21:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1305)|
| 0:21:46| That next brings us to back to the items that we postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1306)|
| 0:21:47| Is there anybody here from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1307)|

| 0:21:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1325)|

| 0:22:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| I think that some people want to address that issue and address that place, so I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1332)|
| 0:22:19| know if we can allow persons who are here tonight to address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1339)|
| 0:22:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1344)|
| 0:22:25| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| You don't want to suspend the rules and do that because the applicant's not here, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| if you want to accommodate these people, of course that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1352)|
| 0:22:35| Well, I'm going to make a motion that we suspend the rules and allow people who are here tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1355)|
| 0:22:40| to address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| The first one on the list is Pastor Brown from the Paine Avenue Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| If you'll give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| And this is in regard to an applicant, Casanova at 2715 Martin Luther King, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1373)|
| 0:23:00| Pastor Richard S. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| I'm here representing our church, Paine Avenue Baptist Church, which is at 2714 Martin Luther| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1381)|

| 0:23:11| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| Is there a reason why we're being interrogated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Oh, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| Are you good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1401)|
| 0:23:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Assuming the lights are in control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| Madam Chair, we can have a public address us at the, after we address, I mean, after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1408)|
| 0:23:46| we adjourn the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| After we finish the business before we adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| We can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| Is there a public forum type?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| I was just thinking we could move through the agenda and then perhaps hear from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1442)|
| 0:24:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1443)|
| 0:24:04| Well, we're coming back to visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1444)|
| 0:24:05| I guess we've got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| I guess my point is we could, the applicant's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| I don't think either applicant is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| So my question, I guess, really, to Attorney Frost is could we go ahead and adjourn the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| meeting and then allow them public forum after we would adjourn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| We just suspended the rules, didn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| I would think either would be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| I mean, if you all want to go ahead and determine that Casanova is not here, then you all need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| to either act or not act on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| And the same with, I'm sorry, is it Whiskey Dicks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1481)|

| 0:24:45| With romances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| And address those, and then you can come back and what other business comes before the beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1487)|
| 0:24:53| board, and then allow folks to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1493)|
| 0:25:02| So I would take, there's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| I can withdraw my motion, and we can move for adjournment and then have a public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1507)|
| 0:25:13| and they can speak then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1514)|

| 0:25:20| We either need to postpone it, end it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1520)|

| 0:25:30| Or no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| Madam Chair, our Attorney Frost, what happens without a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1531)|
| 0:25:35| Well, one option would be to postpone them until the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1535)|
| 0:25:44| that has been done sometimes in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| I mean, if there's no option, excuse me, no motion made at all, I mean, then it would die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1549)|
| 0:25:59| But if something tells me, there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1559)|

| 0:26:33| Do I have a motion on Romance's Bar and Pool Table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| I can make a motion to extend that or postpone it for, I mean, since they're not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| we can just push it until the next regularly scheduled meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1601)|

| 0:26:49| Yeah, I mean, defer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1609)|
| 0:26:50| I mean, just, I mean, I know they're not here, but certainly they would like to come back, I'm sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1615)|

| 0:27:02| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1622)|

| 0:27:10| Now, getting back to those of you who have come out tonight to speak about Casanova,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| our lack of action tonight means that they do not have an active application before the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1635)|
| 0:27:24| Mr. Frost, am I correct that they would have to start from ground zero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| So right now there won't be an east market across the street from your church or any place in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1649)|
| 0:27:36| Anybody who wants to go there will have to start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| Is that satisfactory?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| I think that's a solution to a problem then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| Do any of you still want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd120918?start=1666)|
