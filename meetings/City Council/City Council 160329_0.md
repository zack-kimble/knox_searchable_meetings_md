| 0:00:40| to remain with us throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=40)|
| 0:00:42| We ask your wisdom for the issues before us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=42)|

| 0:00:53| divides to be conquered and for divisions among neighbors to be resolved with peace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=53)|

| 0:01:05| Salute the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=66)|
| 0:01:13| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=73)|

| 0:02:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| We've got the minutes here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| I have to apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| The minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=128)|
| 0:02:09| I have to apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| We do have a technical issue tonight and so the agenda is not up on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=130)|
| 0:02:11| And I apologize to everyone for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=131)|
| 0:02:12| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=132)|
| 0:02:13| Items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=133)|
| 0:02:14| Items to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| And then the consent items, quite a few there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=135)|
| 0:02:16| We have 11z-11ax certificates of compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| of compliance, 11 A.Y. through 11 B.B. for the pensions, and 12 D. through G. 202s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=137)|
| 0:02:25| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| I'm going to support the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| I just wanted to mention, we have some 20, I guess it's 26 or so, wine certificates of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=152)|
| 0:02:39| compliance that are part of this new law that deals with wine and grocery stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=159)|
| 0:02:44| I was surprised, I must say, as an individual, and obviously hadn't done my homework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=164)|
| 0:02:48| I did not realize that there are 22 convenience stores owned by Pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| I didn't think of them as grocery stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| I thought of them as you stop and you get your gas and you get a Coke and something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=175)|
| 0:02:59| else, but we've got 22 convenience stores that will be selling wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=179)|
| 0:03:03| I don't have a particular problem with that, but it surprised me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| I wonder how many voters knew that when they were voting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=186)|
| 0:03:10| It's certainly a wrinkle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| I had council's attorney, Mr. Frost, check the statute for me, and apparently our legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=192)|
| 0:03:19| defined a grocery store or a qualifying entity that can sell wine as one that gets 20% of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=199)|
| 0:03:26| its income from the sale of food that's edible, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| That's unusual, and I just wanted to mention that in passing, but I am going to vote for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| the consent item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=217)|
| 0:03:39| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=219)|
| 0:03:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| The ayes have it, and the consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=222)|
| 0:03:45| For the mayor's report tonight, first I want to note that today is Vietnam Veterans Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=225)|
| 0:03:52| You may have seen the flag flying on the flagpole in front of the city county building when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=232)|
| 0:03:56| you came in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| I was honored this morning to join Mayor Burchett and members of the local chapters of the Daughters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=238)|
| 0:04:03| of the American Revolution to honor local veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| A lot of veterans were there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=247)|
| 0:04:09| The group that was with us included Captain Bill Robinson, who was the longest held enlisted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| prisoner of war in American history, and he lives right here in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| He's actually written a book about his experience, which I have, and I know we have two Vietnam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| era veterans here on council, a Mayor Brown and a Councilman Saunders, and what I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=264)|
| 0:04:31| to do is if there are any Vietnam veterans in the crowd or up here with us, if you'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=271)|
| 0:04:36| please stand so we can recognize you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=281)|
| 0:04:52| So a reminder, tomorrow, March 30th, we will have the final day of budget hearings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| That will be in room 453 here in the city county building from 10 a.m. to noon, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| then from 1 to 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=302)|
| 0:05:05| We had the first two days of hearings last week, but we had to postpone the final day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=305)|
| 0:05:10| when I ended up having to go to Nashville to testify about the de-annexation legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=310)|
| 0:05:15| along with Mayor Strickland of Memphis and Mayor Burke of Chattanooga, and I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=315)|
| 0:05:19| thank council for their quick response over that previous weekend when we got a letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=319)|
| 0:05:23| out to our legislators to talk about our position in opposition to that legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=323)|
| 0:05:29| By the way, those hearings continue today and will continue tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| Some more amendments have been added, but still in the Senate committee, so we'll try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| and keep you posted on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| But we will hold our final budget hearings tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| Again, that's room 453, beginning at 10 a.m., and the full schedule of which departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| are appearing and when they're appearing, although I have to tell you, we have a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| set, but we just keep it going as much as we can, so don't hold us to those times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=353)|
| 0:05:58| because we try to keep it going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| So it will begin at 10 a.m., and the full schedule is on the website at knoxvilletn.gov| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| slash budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| On Thursday, March 31st, we'll have our annual employee appreciation luncheon, starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| at 1130 a.m., and this year it's at a new location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| It's at Calhoun's on the River, and as council knows, this is our opportunity every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| year to recognize and thank our longest-serving employees, along with recent retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| And this year, we have eight employees that are hitting the 40-year mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| Can you believe that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| Forty years here at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| So between them, that's 320 years of city service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=396)|
| 0:06:39| That's going to be quite a celebration on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| So I encourage council to join me and show up to show our appreciation with these men| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=402)|
| 0:06:48| and women who work so hard for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| This week is also Community Development Week, and it's a great chance to celebrate all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| the good work done by our Community Development Department and all of their many partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=416)|
| 0:07:01| This year, we are recognizing 42 years of the Community Development Block Grant Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=421)|
| 0:07:08| the CDBG program, which has made a huge difference in cities across this country, and 25 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| of the Home Affordable Housing Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| Council is very familiar with these funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=438)|
| 0:07:21| You approve a lot of contracts and budget items with this, and you also know that over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=441)|
| 0:07:28| the last few years, the resources have gone down considerably, unfortunately, and these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| are really great programs that serve our communities, focused on low- and moderate-income families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=453)|
| 0:07:40| and neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| One event coming up this week as part of our Community Development Week is the Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=461)|
| 0:07:47| Area Fair Housing Conference this Friday, April 1st, from 8 a.m. to 3.30 p.m. at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=467)|

| 0:07:58| And the conference theme is called Building Bridges of Equality, and it will include an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| awards luncheon that recognizes individuals and organizations for their contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| in promoting fair housing and equal opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=488)|

| 0:08:14| You can pay your $65 registration fee at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=494)|

| 0:13:34| I appreciate doing that and I think it's a wonderful idea to have Women's History Month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=814)|
| 0:13:41| and to not only celebrate but to learn and educate people about the contributions women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=821)|
| 0:13:47| have made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| I don't know anyone in this room that didn't have a mother or probably has a sister or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=832)|
| 0:13:53| My ears would have been shorter if they weren't twisted this much but I'm just thrilled that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=833)|
| 0:13:58| we're able to do this and I appreciate Wanda for bringing it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| Well, I'll refrain from commenting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| I'd love to ask Wanda Sobieski to come down and maybe just say a few words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| But she can't twist my ears, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| I'm going to talk about the chronology here, the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| And thanks to all the folks holding the timeline back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| I want to thank all my friends who came to be a part of the Living Timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| The Timeline for Women's Suffrage, of course, started in 1848 in Seneca Falls with the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=864)|
| 0:14:29| public request or public demand for the right for women to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| It ended 72 years later in Tennessee when Tennessee finally gave the final ratification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=874)|
| 0:14:42| that was needed to make the 19th Amendment law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| And I like to say that East Tennessee is where suffrage came of age because it was Harry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| Byrne from Nyota who changed his vote at the last minute, broke the tie, and made our state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| the state that finally gave women the right to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| That's something we should be proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| I think that's a story we need to make sure our children remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| And so we have a Living Timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| And if you want to go through it sometime, I'd love to year by year with some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| events that happened along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=915)|

| 0:15:34| And for all the folks who are with her tonight, including Sherry Witt who's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| And we appreciate that you would take the time out to bring this, to be here for this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=938)|
| 0:15:45| And I see a lot of people out there who keep this whole, the history and the dream alive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| out there on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=950)|
| 0:15:52| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=952)|

| 0:15:57| this, but is that timeline on a website or someplace where we can read it at our leisure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=957)|
| 0:16:03| No, but that's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=963)|
| 0:16:04| Put it on Facebook or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=965)|
| 0:16:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=967)|
| 0:16:08| I have a young associate who understands how to make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| Yeah, one of them young whippersnappers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=970)|
| 0:16:12| See if they can come get our agenda up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=972)|
| 0:16:18| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| It's so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| 11B is the resolution respectfully requesting the Metropolitan Planning Commission to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| and develop a small area plan for the portion of the city which may be generally described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=990)|
| 0:16:34| as lying in the 4th Councilmanic District and being east of Broadway, northeast of Interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| 640, and north of Millertown Pike to the city line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1000)|
| 0:16:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| Councilman Dela Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1008)|
| 0:16:49| Yes, I want to urge my colleagues to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| We have had several very controversial projects in that area, and it almost seems like we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1012)|
| 0:17:00| pit neighbors against neighbors about which road should be fixed, and it shouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| mine, it should be someone else's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| We don't want more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| But it is an area that's growing from the county side, and that traffic mostly comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| in towards the interstates, towards the city, towards East Town Mall, that area, the shopping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| area, and we have to deal with the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| So this urges MPC to study the area, help look at the population and the transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| corridors with the engineers, and from that overview, we ought to be able to act rationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| on the individual projects and get them resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| We can't ignore the problem, and it makes good sense to study it from 15,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1059)|
| 0:17:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1065)|

| 0:19:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| Jim and I had a discussion this afternoon about this, just for clarification in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1183)|
| 0:19:47| of how this ties in with the studies that are being done on the Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| So, Jim, would you speak to that also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1192)|
| 0:19:53| Jim Higgerman, Director of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| The two studies are distinct but overlapping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| We have also already completed, I guess it's been a couple years now, we completed a bike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1201)|
| 0:20:09| facilities plan that established, prioritized, developed a prioritized list of projects for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1209)|
| 0:20:19| the whole city and identified the critical linkages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| These four projects are on that list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| These are the highest priorities projects that require a bunch of engineering because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1227)|
| 0:20:34| they're difficult connections to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1234)|
| 0:20:37| The Greenway plan is really more focused at recreation and the bike facility plan is more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1237)|
| 0:20:44| focused on transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| There's certainly some overlap and two of these projects connect at one end to Greenways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1246)|
| 0:20:55| and the third, the best alternative, may turn out to be a Greenway itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1255)|
| 0:21:02| There is a lot of overlap and we do work with Parks and Recreation quite a bit on planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| and coordination on these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Jim, I'm sure they're going to do this, but I just want to emphasize that when you work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1276)|
| 0:21:23| with Kimley Horn, who looks like a very qualified entity to do this work, that when they look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1283)|
| 0:21:29| at alternatives, they look at the cost because obviously these projects are going to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| like you said, because of road and infrastructure issues, are going to have some serious costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| I hope we see some ranking of alternatives or at least some disclosure of alternative costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| Well, we certainly have limited resources to get this done, so that will weigh heavily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1304)|
| 0:21:53| in a choice of alternatives if there are multiple viable alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| In some of these cases, there may only be one way that works, in which case we'll just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| have to figure out how to pay for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1324)|
| 0:22:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1327)|
| 0:22:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1329)|

| 0:22:59| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1379)|
| 0:23:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| Councilman Della Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Is Mark Walker here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| Ah, he's visiting just this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| I guess you had a cold or something the last time, or were pretty sick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| But anyway, appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| As I understand it, as part of this in lieu of tax payment, which the total is $20 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1394)|
| 0:23:20| but $10.6 million will come to the city of Knoxville as KUB's payment for its facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1400)|
| 0:23:28| located in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| Each year KUB does make in lieu of tax payments to the various taxing jurisdictions in which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| its utility systems are located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1415)|
| 0:23:37| That is in accordance with the city law and also the city charter, or state law, I'm sorry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1417)|
| 0:23:41| and the city charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| And there are allocations and formulas set forth in law that dictate how those amounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| are calculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1427)|
| 0:23:48| But yes, you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| And do you also separately assess the water and wastewater systems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1430)|
| 0:23:55| Does that happen later?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| Yes, the water and wastewater payments in accordance with the charter are made only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| to the city of Knoxville, and those payments were made on February 29th, so they were made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1440)|

| 0:25:27| This is fascinating to me that we're leasing the tires, and it's a system whereby we get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1527)|
| 0:25:33| I gather, tires that end up getting more mileage and more damage resistant and maybe one-third| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1533)|
| 0:25:41| of the cost of buying them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| Would you just comment on the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| But it sounds like a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| It is a great idea, and so I'm going to let Cy McMurray, our chief maintenance officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1546)|

| 0:25:59| Tire manufacturers offer lease programs for public transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| They have for many years, and we've taken advantage of those programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| We realize it's a significant cost savings because we deal directly with the manufacturer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| Therefore, we're bypassing distributors and retailers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| Plus, the manufacturers retain ownership of the carcass, which is returned to them, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| they resurface them and resell them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1583)|

| 0:26:39| We're paying $271 per tire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| If we purchased that same tire, it would be around $456.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| For the vans, we can lease at $69 a tire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| To purchase would be $137.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1609)|

| 0:28:33| we will have access now directly into the park with this easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1713)|

| 0:33:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1998)|
| 0:33:19| We have a Councilman Grave, I mean Vice Mayor Grave, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2004)|
| 0:33:25| I know that the last couple of Council meetings we have approved grants that the Police Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| has, and I'm curious as to how much money that they have done, and also to congratulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2011)|
| 0:33:36| them for taking advantage of this situation, because it seems to me that we've had a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| of money coming in through the Police Department through your hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2020)|
| 0:33:45| And so, again, I was just curious, what would you say the totals are so far for this year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2025)|
| 0:33:51| It's hard to say, but I think we're somewhere around $3 million, something along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| I think that's commendable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| You think about how that adds to the budget, and when you look at what this is about, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2037)|
| 0:34:01| special programs that these focus on, it is pretty tremendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2041)|
| 0:34:05| And Janet Brewer gets a lot of great credit for writing those applications and tracking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2045)|
| 0:34:12| them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2052)|
| 0:34:13| That's the big part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| You have to report, and you have to show progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| So thank you, Deputy Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| Thank you, Councilman Dallavopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| It stimulated my thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| Thank you again for, as the others have said, about working hard to try to get grant money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| to run these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Would you tell us a bit about Abuse in Later Life Program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| I didn't realize that there was a separate category of elder abuse that happens in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| community, and I don't want to get too deep into it, but tell me what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2079)|
| 0:34:44| Well, we do have a problem with elder abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2084)|
| 0:34:48| As people get older, and you hate to say that there are throwaways, but the caregivers get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2088)|
| 0:34:55| to a point to where they don't want to care for their elderly parent or somebody that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| they're responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| They're neglected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| They're neglected, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2102)|
| 0:35:04| And so we're trying to work on that to get education out there to people and work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2104)|
| 0:35:09| that aspect of it, to take care of our elders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| So it's less the idea of physical abuse as neglect and maybe lack of care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| Yes, some of it is physical, but there's a lot of neglect that people really don't see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| and it's very unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| Yes, and they're not in a position, perhaps, to stand up for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| So I appreciate you all working with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| There's also financial abuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| In terms of getting access to financial records, it's something that's a problem as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| Hand me the checkbook, Grandma, and I'll take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2143)|
| 0:35:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2144)|
| 0:35:45| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2145)|
| 0:35:46| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2146)|

| 0:36:07| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| I'd like to call on Joe Petrie, the developer, to come give a brief explanation of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2169)|
| 0:36:14| and then we'll ask a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| Thank you, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| My name's Joe Petrie, Conversion Properties, 520 West Summit Hill Avenue, Suite 903, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2179)|
| 0:36:27| This project is on the site of the former Regus Restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2187)|
| 0:36:31| We are under a license agreement with the Regus family to use the name Regus Square for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2191)|
| 0:36:38| And this will take place on what was their parking lot, all parts of their parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| As you know, probably Knoxville Leadership Foundation has bought the site of the restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2203)|
| 0:36:49| has bought the building, and it's their nonprofit incubator and Alliance for Better Nonprofits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2209)|
| 0:36:55| And so we'll be developing on the rest of that block, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| We think of this project as a district rather than just a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| We've been working with the other developers, three or four other developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| in that same three-block area from Gay Street along Depot Avenue and Magnolia all the way to Central Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2229)|
| 0:37:17| And what we think we're doing is a three-block new district in downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| Ours will be called Regus Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| It's a 101 residential unit, $36 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2244)|
| 0:37:31| We'll have over 20,000 square feet of retail as the downtown design guidelines call for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2251)|
| 0:37:37| We are supplying our own parking deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| That's part of our parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| Part of our parking is to the rear, outdoor parking, which will be unsecured for our retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2263)|
| 0:37:50| and then hopefully we'll be using additional public parking under I-40 there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| We have 28 one-bedrooms, 64 two-bedrooms, and nine three-bedrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| if you don't mind me doing a little advertising there, and 186 parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2281)|
| 0:38:08| What we're asking for is what the legislation provides for in a redevelopment district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2288)|
| 0:38:14| We're asking for the right to borrow $4.95 million in the form of tax increment financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2294)|
| 0:38:21| That will be paid back, as you know, by the incremental difference in the taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| I thought you might like to know the new taxes that this will generate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| For the city, it's currently that whole property that we're using brings in about $2,100 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2310)|
| 0:38:38| That will go to $69,700 per year, so it's $67,500 in new taxes to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2318)|
| 0:38:50| The reason we need the TIF is simply there are lots of requirements in a redevelopment district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2330)|
| 0:38:57| It's a redevelopment district because it needs help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| It needs rejuvenating. It needs re-gentrification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| And so there's a lot of requirements with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| and those requirements are things like additional stormwater improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2346)|
| 0:39:12| traffic issues about your building setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| all the issues that are governed by the Downtown Design and Review Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| so different building materials, different building type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| Parking, we'll be doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| All these are in the public realm, and that's what the money goes for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2365)|
| 0:39:32| So the TIF that we're asking for pays for part of those improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| Sidewalks, I forgot to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| And it goes to all those improvements that are within the public realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| That's separate from our regular construction loan that we'll be doing the mass of the project in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| So our developer equity is $4.2 million, and it complements the $4.95 million TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2390)|
| 0:40:00| and if you add those together, that creates the equity for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| Simply put, you can't raise that much equity for this project without a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| and you can't do the project without that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| So ultimately, it improves the area, improves the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2412)|
| 0:40:19| It follows the requirements, and that's why it passes the test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2419)|
| 0:40:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2426)|
| 0:40:27| Now, I think, Joe, I appreciate you taking the time last week to meet with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| and possibly others about the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| It's very exciting, and I think the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| and the elevation drawings you provided are outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2435)|
| 0:40:40| As I told you, there's a little bit of heartache in this one trying to figure out where the pain was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| And then when we talked about the parking and the structured parking garage and the expense of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| we as a city have been participants of building a recent parking garage that is very expensive per space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2450)|
| 0:40:58| We have approved projects as a council that did not have enough parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| and pushed those and let those developers use city parking or street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| And I think here, you're building a space for each of those 101 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2469)|
| 0:41:15| and the cost of that is extensive, and it keeps the pressure off our city parking and off our streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2475)|
| 0:41:24| I think it is breaking new ground, and I'm very appreciative of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2484)|
| 0:41:30| I think all of us are appreciative of the Regas name and what that will mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| to carry on that legacy of that family and what they meant to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2495)|
| 0:41:39| But it's breaking ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| I think as a city, we've got to figure out how to create density, and we're limited in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| So that's why I'm very supportive of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| I'm supportive and appreciative of the fact you guys are building your own parking garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| at a very high cost per space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| And kudos and look forward to seeing it rise in the skyline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2517)|
| 0:42:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| Councilman Dalibanti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2524)|
| 0:42:05| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2525)|
| 0:42:06| Joe, great, great presentation about this and a great-looking project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2526)|
| 0:42:11| Thank you for some of the drawings and information you provided us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| I just wanted to make a comment, and to me this was a little bit unusual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2534)|
| 0:42:19| in that you're there with a flat piece of ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| You're not rehabbing an old building with horrible pipes and electricity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2543)|
| 0:42:28| and everything else that has to be brought up to code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2548)|
| 0:42:31| And so part of me says, gosh, why do they need a TIF to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2551)|
| 0:42:36| But I realize the area has had some historic blight and some issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| and you have to go into an area and take maybe some large risk to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2560)|
| 0:42:45| And I appreciate your group doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| I just think it is unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2567)|
| 0:42:49| I hope that doesn't invite hundreds of other people to come in for free money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| or whatever you want to call this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| But I understand the incentives make it work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| and I appreciate the effort going into a good-looking project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2581)|
| 0:43:02| I would like to remind you that that's a loan that we guarantee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2582)|
| 0:43:05| so it's not free money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2585)|
| 0:43:08| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| It feels that way sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| Technically it's not, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| Right, I think it's important for the public to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| there's not any check being issued by the city here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| This is a financing deal on the difference of the property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| I just had a fantastic project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| Are there any buildings there now, or is it just all parking lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| There are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| Fortunately, the building was rehabbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| Our contractor for our project was the contractor for the Regas building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| It's a beautiful new rehab of a very old building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| It goes back to the Watauga Hotel days in the early 1900s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| So that was preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2629)|
| 0:43:51| Ours will kind of go around it, but ours really starts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2631)|
| 0:43:55| you can see the rendering there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| We want to preserve that tree at all costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| Not all costs, but any practical cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2640)|
| 0:44:04| But that's a big deal for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| and to have the outdoor courtyard that kind of pays homage to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2646)|
| 0:44:10| what was the Regas Gathering Place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2650)|
| 0:44:13| and it still, if you go in today, it still says Regas Gathering Place on the inside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| But it opens to that, and then our project starts to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2657)|
| 0:44:22| So there's no residents or businesses being displaced by this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| No, this is purely parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| I just think that's just such an exciting point in our city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| that we are developing a parking lot into a multi-use facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2672)|
| 0:44:39| I think it's a tremendous asset there on the other side of the railroad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| and so I'm enthused to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| With structured parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| With parking, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| Joe, also I want to thank you for the time you spent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| us emailing back and forth and getting the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| And you've already mentioned about the tree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2698)|
| 0:45:00| which I think is pretty important when you look at what properties that we do have downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2700)|
| 0:45:04| We do too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| Here's a large vacant parking lot that I know the Regas family spent a lot of time making sure that that tree stood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2711)|
| 0:45:12| And so really appreciate what you've done there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| And in terms of the design, I think it's going to be exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| And, of course, us folks on Emory Place, we're always exciting as things come our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| We're coming your way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2722)|
| 0:45:23| You're coming our way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| We're connecting to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2725)|
| 0:45:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2726)|
| 0:45:27| And I just wanted to say, one of the things you and I talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| and this is just really a matter of the record, on the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| the application form that we received was not totally filled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| And so who's your legal counsel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| That's Gentry Tipton and Macklemore, Tim Macklemore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2740)|
| 0:45:41| And then who, as I emailed you, who is the we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| Oh, asking for our partners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2747)|
| 0:45:48| Tom Wolfe with formerly Wolfe Tree Experts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| That's why we think we've got a good chance with the tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| That's why you have the tree, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| Doug White.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| And Tom and Doug had bought the Regas property previously and sold a part of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| and then retained the rest of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| And Matt Hasbrook, who's here with me, who is also our contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2765)|
| 0:46:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| Councilman Della Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| Just a quick thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2769)|
| 0:46:10| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2770)|
| 0:46:11| Let me go back to Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| He hasn't spoken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2773)|
| 0:46:14| Just for the public to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| what type of timeline are you looking at if everything goes through properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2775)|
| 0:46:19| There's a lot of balls in the air right now, Mr. Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| and so ultimately we've got to do some pre-selling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| So there's financing requirements beyond the TIF, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| So we need to sell about 40% to get this project rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| We'll be starting that in the next couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| We're refining our construction costs right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2797)|
| 0:46:39| and so the documents that you have are a preliminary budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| We think that's pretty good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| but those costs move around as you continue to finish the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| and get into the construction drawings themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| We'd like to be breaking ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| We do go down one level from what you see today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| that creates our first lower-level parking deck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| and then two levels behind the retail, which will face three sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| Williams Avenue, Depot, and Gay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| And we hope to be breaking ground by June or July, if all goes well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2834)|
| 0:47:15| Councilman Del Vecchio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2835)|
| 0:47:16| Yeah, just a little footnote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| I've been on a lot of construction projects over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| It might be a good idea to put some steel bollards around that tree 25 feet out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| because bulldozer operators love to back up and run back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| Yeah, we're going to get some consulting on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2853)|
| 0:47:34| Vice Mayor Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| Joe, you had mentioned about the taxes in terms of the taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2856)|
| 0:47:40| what they pay now and what will begin once you get the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| But I think it would be a good idea to let us know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| which you have in your application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| what taxes are going to be coming to the city once the project is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| Yes, currently it's just over $2,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| And then once it's completed during the TIF term, that will be $69,700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2875)|
| 0:48:02| And ultimately what you find in these TIFs is that as they appreciate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2882)|
| 0:48:08| there are more taxes on the appreciated property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2888)|
| 0:48:12| and so hopefully these pay off early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2892)|
| 0:48:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2899)|
| 0:48:21| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2904)|
| 0:48:27| 11Y is the resolution authorizing the mayor to execute a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| with Southern Constructors, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| for the construction of restroom facilities within the Market Square parking garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| in an amount not to exceed $373,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2925)|
| 0:48:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| 12A is an ordinance to amend Chapter 4, Article 2, Division 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2931)|
| 0:48:54| Section R-66A and Delete 4-66D of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2934)|
| 0:48:59| relative to distance requirements for on-premise beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2939)|
| 0:49:05| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2945)|
| 0:49:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| Don't we have some people signed up to speak on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2950)|
| 0:49:11| On 12A I have one person, Aaron McClain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2951)|
| 0:49:16| Could we hear from Aaron first, and then I'd like to make some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2956)|
| 0:49:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| Mr. McClain, please come, and you have up to five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| Please say your name and address for the record, and we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| Aaron McClain, 729 Morgan Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| When I left this room in the summer of 2015 after my fifth visit here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2973)|
| 0:49:39| I swore that I would never come back unless I was forced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| The reason why I'm back today is that the city council has a chance to do something great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2984)|
| 0:49:51| for Knoxville's economic growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| So I'm sure everybody knows, I'm just going to explain it a little bit for everybody quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2994)|
| 0:49:59| If the 300-foot distance requirement was a hard and fast rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=2999)|
| 0:50:04| of course that would be horrific for Knoxville, but I could almost see that making sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3004)|
| 0:50:10| The way it is right now, it makes no sense at all because there's a loophole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| It's easy to get around on paper, but in reality it can end up costing in excess of $5,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3013)|
| 0:50:23| mountains of paperwork, and months of delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| This is what I had to go through, and this is what other businesses in the same situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| would have to go through, and it's not being stopped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| So here's the big thing about it too, is let's say you succeed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3036)|
| 0:50:43| Then a business that only wanted to sell beer now also has a liquor license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3043)|
| 0:50:48| even if they didn't want it in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| And in order to recoup that money, they're going to serve liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3050)|
| 0:50:53| So if the goal of this law, and I have no idea what the goal of this law is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| or ordinance, excuse me, is to prevent these dens of iniquity from opening close to churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3057)|
| 0:51:05| and daycares, then you're actually making them worse because they're serving liquor now too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3065)|
| 0:51:11| So I would like to talk briefly about my industry, the brewing industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3071)|
| 0:51:16| and I believe this ordinance disproportionately affects us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3076)|
| 0:51:20| If you think about it, most places that serve beer are either restaurants or bars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3080)|
| 0:51:26| These places are also going to serve wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| They're also going to serve liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| They're going to get the license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| It's not an undue burden to them because that's what they're going to do anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| The only places I can really think of in an industry that only serves beer is breweries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3095)|
| 0:51:42| Most of them have absolutely no interest in serving liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| Alliance doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| Last Days of Autumn doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| It doesn't fit in with the vibe, with the atmosphere, and I just have no interest in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| The reason why this could be devastating for Knoxville, this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| is because breweries, as much as any other industry I can think of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| provide revitalization and economic growth for an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| Look at what has happened with Alliance, a very, very downtrodden area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3127)|
| 0:52:12| and now we have a coffee shop, another restaurant wine bar coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3132)|
| 0:52:16| and a restaurant opening across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| Last Days of Autumn moving in right next to Saw Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| The building in the middle is now being looked at as a possible music venue, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| The city has wanted forever to build a bridge to Central Street and everything going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| Well, guess what? I'm part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| And I was forced to go through so much stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| I just think it's completely unnecessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| So the last thing I want to say is times have changed since this ordinance was probably first put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| Breweries are not places where people are getting trashed, not acting a fool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| We've been open for seven months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| We have not had the police called on us, nor have we called the police on our customers one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3175)|
| 0:53:00| I have never even heard people have cross words with each other in my brewery, let alone have a fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3180)|
| 0:53:06| So please, please, please, I urge you for the economic growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| for the potential of the economic growth in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3190)|
| 0:53:14| please, please, please overturn this archaic and unfair ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| Can I ask a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| When you went through your trials and tribulations, were you aware of this 300-foot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3202)|
| 0:53:29| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3209)|
| 0:53:30| Okay, but so you knew about it, but you went ahead anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| Of course, the building is perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| Yeah, but I mean you knew up front that that was the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| So I mean it's not archaic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| It's worked very effectively in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| What was the reason that I had to do all this stuff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| If you'll let me finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| And the portion of South Knoxville that you talk about was not downtrodden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3231)|
| 0:53:59| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| I'm very sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| It's seeing an economic redevelopment, but I rescind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| I'm very sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| Councilwoman Palmer, did you want to speak now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| We have a couple other lights, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| Well, one thing, Mr. McLean, when you got the beer permit from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3253)|
| 0:54:19| there was a limit to the amount of alcohol you could put in your brewed substance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3259)|
| 0:54:25| And with the ABC permit, you can increase the volume of alcohol in your drinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3265)|
| 0:54:31| So it's not totally wasted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| You may not ever serve wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| You may not ever serve whiskey or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| But with that TABC permit, you can have the ability to brew a stronger brew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3278)|
| 0:54:45| if that's what your customers want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3285)|
| 0:54:47| And, again, when you started this process well before you finally got your license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3287)|
| 0:54:53| you were made aware by our counsel, Mr. Frost, and by myself and by the business department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3293)|
| 0:55:01| that there was going to be a distance issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| So you did find the perfect location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| You did find a solution for that, and it was an expensive solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| But you do have your business opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3310)|
| 0:55:12| I hear very positive comments about your business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3312)|
| 0:55:15| and I'm glad that the police have not been called by you or anybody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| because that's a tribute to your running your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3322)|
| 0:55:23| If we could just say a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| One, I probably talked about – I was just trying to say what somebody has to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3325)|
| 0:55:31| It's over. I've already paid the money. I've filled out the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3331)|
| 0:55:34| I've gone through all the stuff. That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| This is not about me. I'm not here because of me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| I've already got my beer permit. My business is open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| I'm concerned about other breweries and other businesses in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3341)|
| 0:55:46| I'm concerned about this rule retarding growth in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3346)|
| 0:55:50| The other thing I was going to say is January 1st of 2017, the cap on Tennessee beer is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3350)|
| 0:55:58| So that will no longer be an option for breweries who want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| Councilman Della Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3366)|
| 0:56:07| Yeah. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| We had this discussion, I guess, at the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| I still remain –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3373)|
| 0:56:14| I'm sorry. Were you not finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3374)|
| 0:56:16| No, I was not finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3376)|
| 0:56:17| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3377)|
| 0:56:18| Go ahead, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3378)|
| 0:56:19| All right. This issue – I'm chairman of the beer board, chairwoman of the beer board, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| Thank you, Mr. McClain. I don't think we'll have anything else for you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| If you want to sit down, we'll call you back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3389)|
| 0:56:30| When this issue came up at the beer board workshop, I was curious about how many times this had really been an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3390)|
| 0:56:39| I asked Wanda at the Department of Finance to look into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3399)|
| 0:56:45| From January 1st, 2015 to January 1st, 2016, 111 beer permits were issued, including special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3405)|
| 0:56:55| Businesses that were within the 300-foot distance were the Crafty Bastard, Mr. McClain's business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3415)|
| 0:57:02| Whisper's Banquet, an event center on Magnolia next to the Methodist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3422)|
| 0:57:07| Either they moved their location or abandoned the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3427)|
| 0:57:10| We're not real sure about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3430)|
| 0:57:12| And then Tienda Noni No. 1 on Kingston Pike, which was a Hispanic grocery store that had been there for eight years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3432)|
| 0:57:20| About three months before they applied for their beer permit, a small church opened at the lower level of that shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3440)|
| 0:57:31| That was closer than 300 feet, so they were not able to have a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| In the course of one year, we had the Crafty Bastard, who did get the TABC permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3455)|
| 0:57:42| We had Whisper's Banquet that just fell off the radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3462)|
| 0:57:46| And we had Tienda Noni, who was not able to get a permit because of the 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| At the same time, we have had more recent applicants during this calendar year who have obtained a TABC permit, and they intended to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3472)|
| 0:58:02| One was Moe's Original Barbecue in the Western Plaza, which is very close to the Montessori School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3482)|
| 0:58:08| There had been liquor that served at that site previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3488)|
| 0:58:11| The VIP event center in Bearden also intended to get a TABC permit, so theirs was not a beer only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3491)|
| 0:58:20| There is a church, I think, about 250 feet from that event center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3500)|
| 0:58:25| And then We're Cooking on Cumberland Avenue was too close to Children's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3505)|
| 0:58:30| They did obtain a liquor by the drink license, but they have since closed, so they are no longer in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3510)|
| 0:58:37| Easttown Vapor had a school and a church in the shopping center, but they did receive a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3517)|
| 0:58:44| The Hill was too close to the Anwar Mosque, and they objected, but the owner went to TABC, got a permit because he wanted to serve wine and alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3524)|
| 0:58:56| So it strikes me that this might be a solution seeking a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3536)|
| 0:59:02| We have institutions that are named in the current ordinances, churches, schools, hospitals, daycare centers, and mortuaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3542)|
| 0:59:13| And all of those are 300 feet is the distance before you can get a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3553)|
| 0:59:20| Yes, you can go to TABC, and yes, the state does not seem to have a concern on this issue at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3560)|
| 0:59:28| I'm not saying the state won't have a concern later on, but right now they do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| I asked Mr. Frost if he would look at the distance that some of our other cities require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3573)|
| 0:59:40| Knox County's ordinance is almost exactly like ours, 300 feet with the TABC exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3580)|
| 0:59:48| Nashville has 100 to 600 feet, but if you get a letter from the TABC, council will vote to either approve or not approve your beer permit application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3588)|
| 0:59:59| Shelby County has 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3599)|
| 1:00:02| Bristol, Tennessee has 150 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3602)|
| 1:00:05| Hendersonville has 150 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| Memphis has 250 to 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| It was kind of a strange ordinance, but it depends on the gross sales from food versus alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3612)|
| 1:00:19| But if you don't have a permit, I'm not sure how you'd know how much alcohol you're going to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| And then Chattanooga's distance is 500 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| So I think that I'm not comfortable with being able to get around this by going to TABC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3626)|
| 1:00:33| but I also think that we need to respect the institutions that this is designed to protect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3633)|
| 1:00:39| When word did get out today, we began to hear from the school board particularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3639)|
| 1:00:45| and I've heard from some principals today who are very concerned about a business that can serve beer next door to their school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3645)|
| 1:00:53| So I will not be supporting this, and I encourage my colleagues who favor this to really give it some deep thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3653)|
| 1:01:01| and those who don't favor it to vote against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| Now I think Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3670)|
| 1:01:11| Well, a lot has been said already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| Let me just say two or three things that I'm thinking about in this regard, and that is, one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| this is there to protect institutions that have children or other people that need some separation and solace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3679)|
| 1:01:28| from what might become rowdy conduct or people who perhaps have overindulged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3688)|
| 1:01:34| That was the reason, I believe, for passing the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3694)|
| 1:01:39| The idea that there's a workaround through a TVAC liquor permit can be solved by basically deleting our section 4-66D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3699)|
| 1:01:52| We're the ones that came up with the exception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| and some of my colleagues were troubled by, well, you can just get an easy workaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3715)|
| 1:01:59| If you don't like the idea of a workaround, delete it from our ordinance, and there is no workaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| We can have a stricter law on beer service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3724)|
| 1:02:07| The third thing I think that's interesting, and I think that gentleman's presentation, Mr. McClain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3727)|
| 1:02:13| makes it clear that maybe there ought to be some different rule for a central business district area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3733)|
| 1:02:20| or a downtown area that has things in close proximity, but we have, for the most part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3740)|
| 1:02:28| our schools and those kinds of institutions tend to be in more rural neighborhood type areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3748)|
| 1:02:35| and there's no reason for a business to cram up next to a school or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| So if you want to look at maybe a solution that treats, I don't know, downtown areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3760)|
| 1:02:46| or dense populated areas differently, there may be some merit in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| but we're not compelled by state law to give an automatic beer permit just because they gave a liquor license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3771)|
| 1:03:00| Again, we're balancing interests, and the interest of these institutions that have children or adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3780)|
| 1:03:08| or serious matters like a death in the family in a mortuary, we're there to give some solace and some space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3788)|
| 1:03:14| and it doesn't seem like there's enough of these conflict situations to justify throwing out the rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3794)|
| 1:03:23| especially when we haven't heard from the schools and churches and others, and we're just starting to hear them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| I've probably got a dozen e-mails today as this hit the paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| but I'm afraid that we're rushing into it and we don't really need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3817)|
| 1:03:40| Vice Mayor Grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| Brenda, what did you say about Nashville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| I didn't hear that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| Nashville is 100 to 600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3826)|
| 1:03:52| What does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| Well, it means that some places apparently you have to be farther than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3833)|
| 1:03:58| Mr. Frost, maybe you know that part of it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| Thank you, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3842)|
| 1:04:05| I did some research through MTAS and looking at various different cities in the state of Tennessee, large and small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3845)|
| 1:04:18| The only consistency is that there is no consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3858)|
| 1:04:23| Town of Farragut, for example, has six different classifications for their different beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3863)|
| 1:04:29| They have a 340-foot distance requirement for one type of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| There is a Tennessee Supreme Court decision from 1953 that actually held up a 5,000-foot distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3875)|
| 1:04:46| Presently, it appears there's some town in Tennessee that has a 2,500-foot distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3886)|
| 1:04:54| Some places, for example, Baxter, Tennessee, 200 feet from a place of public gathering or a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3894)|
| 1:05:03| However, it's 500 feet from a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| The state legislature at this point has given local governments great leeway in determining their distance requirements, if any,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3906)|
| 1:05:15| if there's going to be what's commonly referred to as a TBA exception to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3915)|
| 1:05:22| and the different types of businesses, whether it's a church or a funeral home, and the distance requirement for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3922)|
| 1:05:34| And a little bit, touch on what Councilman De La Vope said, 4-66D also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3934)|
| 1:05:41| there's really not a distance requirement within much of the CBID as it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3941)|
| 1:05:49| The one permit that was approved at the beer permit, beer board meeting tonight, fell within that 4-66D exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3949)|
| 1:05:59| Well, first of all, I appreciate the information that you gathered that we have in terms of what's really happened in the last two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3959)|
| 1:06:07| And I've given this an awful lot of thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| And by the way, Erin, I thought you did a good job as a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| And I do want to say that he's been a great neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| I know what he had to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3977)|
| 1:06:19| I sat up here while I watched him do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| But at the same time, though, I think that we have a responsibility to existing businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3982)|
| 1:06:27| And when I refer to businesses, I'm talking about schools and daycare centers and churches and mortuaries that are already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3987)|
| 1:06:34| And sure, someone can go around and possibly get a permit by going through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=3994)|
| 1:06:41| But I have a feeling that those people, if they know ahead of time what the situation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4001)|
| 1:06:47| and if there is a location that they really want to go into, that the chances of that happening can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4007)|
| 1:06:54| They can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| But they know ahead of time in terms of what the requirements are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4015)|
| 1:06:58| And I do think that one of the things that we need to consider very carefully is the fact of the businesses that are already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4018)|
| 1:07:07| If you have a daycare center and there's a beer or liquor store, does it want to be right next door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4027)|
| 1:07:15| Or if it does, if you have a child, do you want to take your child there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4035)|
| 1:07:19| I'm not trying to put any kind of fear into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| But again, I think that we do have to respect the businesses that are already located in that position and think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4041)|
| 1:07:28| And I think that, again, I think that the 300 feet, I don't have a problem with that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4048)|
| 1:07:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| Yeah, I'd just like to add, too, you know, this is a terrible idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4059)|
| 1:07:43| I mean, there's been no huge groundswell of support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4063)|
| 1:07:46| I haven't heard from anyone for this as long as I sit on this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4066)|
| 1:07:52| I went back a year further than Chairwoman Palmer did, and it came to my knowledge there was 190 applicants in the last two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4072)|
| 1:08:01| and only five were affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4081)|
| 1:08:03| So, I mean, it's a very small amount of people that would have been affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4083)|
| 1:08:10| And just, you know, be clear on what we're not talking about a retail establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| We're talking about a beer tavern next to a school, next to a mortuary, a church, a hospital, and a daycare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4096)|
| 1:08:25| Now, that, to me, just does not add up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| Let me just say it's also, I mean, Vice Mayor Grieve mentioned a daycare center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4111)|
| 1:08:37| This is a really bad change if we do it for small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4117)|
| 1:08:43| And I'll say this, because if you open this up and you've got a daycare, and then all of a sudden you've got a beer tavern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4123)|
| 1:08:53| what's going to happen to the clientele of that daycare center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| They're going to go somewhere else, more than likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| If you're in the market for a daycare center, and you see one that has a beer tavern next door to it, and you see one that doesn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4141)|
| 1:09:10| I think we all know how that would come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| And it's also popular nowadays to erect patios outside of, you know, establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4153)|
| 1:09:22| So here we are at noontime, next to a church, football season, NFL's going on, various things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4162)|
| 1:09:30| and you've got all the calamity and all the things that could be going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| You know, people get carried away, perhaps, have a little bit too much to drink, get loud, get noisy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4175)|
| 1:09:42| and people are trying to worship right next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| As our community schools grow, and we've put a lot of money into our community schools, and people are there after hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4186)|
| 1:09:54| And here we go back to the thought of the patios and all the goings-ons that adults take in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4194)|
| 1:10:03| but then you've got children right next door listening and observing, and I think that that doesn't blend well either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4203)|
| 1:10:13| So someone alluded to, I think Councilman Della Vopi did, about the emails that are starting to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| I know I've gotten emails from, I think, three of the members of our school board who oppose this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4220)|
| 1:10:29| And I think once this grows, and if it gets, you know, if it's passed tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4229)|
| 1:10:33| then I think we'll be really inundated with emails from all these organizations that's going to be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4233)|
| 1:10:40| So I just wish we'd put this to bed and vote no on it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4240)|
| 1:10:45| Thank you. Councilman Wallace and Mayor Brown. Do you want him to go first, Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4245)|
| 1:10:52| Yes, I just want to thank Councilwoman Palmer and also Attorney Frost for the information and the research that they did on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4252)|
| 1:11:01| It's very helpful in making a vote on it, but I think we're going to have to be very careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4261)|
| 1:11:08| Those rules were put into place for a reason and certainly want to have some consistency in terms of alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4268)|
| 1:11:16| beer, liquor, wine, we want to have some consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4276)|
| 1:11:20| But certainly I think we have to be very careful in terms of changing that 300 foot sign, a rule. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4280)|
| 1:11:29| Thank you. Councilman Wallace. Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| Well, this came about because some people actually called me about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4292)|
| 1:11:38| both people in the craft brewing business and commercial realtors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4298)|
| 1:11:44| And the light went on the night we sat here with the lady that had owned a store inside a shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4304)|
| 1:11:52| that had since been leased to a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4312)|
| 1:11:56| Churches have moved into shopping centers, they've moved into industrial areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4316)|
| 1:12:00| they've moved into untraditional spaces that have never been in before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4320)|
| 1:12:07| And so there became the idea that they're already mingling pretty heavily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4327)|
| 1:12:15| There is no distance requirement downtown, so that rule exists in the CBID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4335)|
| 1:12:21| and it's worked out pretty favorably where you have this mixture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| So we're building a city that is increasing, we have to increase our density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4345)|
| 1:12:30| as we talked about with Mr. Petrie about his project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| We're increasing mixed use as we're looking at opportunities in the beer district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| to increase our mixed use developments where we're stacking retail and multifamily and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4357)|
| 1:12:45| So it's a trend that's where we're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4365)|
| 1:12:49| We've sat here, there have been a few that we have, I can recount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| six or eight that came to my mind of ones over the last few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| that were told right here at this podium that they violated the distance requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4379)|
| 1:13:05| and at the same time they were given the loophole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| but don't despair, you can get your TABC license and overcome this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4388)|
| 1:13:13| And so it's out of that practicality that this idea came| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4393)|
| 1:13:18| and to resolve the fact that we've put really steep barriers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4398)|
| 1:13:23| for people in this craft brewing industry is very new to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4403)|
| 1:13:28| How we regulate it is a lot different than anything we've ever seen before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4408)|
| 1:13:34| and they're going in areas that are redeveloping and in transition to improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4414)|
| 1:13:41| So it's, I mean I hear the concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4421)|
| 1:13:46| but I think the concern still today is if they can get a TABC license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| and they do get a TABC license and work around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4431)|
| 1:13:55| The untold number that is not being told that we don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4435)|
| 1:13:59| are the people that never applied because they had a distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4439)|
| 1:14:05| And so those are the ones where you've inhibited business development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4445)|
| 1:14:11| and the movement of businesses into areas because of that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4451)|
| 1:14:16| There's no doubt that it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| So yeah, it has some entanglements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4458)|
| 1:14:23| It has entanglements now, but I think going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4463)|
| 1:14:26| what we're trying to do as a city and increase really what, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4466)|
| 1:14:31| multi-use, I think long term it probably would suit us best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4471)|
| 1:14:35| But, you know, we've talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| The only way that we have as a council when we're restricted by Sunshine Law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4478)|
| 1:14:44| is to put it out here and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| And I think that this is, you know, it's good governance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4486)|
| 1:14:50| We should be able to sit and talk about it and dispute it, let people speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| And I think that's our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| I don't resent at all the dozen emails that I've gotten today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| and I've responded to most of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| and we got tied up in meetings late this afternoon where I couldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| But I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| That's good governance, and that's what we're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| We need that transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| We should hear from them and not be about a fear factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| of creating some fear that it's totally unfounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| I mean, this situation exists all across the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| where we have schools and churches, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4520)|
| 1:15:23| right across from establishments that serve beer, liquor, and wine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4523)|
| 1:15:28| You know, so people's viewpoint of beer, liquor, and wine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4528)|
| 1:15:33| is a lot different today when these laws were written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| And, you know, maybe this isn't the exact perfect ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4536)|
| 1:15:40| but I think that we need to look for alternatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| to be able to work around it a lot more effectively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| than just telling people they've got to get a TABC license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| and go through $5,000 worth of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| You talk about the burden on a small business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| To me, that's a huge burden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| You know, they're putting people through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| So, you know, I don't regret bringing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| I don't regret mentioning it several times over the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4560)|
| 1:16:04| but it's our way on city council is to bring this and put it out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4564)|
| 1:16:07| so we can talk about it and get input from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4567)|
| 1:16:11| So, you know, I still support it and, you know, let Councilman Stair speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4571)|
| 1:16:19| Thank you. Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4579)|
| 1:16:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4581)|
| 1:16:23| First, I just want to thank Mr. McClain for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| I think he deserves our respect for coming down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| and speaking on this issue and for what he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| I think it's a real amenity to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| I was talking to India Kincannon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| and she was mentioning how much that area has improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4597)|
| 1:16:41| since his business has gone in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4601)|
| 1:16:44| So I certainly think he deserves respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4604)|
| 1:16:46| and I appreciate the dialogue we've had tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| I'm actually surprised because I actually don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| It's not a huge deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| I think Councilman Palmer is right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| You know, there's not a huge number of businesses this affects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| I was amazed how, in a way, short 300 feet is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4623)|
| 1:17:07| I looked at West High School, and Da Vinci's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| which is right across Sutherland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| was more than 300 feet from West High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4632)|
| 1:17:18| And then, of course, the most obvious thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| of why it's not a major deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4640)|
| 1:17:23| is because there is a giant truck-wide loophole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| and anybody that wants to sell beer right next to a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4647)|
| 1:17:32| right next to a school, or right next to a daycare center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4652)|
| 1:17:37| all they have to do is go and get a license from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| So all the horror stories, Mr. Pavlis, you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4661)|
| 1:17:44| those can happen today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| You could open up a daycare center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| and then a bar could open up next to you, right next to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| zero feet, get a TBAC license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| and then we would issue a beer permit under our current laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| Same with the church example you gave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| All the examples you gave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4683)|
| 1:18:05| So I guess the reason why it's not a huge deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4685)|
| 1:18:08| but the reason why I brought it forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| the first reason is just not logical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| And I think we have a duty as legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4693)|
| 1:18:15| when the laws don't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| I mean, I talk to people about this all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| The laws don't make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4699)|
| 1:18:21| Well, we're in a position to change that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4701)|
| 1:18:23| And the second reason that was talked about earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4703)|
| 1:18:26| is about density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| And this is so logical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| that we've already exempted downtown from this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| In downtown, there is no distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| Well, you know, I think my vision for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| and I think it's shared amongst a lot of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| is that there's going to be more dense development in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| We're talking about in Bearden, obviously South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| Cumberland Avenue is becoming more dense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4729)|
| 1:18:52| along Central and Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4732)|
| 1:18:55| So you're going to run into this more and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4735)|
| 1:18:58| And who does it affect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| It's not the businesses that have deep pockets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| and are going to have liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| It affects, in my opinion, two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4746)|
| 1:19:10| Small ethnic restaurants or pizza places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4750)|
| 1:19:16| that want to serve just beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| You know, they really don't want to serve liquor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| They're serving tacos or something along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| I think those can be great amenities for neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4763)|
| 1:19:26| I think people really like that type of diverse menu options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4766)|
| 1:19:32| And then the other is the craft beer industry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| Just recently, it seems like we've had a number of bars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| like the Crafty Bastard, Alliance, Trailhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| They just serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| They're small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| There's typically mom-and-pop operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4787)|
| 1:19:49| There's no logic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4789)|
| 1:19:51| Why are we requiring them to go through the state to get this license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4791)|
| 1:19:55| if they're within 300 feet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| Now, all the ones I mentioned are not within 300 feet of something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| so I'm not trying to create a false impression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4800)|
| 1:20:03| I guess the point and why I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4803)|
| 1:20:05| knowing that there's going to be a lot of confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4805)|
| 1:20:08| because a lot of people are going to hear beers next to schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| and they're going to think we're trying to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| all the Knox County schoolchildren, but we're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| That situation already exists today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4816)|
| 1:20:20| This is just about simplifying and making it easier for small businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4820)|
| 1:20:23| So it pretty much knows where it's going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4823)|
| 1:20:26| I appreciate all the dialogue, and we'll see how the vote goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4826)|
| 1:20:30| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| This has actually been a very good dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| and I really appreciate everything that's been said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| When I got here, I must say I was inclined to eliminate the difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4838)|
| 1:20:44| just do away with 300 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4844)|
| 1:20:47| Now I'm thinking, I understand, but we have already begun to be nuanced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4847)|
| 1:20:53| as you have both indicated, with the downtown and other areas in this city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| that are going to become more dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4857)|
| 1:20:59| And I hope they do become more dense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| And we need to be as friendly as we can to new businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| to the entrepreneurial spirit that we are growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4865)|
| 1:21:10| You can tell by the comments, this is probably not going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| I can count as well as anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| But I sure would like to keep this discussion going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| and see if we can't be a little more nuanced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4881)|
| 1:21:24| and I'm not going to suggest what that might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| But I think as this city continues to grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4886)|
| 1:21:29| and we've had really healthy growth, and I want to promote that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4889)|
| 1:21:32| that we need to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4892)|
| 1:21:35| Bearden is going to come online pretty soon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| and it's going to change dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| Magnolia we're looking at, it's going to change dramatically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| And I think opportunities for small business are getting greater and greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| And this city has a growing reputation for being friendly to the millennials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| to establish their businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| I want to promote that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| I think we have some real opportunities here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| So I hope we will continue this discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| regardless of what happens tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| and find a way to allow and promote the growth of new and small businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4922)|
| 1:22:09| in this community, and this may be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4929)|
| 1:22:14| Councilman Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4934)|
| 1:22:15| I was just going to say, call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| So I don't think we need to vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4937)|
| 1:22:20| Is there any objection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| Okay, so actually we had a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| and then I started discussion before I asked for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| We technically don't have a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| So we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4948)|
| 1:22:33| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4958)|
| 1:22:39| All opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4959)|
| 1:22:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| It's a 6-4-3 against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4962)|
| 1:22:47| Can we do a roll call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4967)|
| 1:22:49| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4971)|
| 1:22:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4972)|
| 1:22:53| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4973)|

| 1:22:58| Councilman Della Vope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| Councilman, excuse me, Vice Mayor Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| Councilman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4985)|
| 1:23:06| Councilman Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4986)|
| 1:23:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4987)|
| 1:23:08| Councilman Saunders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4988)|
| 1:23:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=4989)|
| 1:23:26| I already had you down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5006)|
| 1:23:27| My memory's not that good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5007)|
| 1:23:29| Too much drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| So what did he come out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| The motion fails 5-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5014)|
| 1:23:35| Well, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5015)|
| 1:23:37| All right, so we will move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5017)|
| 1:23:42| 12B is an ordinance to amend Chapter 4, Article 2, Division 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| Section 4-77A of the Knoxville City Code relative to special events permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5025)|
| 1:23:51| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5032)|
| 1:23:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5033)|
| 1:23:54| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| This is coming forth because we have an increasing number of special festivals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| and things that exceed the current allowance in the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| and exceed the number of days that are currently allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| So we really need this to bring us up to speed with all these festivals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5047)|
| 1:24:12| that we're going into festival season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5057)|
| 1:24:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| 12C is an ordinance to amend Chapter 16 of the Knoxville City Code relative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5062)|
| 1:24:27| to add a new article entitled Mobile Food Units to establish rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5067)|
| 1:24:31| and regulations for the operation of mobile food vending establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5071)|
| 1:24:37| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5077)|
| 1:24:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5078)|
| 1:24:39| Well, a lot of good work has been done on this set of guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5079)|
| 1:24:44| and the information that was provided to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5084)|
| 1:24:47| and the workshop that we had to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5087)|
| 1:24:50| There seems to be a controversy, and it's down to a couple of minor points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| I'm not sure how this is going to turn out in terms of council's position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5096)|
| 1:25:02| but people from neighborhoods have been really concerned about the idea of smokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5102)|
| 1:25:09| We were handed a picture tonight showing a kind of a smoky barbecue tank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5109)|
| 1:25:16| that was drawn behind a vehicle, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| But the concern is that you can be within 100 foot of a residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| and that someone might be subjected to a day-long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5123)|
| 1:25:27| or many days-long assault of the smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| That's not the heart of this mobile food unit guideline system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| and I don't see why we have to rush in at this point to just open the door completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5138)|
| 1:25:44| I don't know why we can't approve this without having the smokers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5144)|
| 1:25:50| especially as they are within some distance of a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5150)|
| 1:25:56| I don't think they're allowed in neighborhood zones at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| but the proximity to a house is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| Normally we allow under our zoning rules residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5163)|
| 1:26:08| followed by some form of office or minor neighborhood commercial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5168)|
| 1:26:13| We don't really like to put heavier uses near residences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| and this is one of those where I guess some of the people on council would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5178)|
| 1:26:22| well, gosh, I love the smell of barbecue and I wouldn't mind having it near me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5182)|
| 1:26:26| because it would make me hungry and I'd go eat there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| But the flip side is someone might be allergic to it or might be assaulted by it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| and I don't know why we have to rush into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| It seems like the opportunities that are being created to have this in an office park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| or an industrial zone or other places, commercial zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| where people are stopping for a meal and this is another one of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5203)|
| 1:26:48| let's create an opportunity for small businesses and entrepreneurs to get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5208)|
| 1:26:53| So overall I think it's a very good ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| I would ask that we not have the smokers allowed at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| and maybe revisit that as time goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5220)|
| 1:27:03| There's certainly a lot of food trucks that cook onboard in the vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5223)|
| 1:27:08| or prepare separately in a commissary and take their food to whatever destination they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5228)|
| 1:27:15| I can see a situation where you have an all-day festival in a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5235)|
| 1:27:19| or in some area where you may want to cook the food on premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5239)|
| 1:27:23| That might be a limited exception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| but the wide-open allowance of smokers I think is probably a mistake at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5245)|
| 1:27:30| The only other point that I seem to have gotten a lot of feedback about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5250)|
| 1:27:35| both individually and at our workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5255)|
| 1:27:37| was the small business casual pint type example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| where someone's going to take a food truck up to the side of a building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| going to plug into shore power from the building so it doesn't have a noisy compressor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5266)|
| 1:27:52| it doesn't have a smoker, and the conflict becomes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| and they serve people inside that facility that want to have not only a beer but some food or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| and that makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| A casual pint doesn't serve its own food.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| There's a condo complex that's less than 100 feet away from it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5286)|
| 1:28:10| and the people from that complex said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| this is not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5293)|
| 1:28:14| We enjoy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5294)|
| 1:28:15| In fact, we utilize it ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5295)|
| 1:28:17| We ought to find a way to fashion the exception that has the sort of non-obtrusive use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5297)|
| 1:28:25| where a business, two businesses joined together in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5305)|
| 1:28:30| at the side door or the back door of the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| without regard to perhaps a more punitive setback requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5313)|
| 1:28:39| especially where they've eliminated the noise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5319)|
| 1:28:41| they've eliminated the smoker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5321)|
| 1:28:42| they're not doing anything that's disrupting the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| and it's kind of a symbiotic relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5325)|
| 1:28:48| But aside from that, I like the regs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5328)|
| 1:28:51| and I like the work that went into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5331)|
| 1:28:54| and obviously the year, year and a half, two years of effort of doing the pilot program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5334)|
| 1:28:59| But I think we should make those two changes at this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| and keep our mind open to possibly change the rule on smokers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5342)|
| 1:29:07| or whatever setback for smokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| But I think it's going too quickly into an area that is controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5349)|
| 1:29:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5353)|
| 1:29:14| So, Council, we have four people that are signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| Do you want to go ahead and speak now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| or I understand that maybe the two sides have come together to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5358)|
| 1:29:24| So do you want to hear now first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5366)|
| 1:29:27| So this is who I have who's signed up to speak on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5367)|
| 1:29:30| Larry Silverstein, followed by Jim Bletner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5370)|
| 1:29:36| Jonathan Borsotti, and Carleen Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5376)|
| 1:29:41| So we'll start with Mr. Silverstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5381)|
| 1:29:44| And as you all know, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| Please state your name and address for the record, and we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| My name is Larry Silverstein, 7808 Sheffield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| I'm speaking as a representative from Community Forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| a group of representatives from many Knoxville neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| For almost 30 years, Community Forum has been dedicated to seeing that the interests of residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5399)|
| 1:30:04| of all of our neighborhoods are adequately protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| Since the end of November 2015, Community Forum's members have devoted much time working with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5407)|
| 1:30:12| representatives of the city of Knoxville to help draft an ordinance that is clearly drafted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5412)|
| 1:30:16| and enforceable and which is understandable by the public and the mobile food vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| who wish to do business in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| We have submitted detailed comments and recommendations to city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5424)|
| 1:30:27| and to the administration in December, January, and most recently in our March 13th letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5427)|
| 1:30:33| Many of our recommendations were adopted by the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5433)|
| 1:30:36| and appear in the latest version of the proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| Tonight, we feel strongly that more can still be done to address concerns we have raised for the past four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5439)|
| 1:30:45| The pilot program regulations has allowed MFUs in very limited locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5445)|
| 1:30:51| The proposed ordinance greatly expands possible locations to every non-residential district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5451)|
| 1:30:57| including many of our parks and rec centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| as well as to properties that are right next door to residences or other businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5459)|
| 1:31:04| It would allow MFUs even in zoning districts such as Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| which do not even allow restaurants or outdoor sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| and in some commercial zones such as C3, which does not allow outdoor sales,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| and C1, which only allows restaurants with use on review approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5476)|
| 1:31:21| Every city has dealt with mobile food units differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5481)|
| 1:31:24| You should know that Chattanooga allows MFUs on private property in only a few commercial districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5484)|
| 1:31:30| and one manufacturing district, and in a very limited geographic area, mostly downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5490)|
| 1:31:36| They do not operate on city streets or sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| Most cities know which private properties allow MFUs to operate on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5499)|
| 1:31:45| Knoxville's ordinance, however, does not have that simple requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| As we have said repeatedly in this process, we are not against food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5509)|
| 1:31:54| We have no objection to the vast majority of what is now contained in the 10-page proposed ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5514)|
| 1:31:59| However, there are still certain provisions that will have a very negative impact on neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5519)|
| 1:32:04| businesses, and our public parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| Wood or charcoal-burning smokers and grills, referred to as, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5526)|
| 1:32:10| external food preparation units, end quote, in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| should not be allowed at the site of the MFU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5534)|
| 1:32:17| Right now there is apparently only one MFU using a smoker at the location of the MFU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5537)|
| 1:32:23| However, there could be many more in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| Large smokers produce a lot of smoke for many continuous hours and present safety hazards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5546)|
| 1:32:32| The city told us in January that their own fire department had raised concerns about allowing smokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5552)|
| 1:32:38| In fact, the city of Knoxville's fire marshal requires only the use of propane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| for cooking or grilling at any event on city property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5562)|
| 1:32:45| as evidenced by the fire inspection scheduling information sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5565)|
| 1:32:50| Smokers simply should not be allowed anywhere near residences or in our parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| which are crowded with people, cars, tennis courts, ball fields, and swimming pools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5574)|
| 1:32:58| The ordinance should not allow property owners within 200 feet of an MFU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| to be able to waive certain ordinance requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| such as the allowed hours of operation and setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| This would not be fair to others living very nearby to the MFU location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| The ordinance should not allow additional structures, such as tables, chairs, stools, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5594)|
| 1:33:19| A food truck should not be turned from being a simple food provider into a party location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5599)|
| 1:33:25| which inevitably will create noise, trash, and drinking of alcohol,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5605)|
| 1:33:29| all of which will definitely impact those living nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5609)|
| 1:33:33| We know that there are many different opinions about how to deal with these and other issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5613)|
| 1:33:37| We hope that a consensus will emerge which will address our concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5617)|
| 1:33:41| and improve this ordinance for all who will be affected by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| In conclusion, our primary remaining issues are smokers, waivers of setback requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5625)|
| 1:33:52| and hours of operation, and the allowance of tables and chairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5632)|
| 1:33:56| We thank you for your consideration, and we would be happy to answer any questions you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5636)|
| 1:34:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5641)|
| 1:34:04| Next we have Jim Bletner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5646)|
| 1:34:07| State your name and address for the record, and thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| I'm Jim Bletner, 3819 Glenfield Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5651)|
| 1:34:16| I was the director of concessions at the University of Tennessee Athletic Department for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5656)|
| 1:34:22| A past national president of the National Association of Collegiate Concessionaires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5662)|
| 1:34:28| and a vice president for the National Association of Concessionaires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5668)|
| 1:34:33| which includes everything from arenas to food trucks to movie theaters to stadiums to zoos and opera houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5673)|
| 1:34:44| Regal Cinemas, Dollywood, UT, and the Knoxville Zoo have been members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5684)|
| 1:34:53| I have taught food safety to more than 100 of my stand managers on a yearly basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5693)|
| 1:35:04| and have coordinated a food safety course for Regal Theater managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5704)|
| 1:35:12| I want to say I am for food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5712)|
| 1:35:18| There's a lot of good reasons for them, but I am against freestanding portable smokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5718)|
| 1:35:27| This topic has been often discussed by both groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| and you don't see smokers anymore unless there is a chance that no one can make contact with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5733)|
| 1:35:40| Smokers can cause several problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5740)|
| 1:35:45| Number one, smoke that can be very pervasive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5745)|
| 1:35:51| Look at the pictures that we circulated with you out on Cedar Lane and ask yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5751)|
| 1:35:56| would you want this next to your home or next to your office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5756)|
| 1:36:00| Not to mention the potential for problems with traffic safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5760)|
| 1:36:06| Number two, a safety hazard for potential serious injury from someone touching or being forced into a smoker by a crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5766)|
| 1:36:19| I received a call at UT when I was there from their legal counsel about a claim from someone that had this occurrence happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5779)|
| 1:36:28| Luckily, it wasn't on UT property and it wasn't a UT smoker, but it sure can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5788)|
| 1:36:37| Number three, potential for smoking for problems from smokers from being towed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5797)|
| 1:36:45| Smoking barbecue is not a short process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5805)|
| 1:36:49| If you're going to roast a pig, you start about 24 hours before you intend to eat it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5809)|
| 1:36:55| and you mind it for a whole day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5815)|
| 1:37:01| In fact, if someone is smoking on site, they have probably started the process some time ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5821)|
| 1:37:09| and will transport the burning smoker, which causes safety issues of its own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5829)|
| 1:37:18| Most smoking is done off-site and is warmed on-site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5838)|
| 1:37:24| Number four, lingering smell from long-term smoking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| At a Bearden Council meeting, a member who has an annual neighborhood barbecue cook-off near her house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5850)|
| 1:37:40| says that it takes a week to get the smell out of her house, and she hates it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| Now, probably for a short time she liked it, but after a while it got a little old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5866)|
| 1:37:54| Currently, I believe that there is only one food truck that is using a smoker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5874)|
| 1:38:03| I would contend that it would be very easy for them to do their smoking off-site and to warm it on-site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5883)|
| 1:38:10| which I think makes a lot of sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| It certainly reduces the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| Weather and smoking and wind can make a huge difference, the direction and severity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5896)|
| 1:38:22| The picture you saw was taken on a clear day in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5902)|
| 1:38:25| Imagine what it would look like on a foggy day in the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5905)|
| 1:38:30| I want to thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| I hope that you will drop the smoker from the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5913)|
| 1:38:38| Otherwise, I think the ladies have done a fine job with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| and we appreciated all the hard work they put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| I will be glad to answer any questions that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5924)|
| 1:38:47| I do come from a point of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5927)|
| 1:38:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5930)|
| 1:38:51| And for the record, he was acknowledging Patricia Robledo and Krista Cucaro in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5931)|
| 1:38:57| Cucaro, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5937)|
| 1:38:59| I'm getting everybody's name wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5939)|
| 1:39:03| Okay, so now we have Jonathan Borsotti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5943)|
| 1:39:13| Is this going to be a team presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5953)|
| 1:39:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5956)|
| 1:39:20| Ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5960)|
| 1:39:23| Carly Malone, 6051 Fountain Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5963)|
| 1:39:27| Jon and I have gotten to know each other since the workshop last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5967)|
| 1:39:36| There are many points on which we agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5976)|
| 1:39:41| I'm also a member of the community forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5981)|
| 1:39:47| Anyone who drives by the place on Merchants Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5987)|
| 1:39:54| especially in August or July when it's humid and still, drives through a cloud of smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=5994)|
| 1:40:01| The thought of passing an ordinance where somebody could be smoking 18 hours a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6001)|
| 1:40:07| within 100 feet of a residence or a school or a church or a funeral home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6007)|
| 1:40:13| I'll repeat all the comments about beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6013)|
| 1:40:15| I'd frankly rather be next to a bar than a smoker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| And I'd rather my children be next to a bar than a smoker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6019)|
| 1:40:23| Talk to a pulmonologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| Anyway, the thought of passing an ordinance that says if you're within 100 feet of a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6026)|
| 1:40:34| you can smoke for 18 hours a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| or if you're next door to another piece of commercial property or office property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6038)|
| 1:40:45| there's almost no setback, just makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| The waiver, residents within, neighbors within 200 feet of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6049)|
| 1:40:59| being able to waive the distance and hours requirement makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6059)|
| 1:41:05| Traffic, odors, all kinds of things extend as effects beyond 200 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6065)|
| 1:41:12| and it's utterly unenforceable since no one will ever know who has waived,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6072)|
| 1:41:17| who has not waived, who has moved, who has sold, who has rescinded their waiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6077)|
| 1:41:22| I mean, that language just means we don't intend to enforce the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6082)|
| 1:41:28| and it means nothing more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| So, John and I have spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6091)|
| 1:41:34| Some of the things we agree on are some of the things we had discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6094)|
| 1:41:38| George Wallace and I and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6098)|
| 1:41:43| If you don't have a smoker, you follow the property setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6103)|
| 1:41:50| building setback for the zone, which in the case of C3 is 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6110)|
| 1:41:56| That takes care of situations such as the casual pint in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6116)|
| 1:42:02| If you have a smoker, you're beyond 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| Additionally, get rid of the waiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| Now, let me say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| If council will get rid of smokers, that's my first request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6130)|
| 1:42:16| If there aren't five votes to do that, then please, for heaven's sakes, get rid of the waiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6136)|
| 1:42:27| You can enforce at least a 100-foot setback, even though that is minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6147)|
| 1:42:32| Minimal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| I mean, that picture you're looking at, the smoke goes by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6153)|
| 1:42:37| a parked full-size van, two sets of cars, and it's still going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6157)|
| 1:42:43| So what is a 100-foot setback from somebody's residential property or office going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6163)|
| 1:42:49| It's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6169)|
| 1:42:51| Everything you wear, everything in your building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6171)|
| 1:42:53| everything in your car parked outside will smell of smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6173)|
| 1:42:57| If we all want to smell like we've been out at a campfire, that's a great plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6177)|
| 1:43:02| but most of us would choose otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6182)|
| 1:43:05| So our agreement, if you won't ban them, then make it at least 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6185)|
| 1:43:14| Reduce the setback for those people like the MFUs that service the casual pint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6194)|
| 1:43:22| to go with the building setback for the zone, and get rid of the nonsense of the waiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6202)|
| 1:43:30| Thank you, Ms. Malone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6210)|
| 1:43:32| Jonathan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6212)|
| 1:43:33| State your name and address for the record, and I'll give up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6213)|
| 1:43:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| Jonathan Bersotti, 403 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| I'm the treasurer of the Knoxville Mobile Restaurant Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6219)|
| 1:43:42| We were formed when the city first started their pilot program a little over two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6222)|
| 1:43:48| We've been working with Ms. Robledo and Ms. Koukouro since then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6228)|
| 1:43:51| as well as many of the original food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6231)|
| 1:43:55| I came here with a big, long speech ready to rail and rant and rave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6235)|
| 1:44:00| and after hearing my neighbors speak, I don't think I have much more to add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6240)|
| 1:44:06| other than I think we're okay with what they're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| I would ask, there are smokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6250)|
| 1:44:12| People have spent significant time and money building their business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6252)|
| 1:44:17| that does include a smoker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6257)|
| 1:44:18| I don't think it's appropriate to ban them now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| I do think a reasonable distance restriction, such as the 100 feet, would be still useful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6261)|
| 1:44:30| I don't think there needs to be any other distance requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6270)|
| 1:44:33| and I agree with Ms. Malone about deleting the waiver requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6273)|
| 1:44:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6278)|
| 1:44:39| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6279)|
| 1:44:40| Krista, do you have a draft on what it's proposing to share with Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6280)|
| 1:44:48| Council, do you want to hear that at this point, what's being suggested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6288)|
| 1:44:51| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6291)|
| 1:44:52| Then I'll call on Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| Krista Koukouro, City Law Department, 400 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6295)|
| 1:45:01| I discovered that they were proposing this at about $6.55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6301)|
| 1:45:07| Worked very quickly, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| I don't have a copy of a proposed amendment to hand out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| but I can explain to you how the proposed ordinance would need to be changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6312)|
| 1:45:18| in order to accomplish their amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| If you have a copy in front of you, if you would turn to page 6 of the Exhibit A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6320)|
| 1:45:27| it should be part of your AIS packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6327)|
| 1:45:33| The waiver section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6335)|
| 1:45:37| I'm looking at Roman numeral 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6337)|
| 1:45:40| It's about three-quarters of the way down the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6340)|
| 1:45:42| If Council wishes to remove the waiver, this section would need to be deleted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6342)|
| 1:45:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6348)|
| 1:45:49| Turning back to page 5, previous page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6349)|
| 1:45:55| I'm looking at D, Romanet 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6355)|
| 1:46:00| If Council chooses to remove the waiver, the phrase on the 5th line down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6360)|
| 1:46:08| where it says, unless waived pursuant to section blank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6368)|
| 1:46:13| that phrase there between the commas would need to be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6373)|
| 1:46:17| So just a conforming fix?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| And then following that phrase, that comma,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6380)|
| 1:46:26| where it says, an MFU must operate at least 100 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6386)|
| 1:46:30| I would recommend saying, an MFU must operate in location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6390)|
| 1:46:35| according to the setback of the base zone, semi-colon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| provided, however, that any MFU using a smoker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6399)|
| 1:46:43| shall operate at least 100 feet from the boundary, dot, dot, dot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6403)|
| 1:46:48| using the language that is existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6408)|
| 1:46:54| Is that it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6414)|
| 1:46:55| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| Is that only at residential, though?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6420)|
| 1:47:01| Is that only for residential zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| Pull your mic down, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6423)|
| 1:47:04| Is that only for residential zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| So that…| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6427)|
| 1:47:10| Read the title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6430)|
| 1:47:12| Right, that applies to anything that abuts the residential zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6432)|
| 1:47:18| or is adjacent to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6438)|
| 1:47:19| So we're talking about all the zones except for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| In residential zones, what we've allowed for is a special event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6442)|
| 1:47:27| that is hosted by a neighborhood organization or a nonprofit entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6447)|
| 1:47:33| We've allowed them in that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| There's no provision for any sort of setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| because it is within the residentially zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6458)|
| 1:47:43| And additionally, we allow for private events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| to be catered at someone's house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6466)|
| 1:47:48| So there's not currently existing some setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6468)|
| 1:47:51| within the residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6471)|
| 1:47:55| I don't think that's what he's asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6475)|
| 1:47:57| You left out omitting a smoker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| You have keeping it 100 foot from residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6479)|
| 1:48:02| and keeping it in an other than residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6482)|
| 1:48:07| Is there any setback between commercial and commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6487)|
| 1:48:12| You're asking if there's any setback between commercial and commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6492)|
| 1:48:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6495)|
| 1:48:17| In other words, I'll use my office as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6497)|
| 1:48:19| There's a vacant lot next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6499)|
| 1:48:21| We're zone C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6501)|
| 1:48:23| Theoretically, the business establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6503)|
| 1:48:25| could have a barbecue cooker on that piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6505)|
| 1:48:29| even though it's right next door to my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6509)|
| 1:48:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6511)|
| 1:48:32| So that would be from a residentially zoned property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| That's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6515)|
| 1:48:37| Residential only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6517)|
| 1:48:39| If that property were next to residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| it would have to be 100 feet away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| So there's no control over smokers in zone area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6524)|
| 1:48:49| office, or commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6529)|
| 1:48:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| But if you wanted to do that, what would you change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6536)|
| 1:49:01| That's another ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6541)|
| 1:49:05| I would probably just move this distance restriction language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6545)|
| 1:49:09| into an entirely different section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| that would talk about the zoning setbacks for that specific parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6553)|
| 1:49:18| So we're talking about the commercial office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6558)|
| 1:49:21| And then just also impose the 100-foot boundary from any other property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6561)|
| 1:49:30| which I guess if you've got some lot that's smaller than a narrow lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6570)|
| 1:49:37| it could inhibit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| But I guess that would be the way to accomplish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| Or you could just ban them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| Krista, can you adequately define where for us to distinguish the difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6583)|
| 1:49:47| between a, quote, smoker and a gas grill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6587)|
| 1:49:52| And then we can decide whether that's what we're trying to define against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6592)|
| 1:49:59| You mean like a hamburger cooking grill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6599)|
| 1:50:01| Like a hamburger grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6601)|
| 1:50:02| Can you define the difference between a smoke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| Can you define?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6604)|
| 1:50:08| I mean, not for here, but for this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| Can you define that to where it's definitive and it's obvious?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6611)|
| 1:50:16| Or, no, we have to eliminate both of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6616)|
| 1:50:21| I can create a definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6621)|
| 1:50:24| I couldn't do that, obviously, in this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6624)|
| 1:50:27| That's something I can accomplish by the next reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| But I wouldn't be able to define that right now without doing some research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6631)|
| 1:50:37| So would we be able to pass this ordinance tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6637)|
| 1:50:42| based on what you presented and what we can agree to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6642)|
| 1:50:45| and then still make changes next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| And if they're substantive and we have to vote on it for the third time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| or would we be better off to postpone it for two weeks and craft it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6650)|
| 1:50:57| I've been listening to Charles Swanson talk about substantive changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| That's right, and that's a word I've learned in the last four years, substantive changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6660)|
| 1:51:05| That would be accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| If you make substantive changes between first and second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6668)|
| 1:51:11| what you've really done is moved it back to first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| Now, you could pass it on emergency on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6674)|
| 1:51:20| But there is no emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6680)|
| 1:51:24| I mean, I'm definitely in the camp that we ought to eliminate the waiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6684)|
| 1:51:33| I think the waiver restriction, the 200 feet and get property owners assigned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| that seems very impractical to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6696)|
| 1:51:39| I think that having smokers, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6699)|
| 1:51:41| where are we seeing those food trucks work well with these beer pubs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6701)|
| 1:51:45| It's been out in the suburbs, and they're invited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6705)|
| 1:51:48| essentially they're invited onto that or around that property or to that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6708)|
| 1:51:51| to serve a particular restaurant or beer pub.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| And the ones that came before us and the ones I've talked to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| don't allow smokers anyway onto their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| Their customers don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6723)|
| 1:52:05| They don't want to run their customers off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6725)|
| 1:52:07| So I think eliminating them in that situation does nobody any harm at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6727)|
| 1:52:13| Eliminating altogether, that's another issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6733)|
| 1:52:15| Do you want them in the parks? That's an issue. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| But I think where they're up against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| where they're with businesses out in the suburbs, they're not wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6740)|
| 1:52:24| And so I'd be for eliminating that part of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6744)|
| 1:52:28| Definitely for eliminating the waiver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6748)|
| 1:52:32| And if there's no objection to the generator running,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| is that a noise and there's no generator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6755)|
| 1:52:37| then there would be no need to offer an alternative as a shore power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6757)|
| 1:52:41| But that was the third objection that we talked about last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6761)|
| 1:52:44| Council, I'd like to give Mr. Wallace a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6764)|
| 1:52:47| to describe the difference between a smoker and a gas grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6767)|
| 1:52:52| With 42 years' experience first starting at Regus in 1975,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6772)|
| 1:52:58| they had a wood-burning grill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6778)|
| 1:53:00| Calhoun's did, too, on Nathan Drive and at Burden Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6780)|
| 1:53:07| I opened up 19 restaurants in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| and used a wood-burning grill from a wood burner to a propane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6790)|
| 1:53:15| The difference is one burns hotter than the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6795)|
| 1:53:19| If you learn how to soak your coals, then you won't have all that smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6799)|
| 1:53:23| And I want to see the number of y'all that's really down for small business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6803)|
| 1:53:28| because what you're really doing is taking away the tool of cooking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6808)|
| 1:53:33| from wood to propane to gas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6813)|
| 1:53:39| So if you don't know what you're doing, you ain't got no business doing it no way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6819)|
| 1:53:44| That's the same thing with people making rules and regulations and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| If you don't know what you're doing, you shouldn't be doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| And with this pilot program, you know, Nashville has a great program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6832)|
| 1:53:57| They really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6837)|
| 1:53:58| They do something for their vendors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| and they cleared away and made a 24-unit self-made kitchen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6840)|
| 1:54:07| to where you can rent it out for $350 a month if y'all really wanted to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6847)|
| 1:54:12| But the thing of it is when you got people targeting your business like Mr. Silverstein| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6852)|
| 1:54:18| and want to say that we don't deserve a chance in life to make money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6858)|
| 1:54:24| or to have a business or to run it the way we want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6864)|
| 1:54:27| you're taking away pro-charts, my brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| That's called pro-charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| I have a choice to run my business the way I look at you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6871)|
| 1:54:34| And as far as you, you're cooking the old way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| Mr. Wallace, please speak to the camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6878)|
| 1:54:39| But he's cooking the old way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| And he might have did all that back in the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6881)|
| 1:54:43| but it don't exist now because he's not cooking now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| The thing of it is is that we, as small business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6887)|
| 1:54:51| have to stick together when we come and speak with counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| So I read in the newspaper where they talking in my business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6895)|
| 1:54:59| because I have the biggest, probably one of the biggest smokers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6899)|
| 1:55:04| But I know how I control my smoke, and I know how I control my fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| And I like cooking fresh meat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6908)|
| 1:55:10| I don't like taking holdovers over to someone else's house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6910)|
| 1:55:14| and saying that it's fresh when it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6914)|
| 1:55:17| And if we're really down for small business, no matter where it's at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| east side, west side, north side, south side, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| we don't have anything in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| And I'm trying to do something for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| And if I leave my business and go somewhere else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6931)|
| 1:55:35| I know better than the rest of the people that left the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6935)|
| 1:55:40| And the thing about it is you can be contradicting all you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6940)|
| 1:55:46| but when it really comes down to it, we still have to make a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6946)|
| 1:55:51| And I'm not letting nobody, and I mean not nobody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6951)|
| 1:55:55| take away my business, something I built from scratch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6955)|
| 1:55:58| and allowing them to take it and put a sign up to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6958)|
| 1:56:04| we're rezoning or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6964)|
| 1:56:06| It's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| You're telling me I can't earn a dollar, then let's hold down a job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6968)|
| 1:56:12| that someone else in third division court grunt for me after 28 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6972)|
| 1:56:18| You know, it's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6978)|
| 1:56:20| But I took the same thing that made him rich and took my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6980)|
| 1:56:25| and now I'm trying to make myself a living at what I do the best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6985)|
| 1:56:31| and that's making a living, making people happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6991)|
| 1:56:34| And whether you like to smoke or not, you've got two choices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6994)|
| 1:56:38| You can go to your house, shut your windows, and close your door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=6998)|
| 1:56:41| No more smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7001)|
| 1:56:43| Just that simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7003)|
| 1:56:44| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7004)|
| 1:56:46| And one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7006)|
| 1:56:48| Targeting people, business, through the newspaper to where you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7008)|
| 1:56:52| and will not, well, I ain't going to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7012)|
| 1:56:56| but saying that you don't have a right to prepare your food like you want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7016)|
| 1:57:01| you know, it's still taking away a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7021)|
| 1:57:05| When you go to a Japanese restaurant, they're cooking in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7025)|
| 1:57:09| So I do the same thing with my smoker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7029)|
| 1:57:12| Whether if you don't like it, move to the other side of the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7032)|
| 1:57:16| or go down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7036)|
| 1:57:18| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7038)|
| 1:57:19| You don't have to walk through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7039)|
| 1:57:20| You don't even have to smell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| When they say it smells good, like Granny said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7041)|
| 1:57:24| when you've got something good and it smells good, you've got something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7044)|
| 1:57:28| Sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7048)|
| 1:57:34| Okay, where are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7054)|
| 1:57:36| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7058)|
| 1:57:42| I don't share the concern that some of my colleagues seem to about smokers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7062)|
| 1:57:47| but that's a separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7067)|
| 1:57:49| I'm curious, though, under Division III, Section A, additional structures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7069)|
| 1:57:55| that we do not allow any tables, chairs, booths, et cetera, in the public parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7075)|
| 1:58:01| when we allow whatever, food trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7081)|
| 1:58:05| I personally don't see a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| Maybe my colleagues do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7087)|
| 1:58:08| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7088)|
| 1:58:09| But I would assume with permission from the city and the public parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7089)|
| 1:58:15| that that should be allowed and removed at whatever the time period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7095)|
| 1:58:20| the two to four hours, whatever they're allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7100)|
| 1:58:22| And I would like to see that changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| I think that was the original proposal, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7105)|
| 1:58:30| I don't see Ms. Cuccaro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7110)|
| 1:58:32| Oh, there she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7112)|
| 1:58:33| Was that, in fact, the original proposal or something close to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7113)|
| 1:58:37| Having tables and chairs in the parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7119)|
| 1:58:41| I don't think it was because at the outset, as part of the pilot program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7121)|
| 1:58:45| we didn't have rules and regulations for parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7125)|
| 1:58:49| And so that's something new after consulting with the Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7129)|
| 1:58:51| and Recreation Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7131)|
| 1:58:52| And I think that's what they had advised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7132)|
| 1:59:01| Councilman Della?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7141)|
| 1:59:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7142)|
| 1:59:03| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7143)|
| 1:59:04| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7144)|
| 1:59:05| Vice Mayor Greve had his light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7145)|
| 1:59:07| Quick light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7147)|
| 1:59:08| Yeah, quick light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| George, were you making that as a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7150)|
| 1:59:13| Your two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7153)|
| 1:59:15| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7155)|
| 1:59:17| Well, I guess we've got to do amendments, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| We're going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7159)|
| 1:59:20| First we need a motion to approve, and then we'll do our motions to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7160)|
| 1:59:24| I need a motion and a second to approve the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7164)|
| 1:59:27| Is that correct, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7167)|
| 1:59:28| And then we make amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7168)|
| 1:59:29| I make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7169)|
| 1:59:31| Do you all want to vote on it tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| Or do you want to postpone and let her rewrite it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7173)|
| 1:59:35| That's really the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| I mean, what do you want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| What do you want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| Do you want to vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| Postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7179)|
| 1:59:40| Vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7180)|
| 1:59:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| Postpone it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7182)|
| 1:59:43| I mean, just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7183)|
| 1:59:44| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7184)|
| 1:59:45| Then I make a motion we postpone it for two weeks and let her come back with the language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7185)|
| 1:59:50| and then we'll continue to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7190)|
| 1:59:54| But I'd like to continue the dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7194)|
| 1:59:56| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| No, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7197)|
| 1:59:58| I'm calling for questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7198)|
| 1:59:59| My motion is we postpone it for two weeks and let Krista rewrite it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7199)|
| 2:00:06| We have a motion and a second to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| Now let's discuss what you want her to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| And that's the nature of my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7211)|
| 2:00:13| Okay, wait a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7213)|
| 2:00:14| Let me see if Vice Mayor Grieve is finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7214)|
| 2:00:16| So we're only discussing the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| Well, technically, we're only supposed to discuss whether to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7218)|
| 2:00:22| But I think if we're going to postpone it, we need to give Krista some direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7222)|
| 2:00:26| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7226)|
| 2:00:27| So without objection, we will talk about what then make it clear that Krista knows what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7227)|
| 2:00:32| she's supposed to be doing over the next two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7232)|
| 2:00:34| Pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| I defer to my colleague, Mr. Dellivoki.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| Mr. Dellivoki, you are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7238)|
| 2:00:41| I think the best thing we can do is postpone it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7241)|
| 2:00:44| but ask Krista to make sort of optional paragraph with the smokers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7244)|
| 2:00:49| or with the smokers in some limitation, whatever we talked about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7249)|
| 2:00:53| She's already identified the waiver thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7253)|
| 2:00:55| But then we can just check box A or B and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7255)|
| 2:00:58| We did that with the sign ordinance when we had sticky spots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7258)|
| 2:01:01| and it won't be that much work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7261)|
| 2:01:03| So when we come here in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7263)|
| 2:01:05| we pass an ordinance with whatever five people agree is the right way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7265)|
| 2:01:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7270)|
| 2:01:11| I'm agreeable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7271)|
| 2:01:12| That sounds good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7272)|
| 2:01:13| Just remember, it was three and a half years for the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7273)|
| 2:01:16| I don't think any of us have forgotten that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7276)|
| 2:01:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7280)|
| 2:01:22| No, I just wanted, in terms of things that I would like for her to look into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7282)|
| 2:01:31| the main thing is the smokers and where they're allowed or not allowed within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7291)|
| 2:01:36| I think that's the major thing that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7296)|
| 2:01:38| And I bring this up because the reason I ask about the commercial is that we have an establishment next door to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7298)|
| 2:01:47| It's the brewery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7307)|
| 2:01:48| Great neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7308)|
| 2:01:49| They have no complaints whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7309)|
| 2:01:50| However, when they're brewing, we smell like beer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7310)|
| 2:01:55| especially if they don't have their exhaust fans on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7315)|
| 2:01:59| And so 25 feet away, they have a large lot that they can put a smoker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7319)|
| 2:02:04| And if you've been around barbecue smoking, you realize that you end up smelling and your office is going to end up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7324)|
| 2:02:12| So there are some problems with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7332)|
| 2:02:14| And I think it's a very real problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7334)|
| 2:02:17| So that's why I brought up the idea about what are we going to do in the commercial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7337)|
| 2:02:21| I think also, though, I think what I would like to see, and I think my colleagues feel the same way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7341)|
| 2:02:25| is we want to move this thing forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7345)|
| 2:02:27| We don't want to delay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7347)|
| 2:02:28| But I do think there are certain sticking points that we ought to have clarification on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7348)|
| 2:02:33| And that would be one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7353)|
| 2:02:35| The other thing, and I think, George, you brought it up last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| we find that a lot of times these smokers are used as a marketing tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7358)|
| 2:02:43| You know, you walk by a smoker and you want to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| I don't want my employees worrying about eating all day long, you know, smelling like barbecue, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7365)|
| 2:02:50| And beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7370)|
| 2:02:51| And beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7371)|
| 2:02:53| We have a great firm, let me tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7373)|
| 2:02:56| It could be our favorite architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7376)|
| 2:02:57| It could be a recruitment tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| Very creative, right, you know, on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| So I think that's one thing that I'd like to, you know, have that looked at on that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7381)|
| 2:03:06| And the other thing is, and some of the barbecue folks that I've talked to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7386)|
| 2:03:09| really they prepare all their barbecue ahead of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7389)|
| 2:03:12| And then they bring it and sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7392)|
| 2:03:14| And I don't have a problem with a grill if they want to cook, you know, hamburgers and hot dogs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7394)|
| 2:03:18| or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| But to be smoking, you know, for 12 hours on the lot right next door, it is a problem on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7400)|
| 2:03:25| So I would like for that to be looked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7405)|
| 2:03:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7408)|
| 2:03:31| Just a footnote, we ought to have Chris to look at a Wallace exception permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7411)|
| 2:03:36| where someone with unique skills to control his fire can get a permit to have a smoker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7416)|
| 2:03:43| But we shouldn't open the door wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7423)|
| 2:03:46| So if there's some way to qualify people for something, I mean, I'd be open to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7426)|
| 2:03:55| Okay, Krista, do you have any questions of counsel at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7435)|
| 2:04:00| What do you need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7440)|
| 2:04:02| You can obviously call them individually during the week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7442)|
| 2:04:08| All right, so right now we have a motion and a second to postpone for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| where Krista will prepare some potential, some options on amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7453)|
| 2:04:20| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7460)|
| 2:04:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7462)|
| 2:04:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7463)|
| 2:04:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7464)|
| 2:04:25| The ayes have it, and that's what we'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7465)|
| 2:04:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7468)|
| 2:04:33| We are now to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7473)|
| 2:04:36| We have three people who have signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7476)|
| 2:04:37| First is Rhonda Gallman, then Octavia Greer, and then Andrew Crickhow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7477)|
| 2:04:45| Ms. Gallman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7485)|
| 2:04:49| And you know the routine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7489)|
| 2:04:50| Please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7490)|
| 2:04:52| and I'll set the timer for up to five minutes, and we appreciate you being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7492)|
| 2:04:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7495)|
| 2:04:56| Good evening, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7496)|
| 2:04:57| My name is Rhonda Gallman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7497)|
| 2:04:58| I live at 2431 Hoyt Avenue, and, yes, all that smoke has made me hungry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7498)|
| 2:05:05| Well, first I'd like to say on behalf of the gentleman here, I can't think of his name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7505)|
| 2:05:10| but when I was attending Greater Warner, he would cook sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7510)|
| 2:05:14| and I never smelled the smoke, but sometimes after church I would go get it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7514)|
| 2:05:18| so I would have to give him his credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7518)|
| 2:05:20| He knows how to handle his coals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7520)|
| 2:05:21| Mr. Liston-Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7521)|
| 2:05:22| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7522)|
| 2:05:23| Mr. Liston-Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7523)|
| 2:05:24| Liston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7524)|
| 2:05:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7525)|
| 2:05:26| Anyhoo, but I can't vouch for him on that, not for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7526)|
| 2:05:30| However, when I grill out, of course, you can't smell smoke, and I can smell it on myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7530)|
| 2:05:36| and my neighbors do as well, but that's just part of being a neighbor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7536)|
| 2:05:40| I guess you have to deal with whatever they do next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7540)|
| 2:05:44| So I would like to help them with that, along with getting a survey for them, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7544)|
| 2:05:48| to get a little more input for you guys for next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7548)|
| 2:05:52| One of the concerns that I have right now is with the trolleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7552)|
| 2:05:56| I would like to be a voice for the seniors and the disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7556)|
| 2:06:00| A lot of people have concerns with the trolleys moving for one hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7560)|
| 2:06:07| A couple of years ago I took the time to actually spend a lot of time studying people on the trolleys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7567)|
| 2:06:12| I would ride K-trends in the trolleys just to see how things moved and shaped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7572)|
| 2:06:19| The majority of the trolleys that ride down through downtown, I would notice that some of the people that were homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7579)|
| 2:06:25| were, I guess, the great majority in riding the trolley, from what I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7585)|
| 2:06:31| I know some people that work downtown in other areas to get to and from, they also ride the trolleys as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7591)|
| 2:06:36| However, I would ask a lot of questions to the homeless, why are you riding the trolleys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7596)|
| 2:06:40| and I noticed a lot of movement, especially during the first of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7600)|
| 2:06:44| Some would say that they didn't have anywhere to go because of the weather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7604)|
| 2:06:48| They would stay just to have somewhere to stay covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7608)|
| 2:06:52| Also, I am a great user of the library downtown, so I also noticed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7612)|
| 2:06:57| especially when I was trying to do papers or get information, sometimes I couldn't get in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7617)|
| 2:07:01| But again, that was a place for people to go and, I guess, provide some type of shelter until they could eat or whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7621)|
| 2:07:09| But now what has come to surface is the concern with the disabled and the senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7629)|
| 2:07:15| I really feel that they need that trolley service available at least in 30-minute increments opposed to an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7635)|
| 2:07:24| because you're dealing with people that are handicapped and disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7644)|
| 2:07:27| Some people are on medications, cannot stand long, and have appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7647)|
| 2:07:32| I do notice during the first of the month a lot of people do travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7652)|
| 2:07:35| However, since they are seniors and they have different ailments, for instance, doctor's appointments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7655)|
| 2:07:42| the grocery stores, or to pick up their medication, because being in the inner city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7662)|
| 2:07:47| CVS and Walgreens are no longer there, so the distance is longer to get your meds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7667)|
| 2:07:53| I would like to do a little survey on that again and ask more questions and bring that back to the table as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7673)|
| 2:08:02| But what I would like for everybody to do is think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7682)|
| 2:08:05| We all have parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7685)|
| 2:08:07| There are grandparents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| I don't know if any of us still have grandparents living.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7689)|
| 2:08:11| I actually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7691)|
| 2:08:12| I help take care of my grandmother from 7.30 to 11.30 Monday through Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7692)|
| 2:08:17| She has dementia, and then I try to work my way around through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7697)|
| 2:08:21| But if you go back and ask your parents and loved ones, how would you feel if you knew that you were working a 9 to 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7701)|
| 2:08:28| or maybe living out of town from your parents, and that was their means of transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7708)|
| 2:08:33| would you want your parent to be able to have access to transportation once an hour or every 30 minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7713)|
| 2:08:41| The best thing I could ask us all to do is to actually go back and ask some of our parents what they think, what they feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7721)|
| 2:08:47| I, too, will get the surveys on that to bring those forth because, in actuality, I've worked at nursing homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7727)|
| 2:08:54| I still do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7734)|
| 2:08:55| I go as needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7735)|
| 2:08:57| But I see sometimes that we actually treat our pets better than our seniors sometimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7737)|
| 2:09:03| One minute, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7743)|
| 2:09:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7744)|
| 2:09:05| So what we don't want to do is just overlook them because, remember, your mothers, grandmothers, they are actually libraries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7745)|
| 2:09:12| and we can get a lot of information from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7752)|
| 2:09:14| So be mindful of that, and I'll see you guys next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7754)|
| 2:09:18| You guys have a wonderful day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7758)|
| 2:09:20| Thank you, Ms. Common.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7760)|
| 2:09:24| We have Octavia Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7764)|
| 2:09:34| Obviously, I'm not Octavia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7774)|
| 2:09:35| My name is Andrew Crickow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7775)|
| 2:09:37| She had to leave because she had some classes and everything she had to attend to tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7777)|
| 2:09:42| so she needed to depart to be able to take care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7782)|
| 2:09:46| I'm also, her and I are also with the Knoxville Homeless Collective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7786)|
| 2:09:50| Eddie Young is back here, as you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7790)|
| 2:09:53| We were here two weeks ago and discussing the Homeless Bill of Rights that several of you have been versed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7793)|
| 2:10:03| She was going to discuss on the aspects of personal property, camping issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7803)|
| 2:10:09| and some of the harassment that has been apparently done to a lot of the campers by KPD and KCSO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7809)|
| 2:10:21| Yeah, she was going to discuss all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7821)|
| 2:10:25| My only knowledge of this are those that I have talked to that has had ten minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7825)|
| 2:10:30| or less to evacuate their campsite before getting bulldozed over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| or just totally ripped up, thrown in the back of a truck, and hauled off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7834)|
| 2:10:41| My point of argument was as far as the resources available for the homeless community to be able to get up off the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7841)|
| 2:10:50| to get into low-income housing, jobs, and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7850)|
| 2:10:53| One of the discussions was held about felony charges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7853)|
| 2:10:58| that if somebody has felonies, it automatically unincludes them from KCDC, HUD housing, and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7858)|
| 2:11:05| because they do not work with that much of a felony history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7865)|
| 2:11:10| Some may ask, well, what about felony expungement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7870)|
| 2:11:16| I have talked to several people who have gone to investigate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7876)|
| 2:11:21| You can go pretty much to any BOPP office, Board of Probation or Parole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7881)|
| 2:11:27| to where you can enroll in a felony expungement class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7887)|
| 2:11:31| What this does is it gives you the knowledge and the tools to be able to pursue legal action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7891)|
| 2:11:37| to get the felonies taken off your record, to reinstate your voting rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7897)|
| 2:11:43| to be able to then apply for housing and everything, but not every felony can be expunged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7903)|
| 2:11:49| Some felonies can be lifted to the point to where you can have voting rights reinstated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7909)|
| 2:11:55| but still not completely lifted to where you still have lack of housing options because of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7915)|
| 2:12:01| I wish I had had time to gather more data on this, so I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7921)|
| 2:12:10| One of the other things that I wanted to address was that also two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7930)|
| 2:12:15| the Knoxville Homeless Collective had extended an invitation for communication between us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7935)|
| 2:12:22| and all of you with any questions, comments, concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7942)|
| 2:12:28| We've also extended an invitation to come and sit in our meetings that we hold every Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7948)|
| 2:12:34| be it at a place of business or a campsite, wherever space allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7954)|
| 2:12:40| Marshall Stair was one that actually met us and talked with us and discussed with us this Homeless Bill of Rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7960)|
| 2:12:48| Fenbar Saunders has also attended some of our collective meetings that we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7968)|
| 2:12:54| and has even attended one that we held at one of the campsites, which has since been bulldozed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7974)|
| 2:13:01| So once again, we are here, we are extending our hand to invite you to attend our meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7981)|
| 2:13:09| which are held every Friday at 930, be it at a campsite or on the stage at Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7989)|
| 2:13:16| We do have permission to use a small section in Subway during adverse weather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=7996)|
| 2:13:22| but rain or shine, we have these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=8002)|
| 2:13:25| Rain or shine, you are welcome to come and meet us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=8005)|
| 2:13:29| Currently we have a spot set at one of the campsites over off of Bernard Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=8009)|
| 2:13:34| where I believe it is over by where the old, still in use, neon sign factory is, right there off of Bernard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=8014)|
| 2:13:46| One minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=8026)|
| 2:13:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=8028)|
| 2:13:49| There's a campsite that has opened their doors to us to be able to hold our meetings there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=8029)|
| 2:13:54| and all of you are welcome to join us at that campsite, or if that's too much out of your comfort zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=8034)|
| 2:14:01| you can contact us at knoxhomelesscollective.org, I believe, dot com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=8041)|
| 2:14:13| Oh, Gmail, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| Forgive me for being so ill-prepared for this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=8055)|
| 2:14:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=8059)|
| 2:14:20| knoxhomelesscollective at gmail.com.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| That is the email address that you would be able to reach anyone on the Homeless Collective, Eddie Young,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=8064)|
| 2:14:30| to perhaps even yourself suggest a place of your choosing that we could meet at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=8070)|
| 2:14:35| But our door is always open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=8075)|
| 2:14:37| We welcome any questions, comments, and concerns that you may have, and we do hope you respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=8077)|
| 2:14:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=8082)|
| 2:14:43| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=8083)|
| 2:14:49| That's the end of our agenda, so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160329?start=8089)|
