| 0:05:07| Mathematics textbooks for the 2011-2012 school year. Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=307)|
| 0:05:14| Is there a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| Discussion I see. Mr. McIntyre here. He just walked in. Dr. McIntyre. Would you join us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| We're on the item about these school books the 2.9 million if you wouldn't mind addressing us on that, please question. Yes, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=321)|
| 0:05:27| This is 2.9 from the fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=327)|
| 0:05:31| Whose fund balance? Yes, that's what I wanted. Mr. McIntyre to address. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=331)|
| 0:05:36| Yes, sir, would you address us on this and give us the background and what you're asking for the 2.9 million is on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=336)|
| 0:05:43| Is a fund balance designation for Knox County Schools fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| this is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| mathematics textbooks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=349)|
| 0:05:51| This is a fairly urgent need in that the state of Tennessee changed our curriculum and our academic standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| Two years ago, and I think we've talked a lot a good bit about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=358)|
| 0:06:01| And in several of our grades really the instructional materials that we have right now aren't as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=361)|
| 0:06:08| To those new standards as we need them to be and so you may recall that in the budget this deliberations and discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=368)|
| 0:06:15| there was some conversation about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| potential ways to fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=378)|
| 0:06:20| This textbook need that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| And this is really the only option that we have left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=382)|
| 0:06:26| That we but we feel confident that the you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=386)|
| 0:06:29| That the dollars are there and that we have that this is a pretty substantial need that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=389)|
| 0:06:34| That we want to make sure that we address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=394)|
| 0:06:35| Make sure we have the instructional materials that we need for our teachers to be able to effectively provide instruction to our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| And I think when you look at some of the challenges that we see in our student outcome data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=401)|
| 0:06:46| mathematics particularly at the middle school level is one of the areas that we want to make sure that we continue to focus on and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=406)|
| 0:06:51| Continue to make improvements on and I think this will really help us to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=411)|
| 0:06:56| The question was we weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=416)|
| 0:06:59| Increasing the school's approved budget by this much. No, sir. This is a fund balance designation. Mr. Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=419)|
| 0:07:08| Your question yeah quick quick, what does that come out to a book, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=428)|
| 0:07:13| I don't on it's a it's an entire package. So it's it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| Instructional materials from grades K through 12 and really at the lower levels. You don't really even have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=438)|
| 0:07:24| Textbooks per se you have workbooks you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| manipulatives you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=449)|
| 0:07:31| What we call consumables which are one-time use types of materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=451)|
| 0:07:35| So I wouldn't say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=455)|
| 0:07:37| You know that that I can give you any kind of meaningful average of what the costs per book would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| But you know, there are textbooks that are fairly, you know getting into the into the 50 60 70 plus dollar range per textbook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=463)|
| 0:07:51| I just didn't know if you had very many avenues that you you all got to choose from it that you could shop it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| Much or is it pretty well set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| My understanding is we don't we have the Tennessee Book Company is our is what we are required to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=478)|
| 0:08:05| And they you know, they do have fairly competitive pricing as I understand it, but that's that's the procurement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| Avenue that we're required to go through. I will say that a lot of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| textbooks do come with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| Electronic materials and online resources as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| And I think that's a huge benefit to us and our teachers and our students in that a lot of students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=502)|
| 0:08:28| can access the textbook online at home if they if they if they need to if they forget their textbook or wherever it may be so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=508)|
| 0:08:35| That that aspect of the procurement really has been pretty beneficial and has increased the last several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=515)|
| 0:08:41| We looked at online resources and electronic resources as potentially the sole means of providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| Instructional materials for mathematics, but really that it's not quite there yet in terms of the cost-benefit in the technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=527)|
| 0:08:53| I suspect that this will probably be the because it's typically on a six-year cycle that this will probably be the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=533)|
| 0:09:00| Math math textbook adoption that we do that will be physical textbooks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| I assume by five six years down the road will be in a position to purchase largely electronic materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=544)|
| 0:09:11| But this procurement does include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| Supplemental materials that are online and electronic materials as well. Thank you. Mr. Olin be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=553)|
| 0:09:21| Yeah, dr. McIntyre, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=561)|
| 0:09:25| Understand this is a need that that we're going to have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| but with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=570)|
| 0:09:32| The grants that we're going to be losing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| And we're going to be in a seven million dollar shortfall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| I'm thinking this money can probably be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=578)|
| 0:09:42| Used better next year. Maybe is that a possibility? I mean maybe try to get it from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=582)|
| 0:09:48| I don't know where we get it from but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=588)|
| 0:09:51| I'm just I'm worried about the seven million dollar shortfall that we're going to be in next year Commissioner. I am too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=591)|
| 0:09:57| I guess the way I look at this is it is a it is it is a need it is a great need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| It's an important need and it's a priority for us. And also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| When you look at sort of sources of revenue and you look at how we spend our money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| The seven million dollars is really going to be a an ongoing and recurring challenge, right? That's going to be dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=610)|
| 0:10:18| for for ongoing expenses that we'll need to cover and we'll need to find a way to do that when we're going to need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| Do that through a variety of different strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| Fund balance really should only be used for one-time expenditures if you're going to if you're going to spend reserve dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| It really should be something for something that isn't an ongoing recurring cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| And so we feel like it's a good match between the the need that we have and the source of funds that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=635)|
| 0:10:41| There's no question that we're going to still face substantial challenges for fiscal year 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| And you know, we're going to have to face those and we're going to have to work through those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=646)|
| 0:10:50| But I feel like this is an important need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=650)|
| 0:10:53| We really need to make sure that we have appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=653)|
| 0:10:57| Instructional materials for our teachers and our kids in mathematics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=657)|
| 0:11:00| Well, we're not going to make the kind of gains that we need to make to show improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| We you know, we're making great improvement. We got preliminary data last week that showed we're we're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=664)|
| 0:11:11| Improvements and substantial improvements in mathematics, but still only 47% of our students are proficient or advanced in mathematics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=671)|
| 0:11:18| Now it's a it's a very rigorous standard. It's a much more rigorous standard than we faced in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| But you know, obviously that's not acceptable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=682)|
| 0:11:24| We need to make much more progress and and see much better outcomes than that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=684)|
| 0:11:30| So this is one way to ensure, you know to help us do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=690)|
| 0:11:34| It's one of several strategies in mathematics and I really think it's a great need and necessity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=694)|
| 0:11:39| We're gonna have to you know, really all work together next year around some of the challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| We're going to face for fiscal year 12, but I don't see the two as sort of mutually exclusive or competing. Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| Don't reason us when was the last time we just updated this will be updated books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| When was the last time we had the updated books that we purchased for mathematics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| It would have been I believe six years ago five or six years ago. Okay. Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| Thanks. Well, let's take our fund balance to what's this approximately three million is taking them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=725)|
| 0:12:12| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| school districts in the state of Tennessee are required to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| Maintain a 3% fund balance. And so for us that's around rough numbers about 11 million dollars if we execute this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=736)|
| 0:12:24| Transaction that would leave us with about five million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| Excuse me. Yeah about five million dollars over that 3% requirement. So we still have a little bit of a cushion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=748)|
| 0:12:35| it's you know, it's getting close to our requirement, but we still feel like we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| reasonable level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| Resources over and above that required 3% for us to be able to rely on so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| You know, I think it it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| Anytime that you designate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| Expenditures out of a fund balance. That's a risk that you take but I think this is a reasonable risk and I think it's an important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=772)|
| 0:12:59| Action for us to take to support the learning of our children any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=779)|

| 0:13:56| Second there a second all those in favor say aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| Yes question. Well, I just like to get someone to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| Explain exactly what we're that was my question what we're doing here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=844)|
| 0:14:12| Do y'all have a copy of the of the memorandum I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=852)|
| 0:14:19| Wasn't sure if it was added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| Law direct law director Jared I think was working on a copy with City Law Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| But I have not seen a copy. So well essentially what the MO use it's just going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| Formalize the agreement with the $25,000 to pay for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=873)|
| 0:14:40| The rides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=880)|
| 0:14:42| They're going to use the $25,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| To go towards a senior ride program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| Grant is it it's my understanding that's going to be a one-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| $25 contribution and then henceforth when that is expired. There was no further funding from the county. That's correct idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=892)|
| 0:14:59| Well that that maybe is my concern I can understand this year's budget for us not funding this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=899)|
| 0:15:05| But I think if we pass this am I correct if we pass this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| We're basically closed off that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| That window that vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=912)|
| 0:15:20| Yeah that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| Fathers man again, let's let's you know, let's not move out too fast. I mean we funded it at this level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=923)|
| 0:15:31| Next year we can fund it at whatever level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=931)|
| 0:15:34| Commission would like but but for us to do something I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=934)|
| 0:15:37| That's a little more far-reaching than than one year's budget. I would hesitate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=937)|
| 0:15:44| In doing that because we don't know what's what next year's gonna gonna bring to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| I just think this might be a little premature for us to cut this program off, which is basically what this MOU would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=949)|
| 0:15:57| at this point without a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| Lot of effort to reestablish an MOU if we just funded at $25,000, which what we've already passed in this year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=959)|
| 0:16:07| Next year if the mayor puts $2 and or $200,000 and that that would give us something to discuss for next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=967)|
| 0:16:15| But no, you know again, let's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| Move out too fast. Yes. I just wanted to say that all you give us your name and address for the record, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| John Troyer 400, Maine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=983)|
| 0:16:26| What we're trying to accomplish through this proposal is just to mirror what's in the budget and not make any long-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=986)|
| 0:16:34| Connections other than to say there's $25,000 in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| This would provide that up to $25,000 and that's all that's provided in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| And you know, it doesn't match up with any future decisions or any future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1002)|
| 0:16:49| Opportunities. Well, I thought I just heard something a little contrary to that. I thought the MOU said that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1009)|
| 0:16:58| Correct me if I'm wrong. I thought I don't know if it was law director or grant said that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1018)|
| 0:17:02| This would this would I think the law director agreed that after this year that we would have to write a separate MOU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1022)|
| 0:17:09| To do something different. I think it said additional words about we're not going to fund it anymore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1029)|
| 0:17:13| I wouldn't mind saying that we have an MOU. We're going to fund it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1033)|
| 0:17:18| $25,000 this year period that's right. That's exactly what we're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1038)|
| 0:17:22| Is there any I guess I'll look to the law director and ask are there any other words in addition to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1042)|
| 0:17:29| Or is that all that it says? No, I was asked to draft a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| To comport with the request which was to have a one-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| Payment or contribution of $25,000 and then once that's exhausted the MOU is then voided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1058)|
| 0:17:44| So there after that there will be no MOU now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| In terms of the mechanics of drafting a new MOU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| Really? All we need is the terms of conditions the Commission wants and you know, that's it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1070)|
| 0:17:54| That's a simple paper grill, but this is designed to terminate upon the exhaustion of the monies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1074)|
| 0:18:01| And I'd like to contrast Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| What's was approved for the 2010-2011 fiscal year the budget number I think was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1085)|
| 0:18:12| $70,000 but the MOU was based on ridership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| and so even though the County Commission approved a budget of $70,000 we're going to have to submit for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1095)|
| 0:18:22| Commission approval a line item transfer for another seven or ten thousand dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| Because ridership was more than what we anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1107)|
| 0:18:29| And so what we're trying to do is just match the MOU with the amount budgeted and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1109)|
| 0:18:34| Stick with that and we don't want to go over what's allowed. And so we're we're just trying to be responsible and match the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1114)|
| 0:18:43| Mr. Norman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1123)|
| 0:18:46| Thank You mr. Chairman, what what does the city contribute to this ridership senior ridership? Do we know nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1126)|
| 0:18:54| It's a it's a county funded program all all County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| Okay, do what was the ridership in the last year where we exceeded the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1138)|
| 0:19:05| Yeah, I think the number is going to approach 77 or $78,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| $78,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1151)|
| 0:19:13| okay, so in your discussions of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1153)|
| 0:19:16| the credibility of the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| Well, I mean, I just don't understand how it would exceed the 70 that was allotted in 210 and drop it to 25| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1159)|
| 0:19:28| MOU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| State well one the the previous MOU ends on June the 30th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1169)|
| 0:19:34| 2011 so that that previous MOU is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| But that previous MOU said that the county would pay based on ridership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| And it was independent of what was allowed in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1185)|
| 0:19:48| And so what we had is a budget amount that because ridership was more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| We're going to end up and and make a request next month for a line item transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1192)|
| 0:19:58| To pay for last year because ridership was more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1202)|

| 0:22:57| Mr. McKenzie, well, I guess I just like just just kind of a general overview of the process that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1377)|
| 0:23:05| IDB went through and what their feelings were. Sure. My name is Todd Napier. I'm here on behalf of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1385)|
| 0:23:12| Industrial Development Board of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1392)|
| 0:23:15| Address 17 Market Square number 201 Knoxville, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| Was here two or three months ago as you may recall and presented an application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1399)|
| 0:23:26| For a project known as Deer Park for a TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| As we discussed at that time and then what the resolution it was passed sent that on to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| Industrial Development Board to prepare an economic impact plan and submit that to County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1419)|
| 0:23:47| Since that time we have reviewed the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| Reviewed the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| Looked at their the costs that they have prepared and deemed that those costs for what they're proposing to do were in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1432)|
| 0:24:01| The application review committee met on May 31st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| Made a recommendation to approve that it went on to the full board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| At that time on June 14th, and it was a public hearing held| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| at in a resolution passed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| Prepare and submit an economic impact plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1458)|
| 0:24:22| And so that was what was sent to you and then you have before you I have passed out just to make things a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| Bit easier and to remind you a package of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| One of which is a sheet that looks about like it looks like this and it describes the plan area and the project area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| It's probably the third page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| This project is located on the northwest corner of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1482)|
| 0:24:46| Watt Road or Everett Road and I 4075. It's about 140 acres and within that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1486)|
| 0:24:54| Plan area. There's a hundred acres that are it's owned by the applicant to be developed as Deer Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1494)|
| 0:25:03| And what they've it's being requested is it would use 6.1 million dollars worth of borrowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1503)|
| 0:25:11| to develop the improvements that are shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1511)|
| 0:25:17| And there's another colored drawing in here that looks like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1517)|
| 0:25:24| And what that is it's it's Everett Road is basically make improvements to Everett Road from the interstate up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1524)|
| 0:25:32| Buttermilk Road also improvements to El Camino Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| some intersection improvements with traffic lights and then you can also see like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1537)|
| 0:25:43| What a blue line and an orange and yellow that represents water sewer and gas line improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1543)|
| 0:25:51| There's a breakdown of those cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| Also in here on on this chart it talks about the traffic improvements road improvements about 3.7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1554)|
| 0:26:02| the the water and sewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| 800,000 the gas 102| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| some utility relocations engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| And some issuance and capitalized interest cost that breaks that down now the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1571)|
| 0:26:17| the the water and sewer cost or at 50% of what those are and utility districts have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1577)|
| 0:26:23| You know offered to in enter it will enter into agreement with the developer to cover half of those costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1583)|
| 0:26:31| And then there's another about 3.3 million dollars that would be consumed over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| The life of the TIF it goes 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| for interest in carrying costs which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| Eligible under the TIF statute so that that's a breakdown of the project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1604)|
| 0:26:52| And I'd be happy to answer any other you know questions you may have about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| You know the the IDB's role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| Or anything they did and then there's the applicant is also here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| They could answer any more specific questions about the project itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| Okay, well, and this is more for general edification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1630)|
| 0:27:17| In terms of these utilities it's welcome all together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| Do we generally and this new kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| way of dealing with TIFs at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| State level and and only being for kind of general role use and not for you know that that that you talked with us about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1652)|
| 0:27:40| Do we usually enhance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| Utilities or has the state kind of spoken on what we're doing in utility enhancements as opposed to relocations or are these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1663)|
| 0:27:50| Simply relocations and not enhancements the majority of this or extend extensions and enhancements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1670)|
| 0:27:57| There's only a little bit of it this actually relocation and okay, so so a lot of this doesn't exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1677)|
| 0:28:03| Could you put a rough percentage on on it? We are we extending 50% of it 25%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1683)|
| 0:28:12| Well you got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| 900,000 versus 30 Sam so that means nothing that means absolutely nothing in terms of dollars, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1694)|
| 0:28:20| I mean, I want to know about how much land are we extending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| How much are we extending this if you understand my question Steve Maddox Everett Road Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1704)|
| 0:28:33| We are extending the water line is a it's approximately two miles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1713)|
| 0:28:39| And the reason we're extending it. There's there's only like a two-inch depends some area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1719)|
| 0:28:44| There's only like a two-inch line in another area. There's only like a four-inch line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| But if you remember in our first discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| We talked about there was no fire flow in that area so that they could have fire hydrants and hook up our trucks, too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1731)|
| 0:28:57| So we're we're increasing those lines to but that's like a minimum kind of yes, okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1737)|
| 0:29:03| And then the sewer line there's no sewer there now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1743)|
| 0:29:07| For this area where we're running the lines, and that's going to be approximately a mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1752)|
| 0:29:14| There's not any gas lines. There are gas lines right there to interstate, but they're not back anywhere on Everett Road anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| So we're extending those all this everything in yellow is pretty much new okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| Thank you yellow yellow is the gas yes, thanks mr.. Norman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| Thank you, mr.. Chairman mr.. Maddox. Yes, Todd, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1771)|

| 0:29:50| Whether the city pads have been in there for about a year a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| Maybe a year, maybe not quite a year. Okay. You perch you perch it when was your purchase of the property I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1794)|
| 0:30:04| Believe it was it we assembled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| Three separate tracks out there. I think the first one is like in oh four and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| Maybe one in oh five or oh six and then the other one in oh oh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| Six or oh seven something like that okay now. Do you you know it's hard to visualize this from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1817)|
| 0:30:24| you know on a flat piece of paper, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1824)|
| 0:30:27| I'm looking at this page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1831)|
| 0:30:33| That part what about half of that part that's outlined there would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| Half on one side of the hill and half on the other side of the hill so to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| Yes, that's that's pretty well correct if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| You see the L-shaped property that's I believe on the same map you're looking on if I've got the right one mm-hmm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1849)|
| 0:30:57| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1857)|
| 0:30:58| The light in the little gray line that runs across the property that would be about the top of the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1858)|
| 0:31:05| Okay, now. Do you own all the property outlined in green? Yes, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1865)|
| 0:31:11| Now have you done any excavation on the other side of the hill yet? Yes, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1871)|
| 0:31:17| And do you have any any buyers? Do you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| anybody that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| What's the interest level in terms of purchase the interest level is is good, and it's now getting better because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| the biggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| Complaint or problem that reason anybody's not hasn't moved forward mainly of the roads and the utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1893)|
| 0:31:40| Which this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| Which should satisfy this that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| Okay, thank you. Mr.. Briggs. Yes. This is I have a question for Todd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1906)|
| 0:31:55| I'm looking at the the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| TIF request summary on top here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| And we have the requested amount is six point one million and in the projected cost over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| Twenty years is nine point four, but the projected tax increments twenty three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1930)|
| 0:32:12| you know that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| You know I guess that's you know roughly a what is it a fourteen roughly a fourteen million dollar difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1934)|
| 0:32:22| Yeah, so a couple of things one of them is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| 60 per only 60% of the increment would actually go back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1948)|
| 0:32:33| To to the project it would be 40% it would stay with with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| And actually it's a little bit more than that because when you take out your debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1958)|
| 0:32:43| It gets down to about 50% so about 50% of the increment would go to pay the you know the cap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1963)|
| 0:32:51| Capital and interest on the on the project, and then the other half would go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| And I did want to point out one more thing that it's a little bit different that we've we've done in this TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1976)|
| 0:33:02| Is that we you know had some questions about the ability to get financing on this as well as the you know ability to get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1982)|
| 0:33:09| This project done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| So there's a couple of time limits that were put into this economic impact plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1990)|
| 0:33:15| Such that if we are not entered into a development and financing agreement means he has his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=1995)|
| 0:33:21| financing in place and agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| Entered into within three years, then the economic impact plan would go away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| Also, then if it was not of all the improvements were not complete within five years the economic impact plan would go away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| So I had meant to mention that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2016)|
| 0:33:39| And forgot to earlier you know I guess from our standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| It's it's the bottom line and this deals with property taxes what over 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2024)|
| 0:33:51| You know from the numbers that we have here could we project would be the county's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2031)|
| 0:33:58| The county's intake or the county's increment of that that we would have in cash that we wouldn't have if the project didn't go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2038)|
| 0:34:05| So and the tax based and the tax rate and the tax base stayed the same yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| Just the current tax rate on this property is about twenty eight thousand dollars a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2050)|
| 0:34:15| And so you know if you take out the the nine point four over the twenty years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| And if it develops as mr. Maddox says has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2061)|
| 0:34:26| Projected that it would then it's you know so you're somewhere around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| thirteen million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| to the good and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| You've got some new you know new roads to infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2074)|
| 0:34:38| Let me just make a comment on why I think we should support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| I know some people you know may feel and I think they have a legitimate concern because I've expressed some of these in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| Also about about giving help to this type of project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| And I think that one of the things that this project does it's a little bit different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| Even than the town center project this this is all road improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2097)|
| 0:35:01| This is all public improvement whether it makes better traffic for some of the people going to Oak Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| Or whether it it has to do with extending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| Sewer and water and fire surfaces out to part of the county that doesn't have now which is a positive benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2110)|
| 0:35:16| we've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| between 13 and 14 million dollars in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| property taxes that the county would have over the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2121)|
| 0:35:24| 20 years that we wouldn't have if we didn't have this project, and I think that's certainly a reason to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| I believe and I don't have them with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2129)|
| 0:35:31| But I believe the the numbers on the sale taxes once the project is completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2131)|
| 0:35:38| Was running in in and maybe someone could help me with those numbers. I believe it was what was it 1.8 million a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2138)|
| 0:35:47| I'm gonna defer to mr. Maddox right that's I didn't expect you to have that but it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2147)|
| 0:35:54| This was in I didn't bring those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| Or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| Maybe it was a maybe it's 1,200 jobs or 1,800 jobs. I may have my numbers confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2158)|
| 0:36:04| Maybe it's 12 million a year. What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| What was it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Now for the jobs or the sales tax the sales tax and the number of jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| the the total tax for the prop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| created by the project is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| 11.8 million. Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| Which approximately a million is this is the real estate taxes the the rest of its sales tax and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2184)|
| 0:36:31| Like liquor tax and things like that room tax. We're still talking about ten million dollars a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2191)|
| 0:36:38| Yes, sir net to the county. And then if you add that property tax in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| It's just a little bit under twelve million a year. That's correct. Yes, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| And and how many jobs I know these are retail jobs. What was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| It was and I don't I didn't bring that piece of information, but it's I want to say it's 1,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2211)|
| 0:36:59| 616 1,600. Yeah, 1,600. Yes, you know one of the reasons I want to speak for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| I know when we had this discussion a month or two ago when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2224)|
| 0:37:08| Voted to submit this to the IDP the IDB for their evaluation for the TIFF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2228)|
| 0:37:13| Is that there there was criticism that in the implication is is that retail jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2233)|
| 0:37:20| you know don't matter because you can't support a family of four on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| You know on minimum wage or nine dollars or ten dollars an hour and that may be true| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| But there's a lot of people who who need those jobs and and even if we start to have a better economy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2249)|
| 0:37:36| We still have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| Elderly people whose 401k plans have been hit really hard by the recession| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| That would very well like to have work part-time work or even full-time work in a retail type job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2263)|
| 0:37:49| Which you can do at that age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| That can supplement them in their income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| And if you think that people don't like those jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| You just can walk into Walmart and see the greeters there is that there's elderly people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| And I don't know if they're happy or not happy they usually seem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| They usually seem pretty glad to have a job when you go in and I think they're working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| Not just because they like that particular job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| But because they probably need the additional income and these retail type jobs do provide that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| We also just recently had a I believe it was a 12% increase in the tuition at the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| And we have students to whether they can continue their education or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2301)|
| 0:38:27| May depend upon whether they can either have part-time work during the off school hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| So they can have full-time work during the summer and there's even there's even some high school students that may want to work there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2311)|
| 0:38:37| So I don't think we need to assume that every time we create a retail job that there's something that's not good about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| Because there's a lot of benefit both to the elderly to the people that are between jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| That would like to have work and also students when they're looking at at tuition increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2328)|
| 0:38:54| And all you've got to do is look at see how much college costs these days to know that it's pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2334)|
| 0:38:58| Significant that would like to have those type of jobs in the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| And you know, we recently went through a very contentious budget process where there wasn't money for some projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2341)|
| 0:39:08| And I know we can argue this but I personally think that even the Beck Center was money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| Was money we really would have liked to have had for this and if we have if we have over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2352)|
| 0:39:20| over a million dollars a month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| More coming in if we had an extra twelve million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| This year for some of the community projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| We wouldn't have we wouldn't be having some of these these issues that we have right now and trying to fund all these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2369)|
| 0:39:36| So I think it's very important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| I do agree that it's not the the ID bees and the development corporation's jobs to really go out and recruit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2378)|
| 0:39:45| Retail type businesses because they're trying to recruit the better paying jobs with a lot of benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| But I think certainly when we have private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| individuals that are willing to put their money on the line and willing to put their skills to develop a project like this is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2393)|
| 0:40:00| The only thing that it's costing the county and I want to make it very clear these tiffs do not cost the county the tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2400)|
| 0:40:06| County not taxpayer anything if anything they relieve the burden of having potential tax increases in the in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2406)|
| 0:40:14| But I think that we should support these jobs when the only thing that it takes from the county and the County Commission is a vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| To allow it to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| Mr. Wright| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| Thank You mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| Thank you, dr. Briggs for trying to recruit me for a job, but it's too far for me to drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2426)|
| 0:40:32| From Hamlin, that's that's the problem. You live halfway to Morristown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| That's why I was going to say all the way from Hamlin County to get a job out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2436)|
| 0:40:41| I'm not speaking to this project up front. I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2441)|
| 0:40:45| Say that dr. Briggs and I attended a thing called a seminar called tiff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| 101 and every time we talk about a tiff I realize there's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| That had sort of escaped my attention as we've gone through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| The first thing that's really evident of what we're doing right now is this is the third time we're talking about that here in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2460)|
| 0:41:07| We preliminarily thought it to be a good idea a couple months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2467)|
| 0:41:12| Now the Industrial Development Board has fleshed that out with facts and figures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| About whether or not it will succeed and in their determination now. It's back before us for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2477)|
| 0:41:24| What I'll call final approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| The thing that I noticed most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| Significant as to what's happened for me in the last couple of months is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2492)|
| 0:41:37| We're not talking about 20 years down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| We're talking about next year next year's property taxes if this value of this property goes up a dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2499)|
| 0:41:47| next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| Then that is credited toward our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2509)|
| 0:41:56| Debt burden a hundred percent if the property value there doubles next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2516)|
| 0:42:03| then what portion of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| Property tax goes toward debt service. We will collect that from that new tax base and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2525)|
| 0:42:11| Not only that toward the debt service. We will also get 40% of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| the regular tax bill anyway, so the only thing that's left out of this tiff is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| The full faith and confidence of Knox County is used by this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| Developer to go to the bank and to borrow that's other 60%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2547)|
| 0:42:32| He's borrowing the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| The way I understand it. He's on the hook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| He's got to come up with the money. So as you've said, dr. Briggs, there there are no dollars leaving Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2559)|
| 0:42:48| To fund any work that's going on out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2568)|
| 0:42:50| And by the way next year if the property value goes up any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| Then we Knox County are getting some of our money back in real dollars from that tax from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2575)|
| 0:43:01| Property value increase and I think that's significant enough then for my other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| I'll vote for this tiff. Mr. Shouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| Thank you. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| Plan on supporting this tiff also and we we debated it too much three months ago and in the chamber group ID B's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2594)|
| 0:43:23| put it through the microscope and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| Recommended it and I'm sorry. I didn't get to the seminar that day. I the one that dr. Briggs and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2606)|
| 0:43:33| Mr. Wright others went to I had a conflict and maybe I wouldn't be asking this next question had I've been to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2613)|
| 0:43:39| And this could be a mammoth off question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2619)|
| 0:43:41| I don't know but I'll call him if you guys can't answer it the capitalized interest that makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2621)|
| 0:43:46| I'm just did a rough calculation six million at five percent. That's three hundred thousand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| six million or three hundred thousand added in a six point one and then another three and a half or three point three million of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2631)|
| 0:43:58| More carrying cost interest. Are you basically capitalizing interest for ten years beyond that? I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2638)|
| 0:44:05| Mean that runs it to nine me and enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| That's okay. Is that what's happening there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| This is Chris Trump. I'm counsel to the Industrial Development Board. And what what that's referring to is the you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2652)|
| 0:44:20| There's a this is a financing. So when six point one million dollars is borrowed over 20 years interest will be paid on that and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2660)|
| 0:44:29| The TIF revenues will go to pay that interest over time. So that's what that's referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| Okay, so the but the the actual bond from that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2676)|
| 0:44:42| First and see whoever I assume it'll be a bank probably want it. That'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2682)|
| 0:44:46| That'll fund this. I mean it's not going out publicly. Is it it probably a bike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2686)|
| 0:44:50| Normally, it is normally. I don't know what that will be six point. That'll be six million six point one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| So the only actual capitalization of interest is the three hundred thousand. Yeah, that's the capitalized interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| Yeah, which is which is including the six point one million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| So and so then the the three main carrying calls that's just another word for interest is yes, exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2704)|
| 0:45:10| Carrying cost interest that's just an accounting function that you put on here. All right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2710)|
| 0:45:15| It's just an estimated, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| How much interest is going to cost to borrow that money over 20 years and repay it the TIF revenues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2716)|
| 0:45:21| Okay, okay for that purpose and what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| Mr. Wright reference to the the interest interest the credit worthiness that the bank is looking at is not the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2725)|
| 0:45:32| It's to mr. Maddox and his company, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| The the what will happen is the TIF revenues we pledged to the whoever the finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2734)|
| 0:45:41| Company is whoever it is that finances the purchases the bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| Paid first out of the TIF revenues if there are no if there's not sufficient TIF revenues available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2747)|
| 0:45:52| It would be whoever is guaranteed that that debt which is the developer typically so it would be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| So that's just sort of a snapshot of a amortization schedule. I guess that additional three million. That's always what's just an estimated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2758)|
| 0:46:05| Yes. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| Mr. Norman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2767)|
| 0:46:10| Mr. Napier Todd, could I ask you another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2770)|
| 0:46:15| We is the MPC and how does the MPC involved as far as the land issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2775)|
| 0:46:21| Issues and slope considerations water all those types of things. Where are they in the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2781)|
| 0:46:28| I know this is a TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| Discussion, but in your analysis at IDB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2791)|
| 0:46:34| You've got involved these people in the viability of the project just given the piece of land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2794)|
| 0:46:39| Well, so the land is zoned appropriately to allow them to move forward with this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2799)|
| 0:46:46| and then the expectation is that they move forward with all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| Rules regulations that that are set forth in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| So, you know MPC is not directly involved in making a recommendation to the IDB on these projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2814)|
| 0:47:01| Okay, but you consult with these people that are experts in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| hydrology and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| Well these issues to I mean them. This is a piece of property that's in the middle of a ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2828)|
| 0:47:15| right and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2835)|
| 0:47:17| As far as I can tell you intend to excavate it completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2837)|
| 0:47:23| which implies there are some significant considerations from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| Hydrology standpoint. So when you have your hydro geo people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2847)|
| 0:47:33| Looking and making can this be done and how will it done and how can it be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2853)|
| 0:47:40| from an infrastructure standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| You know given where it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| We we do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| Give this thing a engineering review as to whether or not the hydrology or the design is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| We do a court cursory review to the level to make sure that the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| Infrastructure costs are in line with what's being asked and the reason you would do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2880)|
| 0:48:06| Is you want to make sure that they're you know, somebody's asking for ten million dollars worth of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| Increment to borrow it and you do your analysis say we you know, we've only got seven million dollars worth of work here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| It would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| Conceivable that you know some of that money could be shifted to non| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| TF supported infrastructure developments and you know kind of a cahoots or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| So we just want to make sure that the costs are in line with the projected work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2908)|
| 0:48:34| But you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2914)|
| 0:48:34| We cannot put ourselves in a position where we are making a determination on an engineering analysis of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2914)|
| 0:48:41| I mean that that's not our role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| Okay, then who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| Do you get consultanship with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Engineers out that way that will be the role of Knox County engineering and the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2928)|
| 0:48:55| to approve or disapprove of any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| Plans as they're developed and submitted. So there's none of there's no discussion of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2938)|
| 0:49:04| Parts at this time just in the financials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2944)|
| 0:49:07| That's that is our primary and you know, we also consult with County engineering in this particular case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2947)|
| 0:49:14| It would be also a city if it was in a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| But this case County engineering about you know, any concerns with the road and primarily whether there's a need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2956)|
| 0:49:23| Okay. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| Commissioner McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| Hey, mister, this question for you as well. So there's a a time limit five years on some so and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2970)|
| 0:49:38| I like that concept actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| Are we planning on making this a permanent fixture within the TIF process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2981)|
| 0:49:47| So we don't end up like we did at North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2987)|
| 0:49:49| I think that we you know that this is not in the policies and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2989)|
| 0:49:54| But it was it's discussed and I think that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| Something that should be considered and all been forwarding, you know, it's a good point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| You know, it was one of the things we learned from North Shore Town Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| I mean these things if they don't move forward at some point need to go away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3004)|
| 0:50:08| Okay. Yeah. Thanks. That's good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3008)|
| 0:50:12| Where is this property is in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| Is it in Farragut is it? No, it's it's in I want to make sure it's County outside the city limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3014)|
| 0:50:21| It's in the sixth district. Okay, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3021)|
| 0:50:27| You know that this is this is and I've spoken to this earlier in our conversations about the the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3027)|
| 0:50:36| Turkey Creek jr. Road in terms of this being something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3036)|
| 0:50:44| With this current configuration, you know, the previous owner I think did a very poor job and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3044)|
| 0:50:52| slope management and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| Probably chose a site that was less than adequate for a project whatever he or she had in mind that as it sits today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3054)|
| 0:51:03| Mr. Matlock if anyone, you know in this area could be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3063)|
| 0:51:10| Entitled to or definitely would be willing to I would be willing to consider a till for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| So I've moved a little as it relates to that, but there's a couple things. I guess I feel the need to comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3075)|
| 0:51:23| On and and the first is the the premise that these retail jobs are somehow a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3083)|
| 0:51:32| Boon or a great thing, you know, I guess what I heard was a it beats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3092)|
| 0:51:40| Nothing, and I agree with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3100)|
| 0:51:44| To a certain extent and and and that point being, you know location location location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| okay, if this was in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3110)|
| 0:51:51| another region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| I could see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| but with us just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| Potentially putting a period at the end of our elderly ridership program and we're not thinking about doing anything new and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3119)|
| 0:52:07| Creative with with respect to a cat. I don't see how the seniors are going to get out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3127)|
| 0:52:13| You know, there's not a direct line if they're that if they're struggling that much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3133)|
| 0:52:21| It'd be hard for them to have a car and pay four dollars a gallon for gas to come to far west Knotts County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3141)|
| 0:52:27| If we're talking about Knotts County residents, which I think we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3147)|
| 0:52:31| And not Loudon or Rome| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| or Anderson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| So, I I guess I do have a take a little bit of issue with these retail jobs being for these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3158)|
| 0:52:45| Seniors and a similar conversation with with with respect to students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3165)|
| 0:52:53| Again we're talking about a piece of property that is as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3173)|
| 0:52:58| West as we can get I mean, I don't care whether it's east west north or south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| I'm not getting into into direction, but this is a far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| County it'd be the same thing. It was in Corrington people would be looking at us trying to claim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| UT as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| Potential hiring base if it was it out in Corrington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3193)|
| 0:53:17| I think people would look at me like I was crazy trying to market a piece of property for student jobs, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3197)|
| 0:53:24| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| John severe south of John severe, so that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| That that argument, I don't think holds up in a in a in a real stress test| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3212)|
| 0:53:38| So, you know that concerns me. Is that are we building a facility that other folks are going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3218)|
| 0:53:46| going to utilize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| Are we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3229)|
| 0:53:51| potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3231)|
| 0:53:52| shifting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| To a point where we're not going to be able to support facilities like this with Knotts County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3234)|
| 0:54:01| Citizens and residents that need those jobs potentially so that that that piece of it concerns me and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3241)|
| 0:54:08| Then I guess you know in my last statement is is with respect to well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3248)|
| 0:54:14| It's going to be better than nothing. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| Think we're duty-bound to vet these tips. I mean, that's one of the things I really did appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3257)|
| 0:54:24| about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| Commissioner Pinkston former commissioner Pinkston is that you know, all of them were vetted whether they were good bad or or indifferent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3266)|
| 0:54:33| I think I think it went to through a sieve and a filtering process that that got the salient information out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3273)|
| 0:54:40| and so, you know, I know folks have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| Rolled their eyes and scolded and whatever me for asking these these questions as it relates to the to the TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3284)|
| 0:54:50| But I think it's good to get information out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3290)|
| 0:54:53| Even if you don't necessarily like the messenger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| it's good to get this information now and I think I've learned a lot more about this TIF than if we I would have if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3296)|
| 0:55:01| We would just come up here and rubber-stamped it and moved it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3301)|
| 0:55:04| so I make no apologies for for for asking the question at the previous meeting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3304)|
| 0:55:10| At subsequent meetings. I mean, I'm going to challenge these tips again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3310)|
| 0:55:13| This is one that I really think I can get my arms around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3313)|
| 0:55:16| But I don't if I if we didn't get all this information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| I don't think I would be in a position to do that. So thank you for indulging me. Mr. Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3320)|
| 0:55:26| Thank You. Mr. Chairman good points there Sam. Mr. Maddox quick question for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3326)|
| 0:55:32| On this tip you've got a 20-year tip and this isn't your first rodeo and I've seen the work that you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3332)|
| 0:55:38| You do first-class work. And what do you think?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3338)|
| 0:55:41| Realistically, when do you think you'll have it paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| He would could you have it paid in 13 18 or do you think you're going to need the full 20? Well, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3344)|
| 0:55:51| If you when you look back on the like the projected build-out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| three or four years ago before we hit this recession and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3355)|
| 0:55:59| Comparing it to like Turkey Creek. This project would have built out in three three years and six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3359)|
| 0:56:06| that we then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| started running our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3368)|
| 0:56:09| projections on five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3369)|
| 0:56:11| Now because of the recessions gone longer and is deepened and then for the purpose of the tip we ran it out on ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3371)|

| 0:56:29| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3389)|
| 0:56:29| I think that's important to let people know that it may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| Little bit of a little bit of play room there. Okay, and then question for Todd if you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3393)|
| 0:56:41| I'll just know what he's saying there. I know Commissioner Norman and especially Commissioner Hammond, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3401)|
| 0:56:47| We've looked at these tests before it used to be they would be 10 years 15 now we're looking at 20 and most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3407)|
| 0:56:53| construction things go 10, maybe 15 year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| length of terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| If you could take this just my personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| Feeling thought if you take back to the IDB board just let them know if we can cut these down a little bit longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3421)|
| 0:57:06| In time, I know it's better for the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3426)|
| 0:57:08| They get a longer more security and get lower rates that they're actually going to have to be paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3433)|
| 0:57:14| I'd like to see us get back if we could to you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| Used to be I would give a 10-year then all of a sudden we went to a 15 now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| We're looking at 20. So if we can if you if you guys can keep that in mind, sir, mr. Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3440)|
| 0:57:27| Thank You, mr. Chairman, just one quick comment. No questions Todd just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| Commissioner McKenzie mentioned the fact about somebody driving from court and down there to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3451)|
| 0:57:37| We don't need to be thinking so much about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3457)|
| 0:57:39| Those driving down there to work we need to thinking about what those that work there where they're going to spend the money and what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3459)|
| 0:57:46| The biggest chances where they're going to spend it's going to be here in Knox County, and I think that's the bottom line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| Mr. Briggs, yeah, I just I agree a lot with what Sam said about this and I think we do need to question these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| But the one thing I'd want to point out because there's the the implication that this is way out in the middle of nowhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3478)|
| 0:58:05| I believe I read someplace today where the population center of Knox County is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3485)|
| 0:58:11| somewhere between Cedar Bluff and Lovell Road and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| So actually if we built this thing right in downtown, Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3494)|
| 0:58:18| We'd be further away from the population center than if we built it out west| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| Because that's where the people I think the reason it's being built out west. That's where the people live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3501)|
| 0:58:28| Like to make a comment to that we talk a lot about what happens when the development is finished I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3508)|
| 0:58:34| toured the marketplace down at outlets mall just last week and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3514)|
| 0:58:39| Somebody has to build these facilities. Somebody has to put in the plumbing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| Somebody has to put in the electrical work. Somebody has to put in the field lines and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| They were telling me that they had spent over 1 million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| Just to put in electrical and plumbing work and this is at the marketplace there on outlets Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| Those are not $8 an hour jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| If you've hired a plumber lately or if you've had somebody come to your house or if you've done electrician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| You know that those are good paying jobs and this is work that is being provided by that one project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| So think of the work that is going to do to develop and to build these projects before it's even completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3545)|
| 0:59:12| We see an economic impact and a trickle-down effect from that as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| The motion on the floor is to approve all those in favor. Say aye aye any opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3556)|
| 0:59:21| motion passes next item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| The next item is number 27 resolution 903| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| It's placing employees of the Knox County Commission under the general Knox County employee handbook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3567)|
| 0:59:33| Commissioners, I'd like to ask that you pass this on without recommendation at the chairman's lunch on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| I intend to address this with miss Fogerson plus allow our employees any opportunity to address us about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3578)|
| 0:59:43| So if you would indulge me to pass this on without recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3583)|
| 0:59:47| I would entertain that motion second all those in favor say aye aye motion passes next item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3587)|
| 0:59:54| Page 7 item number 28 resolution 904| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3594)|
| 0:59:58| It's requesting that the Metropolitan Planning Commission study and recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3598)|
| 1:00:02| amendments to the Knox County zoning ordinance to provide for the raising and maintenance of domesticated chickens and certain parts of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3602)|
| 1:00:09| unincorporated Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3611)|
| 1:00:13| Move to approve there a second. Okay question. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| Since when has it been against the law to have chickens in Knox County commissioner Briggs you want to address your ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3618)|
| 1:00:23| We don't see any of the people from the MPC down here. But my understanding is is that for areas that are zoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3623)|
| 1:00:31| low density residential is that you're prohibited from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| having livestock on the premises and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| Since I have the floor right now, do you want to ask another question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| Since you were right. Yeah, what I was going to say is what we're doing with this resolution right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| We're not asking to really get into the debate about whether it's good or bad as some of you know, the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3648)|
| 1:00:55| passed a resolution that allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| Chickens with with with a lot of conditions put on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| There's a limit to the number of chickens that they can have there can be no roosters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| And I believe it was even done under a one-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| sort of like a pilot project where they'll come back and revisit that to see if there's any problems see what type of complaints have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| come up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| The question is is if and the reason this really came up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3677)|
| 1:01:21| I had several people contact me that said if you can have chickens in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| Why can't we have chickens in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| And this just allows the Metropolitan Planning Commission to tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| What they know at this point right now because it has not been a year yet since that resolution was passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3690)|
| 1:01:36| Let them come back to us and then we can decide if we want to do that or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| Hmm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| What's only six hens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| Yeah, it's just six chickens and and the law director just reminded me that this is a non-commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| I don't know if you can make too much out of a business out of four hens or six hens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3709)|
| 1:01:54| But but it has to be a you know, it's a non-commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| Well, if we're going to look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3717)|
| 1:02:00| Maybe we need to look at not only chickens, but not an instance here a couple of months ago where that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3720)|
| 1:02:08| a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3728)|
| 1:02:09| Couple living in the subdivision had a pet goat. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| Mean it stayed in the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| Neighbors complained and I mean, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| It's a clean goat. They are some wasn't a Billy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| So, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3742)|
| 1:02:23| maybe this I would I would prefer not to have an amendment on this because this is really just trying to bring us in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3743)|
| 1:02:28| with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3748)|
| 1:02:29| with the cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3749)|
| 1:02:31| You know with the cities. I'm just saying maybe we need to look at the whole thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| Well, well we can but I think I would do that separately because just about I mean you could say what about a cow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3755)|
| 1:02:40| What about one of those little?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| Jap not Japanese pig Vietnamese pigs or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| They are those little potbelly and I'd prefer right now just to keep it just chickens because that's the only thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3764)|
| 1:02:50| That's been approved in the city of Knoxville. We do have we will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3770)|
| 1:02:55| some experience to draw on since they've had that now for four or five months and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| You know if we want to look at some other animals, I think that's I think later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| I think that's fine. But right now I'd like to just keep it where we are and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| And do any of those others separately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3790)|
| 1:03:13| Mr. Wright, thank you. Mr. Chairman and thank you. Dr. Briggs for bringing pointing this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3793)|
| 1:03:20| and I do want to just limit our discussion to chickens, I think but I noticed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3800)|
| 1:03:26| Metropolitan Planning Commission people over and they're right next to the exit trying to get out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3806)|
| 1:03:31| the I didn't see you back there. Sorry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| the one thing that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| I'd like for them to also consider is the fact that in Knox County. There are lots of locations where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3817)|
| 1:03:44| There is no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| sanitary sewer so the lowest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| Housing density is one acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3829)|
| 1:03:52| One acre can be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| We're going to start trying to split things the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3838)|
| 1:04:02| Subdivisions that have one acre lots could currently be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| zoned residential and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3847)|
| 1:04:09| What I would like to see something in this to try to consider the fact that that you not down zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3849)|
| 1:04:15| If you want to look at that way from residential one acre lots and one acre subdivisions to one acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3855)|
| 1:04:23| Agricultural so you could then let chickens run around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3863)|
| 1:04:28| subdivision, so I'm looking at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3868)|
| 1:04:31| MPC guys right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| That's something I think needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3874)|
| 1:04:37| Looked at as we try to figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3877)|
| 1:04:40| How many chickens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| How they're going to be contained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| What's the difference between the AG zone and residential zone because a lot of the East County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3883)|
| 1:04:49| That's the smallest lot is an acre and it can be one of two zones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3889)|
| 1:04:53| It could be my understanding is if you're zoned agriculture there are no restrictions now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| But that's what I'm getting at so you could be zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| residential in a one acre lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| subdivision and you could down zone would to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3904)|
| 1:05:07| Agricultural would you then be allowed to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| Let chickens run all over the place, and I believe there's a way around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| What we're trying to accomplish that we I just don't want to be an unintended consequence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| Think they could they could apply to be down zoned, but I don't think that would pass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3921)|
| 1:05:27| Mr.. Donaldson, you'd like to address us on this name and address of the record please or not to mark Donaldson with the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3927)|
| 1:05:33| in fact we have just recently had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| request at the Planning Commission to down zone their property from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3936)|
| 1:05:41| Our a zoning to agricultural zoning for the purpose of keeping chickens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3941)|
| 1:05:47| So that's the timing is of this request is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| particularly given the city's recent experience, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| We'll take a look at everything that we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| look at the definitions that are in the zoning code and the various terms that are used and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3958)|
| 1:06:04| Make a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3964)|
| 1:06:05| What was what was the what happened on that down zone is that the one on Griffith Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3965)|
| 1:06:10| And halls it's out in your area that sounds right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3970)|

| 1:06:34| It's just a resolution to send it to the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| For study that come this this is more for the public out there to study, and then we'll come back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| I'm sure we'll have input from people that are for and against this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4003)|
| 1:06:48| We don't have to invent the wheel here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| We really a lot of the works already been done by the city and the in the Planning Commission's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| Probably already heard of a lot of the arguments for and against this so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| This is just to send it to them and let them come back with a report to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| And mr.. Chairman if I could then follow up with an unrelated issue. I believe it's coming before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4023)|
| 1:07:10| City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| or other ordinances related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4032)|
| 1:07:15| Pets and animals and chickens and maybe as Commissioner Brown has noted goats I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4035)|
| 1:07:25| Believe City Council is going to think about how dogs are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4045)|
| 1:07:32| Restrained and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| Based on what they talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4054)|
| 1:07:39| How you would humanely treat our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| Our animal dog friends I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4066)|
| 1:07:47| follow along behind that for something that would look the same in the county because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4067)|
| 1:07:53| Just as someone's wanting to keep chickens, and we're going to discuss that I believe there's also these other discussions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4073)|
| 1:08:00| Other four-legged animals that may follow along behind that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4080)|
| 1:08:05| Motion on the floor is to approve all those in favor say aye aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| The opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4088)|

| 1:08:26| 2005 to present is there a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4106)|
| 1:08:30| Second motion made and seconded any discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| Yes Commissioner McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4115)|
| 1:08:38| I guess I wanted someone to to clearly define| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4118)|
| 1:08:43| Forensic audit just so I would know I don't know I guess mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4123)|
| 1:08:47| Walls behind me may be able to better define it than myself a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4127)|
| 1:08:54| Forensic audit would be a little bit deeper than your normal audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4134)|
| 1:09:02| Okay, what does that mean in terms of time money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4142)|
| 1:09:09| We talk about a factor of four in terms of cost a factor of two or twenty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4149)|
| 1:09:15| No, I don't I don't think it would be any you know anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| To that extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4159)|
| 1:09:21| You know maybe another 10% 15% in that neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| Okay, well because I guess when I'm in terms of we're gonna look at day-to-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4166)|
| 1:09:32| Utility bills are we gonna look at corporate cleaning costs, you know corporate how deep does this go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4172)|
| 1:09:40| I guess is my is my question at this point. I haven't been asked to do it. So so I haven't done any planning or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4180)|
| 1:09:48| You know anything of that nature when you know once we are asked to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| That's that's when we would make those decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| And and we go about if this will probably help you some we go about our planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| based on risk and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4200)|
| 1:10:03| So what you know, we will look at each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4203)|
| 1:10:06| Transaction area identify the risk and those are the areas we'll concentrate on. Okay, so so this would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4206)|
| 1:10:13| Be a risk base and there'll be a cutoff to where we're not going to fool with that because it poses a little risk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4213)|
| 1:10:20| Whomever that that's correct. Okay. Thank you. Mr. One of the things I hope to do and I asked our law director to contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| Mr. Carcelo is to come to our luncheon on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4226)|
| 1:10:29| we have three items on the agenda with regards to audits so he could come and we could have this discussion as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| the differences between the audits how in-depth that type of thing not to say that oh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4235)|
| 1:10:41| And I'm in favor of doing this by the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| But I think it would be helpful for us to talk with him about the audits that we have on the on the books| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| Just to kind of get his input because he's the expert and he could answer any of those types and it's as well as mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4247)|
| 1:10:53| Walls, he would be there as well. So I intend to ask him to come to lunch. All right. Yes, Commissioner Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4253)|
| 1:10:57| Yeah, this is I guess just a procedural question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| You know, I see that, you know, Jeff is the sponsor of this one and Jeff is the sponsor of that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4262)|
| 1:11:07| I thought that what we were going to do rather than then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4267)|
| 1:11:10| Commissioners requesting audits or the are the even the Commission itself requests an audience penny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4270)|
| 1:11:15| I thought we were going to run that through the Audit Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4275)|
| 1:11:18| And then come back with their recommendations is this to refer it to the Audit Committee to understanding it is yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4278)|
| 1:11:24| He's referring it to the Audit Committee. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4284)|
| 1:11:27| Okay, good. I just want to be sure that I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| Because I think that some of those same questions because I think it's a very good question that Sam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4289)|
| 1:11:34| That Sam asked because I would have had some of the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| Some of the same questions asked about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| But if it goes through the Audit Committee, then probably a lot of those can be answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| Just what you know, what are they going to look for and how and how deep are they going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| Commissioner on me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| Yes, um, the reason I did this is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4310)|
| 1:11:55| not that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| Say there's anything going wrong that PBA is not managing their books properly. They're not spending the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4317)|
| 1:12:04| citizens money properly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4324)|
| 1:12:05| It's the citizens want to make sure because the perception and I know a lot of people don't like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4325)|
| 1:12:12| Perception can be perceived a lot of ways the perception in the public is is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4332)|
| 1:12:18| There is a lot of misuse and this will set that either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| Fact base or it's going to say. No, there's not everything's been running smooth and they haven't been wasting money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4342)|
| 1:12:28| So that's the reason I brought this forward. It's not to to cast any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4348)|
| 1:12:35| Fault or guilt on anybody before we've even looked at the book| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| So that's the only reason I'm bringing this forward. So I just want to set that straight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| The emotion on the floor is to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| Pardon me a commissioner, right? I'm sorry. Thank you. Mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4365)|
| 1:12:47| Chairman the I think what we've heard from the other side is what I wanted to make sure that we had an understanding of and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4367)|
| 1:12:55| Also to develop a little bit more discussion around it. This is a request by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| Commission to the Audit Committee to go do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4381)|
| 1:13:05| If Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| prefers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| I'm a member of the Audit Committee if you want to know what our action will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4389)|
| 1:13:14| This is for discussion come next Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| I want it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4397)|
| 1:13:18| I want you all to rest assured if you want us to come back and say what we're going to do before we do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4398)|
| 1:13:22| We can do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| Can we yeah?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| Another Audit Committee member sitting just down the aisle here from me. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4406)|
| 1:13:30| As this is discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| We need to know exactly what the feel of Commission is and what Commission wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4412)|
| 1:13:38| because that's what the Audit Committee is going to go do and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4418)|
| 1:13:45| It's as dr. Briggs said in a couple of sentences there the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4425)|
| 1:13:50| County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| Auditor works at the direction of the Audit Committee and the Audit Committee works. It's a direction of Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4433)|
| 1:14:01| Point of I guess order or clarification then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| Should we send this on without recommendation because if we pass it unanimously today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4445)|
| 1:14:10| Sounds like everyone's in support of it. Then we have to pull it off of the consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4450)|
| 1:14:14| So either way if it's passed without recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| Then we're going to talk about it Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| If not, we'll have to pull it off consent because I think our rules say if it passes unanimously would go on without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4459)|
| 1:14:26| It will and anybody can pull it off that wants to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4466)|
| 1:14:29| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| Doesn't matter. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| Depending on our conversation. Mr. Carcello| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| Somebody may want to pull it off and have more further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| But I think it'd be helpful for us to have that discussion on Monday with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| The motion on the floor is to approve all those in favor. Say aye aye any opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4480)|
| 1:14:45| It passes next item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| 30 resolution 906| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| It's requesting that the Knox County Audit Committee direct the Knox County Internal Auditor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4489)|
| 1:14:54| To conduct a forensic audit of the financial aspects that led to the construction of the Hardin Valley Academy. Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4494)|
| 1:15:02| No, no, is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| Commissioner want me I'd like to actually make an amendment to my own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| Resolution to add one sentence to the end of it. It says as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4510)|
| 1:15:14| Well as the management of the project through completion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4514)|
| 1:15:20| So if I could make that resolution or that amendment to the resolution as the maker of the motion that's fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4520)|
| 1:15:27| Commissioner McKenzie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| in that same vein could I add another I'd ask the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4529)|
| 1:15:34| make of the motion for another friendly amendment and that would be to include the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| Knox County School Board personnel representatives in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4539)|
| 1:15:44| process and say they had a integral part of it of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4544)|
| 1:15:49| Stops and starts and additions and all that other thing. All that was kind of went through their board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4549)|
| 1:15:55| they're going to do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| Finan a forensic audit of the financial aspects that led to the construction then it has to include them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4557)|
| 1:16:03| I mean, it's got to include everybody who was involved. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4563)|
| 1:16:06| Don't think that had to be named separately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| well, I mean that that's that that's a good point, but I didn't know if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4568)|
| 1:16:14| The financial part of it was handled by Knox County School Board personnel Doug Dillingham and all of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4574)|
| 1:16:21| There was a political aspect to it too that I do think needs to be included in the conversation in these vetting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4581)|
| 1:16:28| So that that's that's what I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| someone to bring the that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| School board political piece of it to the table and to discuss that as well so we can get a full picture of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4593)|
| 1:16:40| How Hardin Valley was built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| It's my only point so that that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| I'd ask that I don't think it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| Cause any more pain or suffering from from the audit process if that was done. I just think it would be a more complete audit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4608)|
| 1:16:55| You have any issues with that? I have a problem with you in a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| Okay, all those in favor say aye any opposition motion passes next item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4617)|
| 1:17:04| Number 13 31 resolution 907 is requesting that the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4624)|
| 1:17:10| Requesting that the county mayor investigate whether Knox County's community warning system should include emergency sirens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4630)|
| 1:17:17| Designed to alert the citizens of Knox County of impending severe weather. Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4637)|
| 1:17:24| Is there a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| Basically, this is a study just similar to the chickens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4647)|
| 1:17:34| We're just asking them to take a look at it and report back to us the mayor's office has agreed to do this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| So we'll take a look at it several communities are looking at this now the city of Sweetwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4659)|
| 1:17:43| For example the city of Sparta city of Kingsport, Middlesbrough, Kentucky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4663)|
| 1:17:47| The technology has advanced to the point where a lot of communities are starting to look at this and I think that it's something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4667)|
| 1:17:52| We should look at so I appreciate the motion and second all those in favor say aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| Any opposition motion? Oh, mr. Brown. I just like to make one comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4676)|
| 1:18:03| Out where I live you've got a siren downtown, I'm not going to hear it over Browns Mountain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4683)|
| 1:18:09| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| everybody's either got the TV on or the radio on with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4694)|
| 1:18:15| Capabilities we have through e911 now and the contacts that they can make there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| Those can be on every radio and TV station within 30 seconds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4701)|
| 1:18:26| So I just like to put that in the mix to be considered instead of going around putting up sirens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4706)|
| 1:18:32| Downtown that I can't hear out my house. Thank you. Well, this would be for all of Knox County wouldn't just be for downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4712)|
| 1:18:38| But anyway, this would be something to take a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| Once again the vote all those in favor say aye aye any opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4721)|

| 1:19:06| Are you ready to talk about that this month or is it something that needs to be deferred again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4746)|
| 1:19:11| I'm ready to talk about it. I think Commissioner Broyles has had some problems with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4751)|
| 1:19:16| And I hope those problems have been answered. It's the so-called hotline and it's up and running and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4756)|
| 1:19:23| people can call in and are calling in with fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4763)|
| 1:19:27| So I'll make a motion though that it be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4767)|
| 1:19:31| Sent on no recommendation so that Commissioner Broyles have the opportunity to talk next Monday or a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4771)|

| 1:19:47| constant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4787)|

| 1:20:20| I'd like to have a more of a discussion on this about how this would take place on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| So I'm asking this to be sent on without a recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| I'll move second Commissioner McKenzie. I just see mr. Cohen in the house. I didn't know if you wanted to speak to the matter at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4827)|

| 1:20:56| And then we will bring it up again in our meeting on Monday during our regular session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| But the luncheon is just a conversation piece with mr. Carcelo who's head of our audit committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| it might be appropriate also if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| Someone from Beck would have the opportunity to talk either with you or with someone you designate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4868)|

| 1:21:53| He is not really the head of anything he's just another opinion, but he is an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4913)|

| 1:22:54| Develop and and perform an audit and what hoops we have to jump through in order to get someone to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=4974)|

| 1:24:23| Maybe something that the schools to look at and my question is has that been done because I'm not even sure I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5063)|
| 1:24:28| I mean, you know, I want to see what the is this something that's done routinely has the schools looked at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5068)|
| 1:24:33| It's you know, it's basically an easement through one of the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5073)|

| 1:24:46| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5086)|
| 1:24:47| The law director stepped out right now, but has he looked at is this something that we that we want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5087)|
| 1:24:53| First of all, I need a motion to take it off consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5093)|

| 1:25:07| Into the interested parties in particular. I think it needs to be looked at by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5107)|
| 1:25:11| You know by the by the school since it involves them and may need to be looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5111)|

| 1:25:23| We may not have any choice because I think these utilities can can get these easements when they want it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5123)|
| 1:25:28| It may just be a formality, but I want to be certain that that's the case before we sign off on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5128)|

| 1:28:22| On the sale of these parcels Dwight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5302)|
| 1:28:27| I'm familiar with the site where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| mulching facility was and visited it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| The parcels though, I'm not familiar with the parcels in the parcel numbers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5314)|
| 1:28:40| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5320)|
| 1:28:41| Are all of these parcels were they all used for mulch mulching process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5321)|
| 1:28:48| Commissioner without the benefit of the map in front of them a little reluctant to commit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| They are all contiguous and one is a small stray parcel. It's tiny and entirely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| contained within one of the two larger parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| Of course, you know, there's the pad on top the 23 acre site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5342)|
| 1:29:07| That's on top and that's where all the activity takes place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| But I don't know if the lot lines bisect that 23 acres or not quite frankly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5349)|
| 1:29:16| if somebody from purchasing or mr. King may know that but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5356)|
| 1:29:20| Without the maps in front of me. I'd be speculating and I'm reluctant to do that. Okay. Do you what was the total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5360)|
| 1:29:27| acreage involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| 159 159| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| Okay, mr. King, I guess some questions for you then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5371)|
| 1:29:36| so the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| 130| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5378)|
| 1:29:41| 136 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| can you characterize the other 136 I guess which none of it was used for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5383)|
| 1:29:50| mulch processing, right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| You have it's hard to answer with that without the map in front of you. There are two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5392)|
| 1:29:59| Larger parcels one of those parcels was over 100 acres once 40 something acre they combined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5399)|
| 1:30:05| Then there was a small| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| Roughly two and a half acre triangular shaped piece of property that if you will insert it into the boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5408)|
| 1:30:16| at one point of one of these larger lots and they bought that little parcel and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| Evened up the boundary if you will or straighten out the boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| currently the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5425)|
| 1:30:27| A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5427)|
| 1:30:28| Probably a what you would describe as the major portion of the current activity on-site is on one of the larger sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5428)|
| 1:30:36| However, there are two detention ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| One of those detention ponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| I know for sure one of them is partly on one parcel and partly on the other parcel the access road into the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5441)|
| 1:30:49| Crosses through one parcel on to the other parcel, etc| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| And but you know in the biggest parcel hundred and roughly 111 acres there's part of it that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5454)|
| 1:31:03| Currently being used for any kind of mulching activity or anything like that on. Okay. Do we have any does the county have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5463)|
| 1:31:11| Financial liability as regards the detention ponds. Yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| Okay, and what would that financial liability be a potential liability would relate to environmental issues with the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5475)|
| 1:31:23| okay, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| How do you determine what that I mean, I think they're you know, they do a check. I know right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5485)|
| 1:31:33| They started to work on on those on those ponds getting them cleaned out and whatever repairs needed and the second either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5493)|
| 1:31:41| I know they've had various checks by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5501)|
| 1:31:43| I don't think there's any current problems that have been identified at all with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| With anything on site as far as the state is concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| and that would be the only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| Potential liability that I would think of so within the agreement. There is there is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5515)|
| 1:32:02| portion of that agreement that says that we are liable for whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| Repairs or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| To meet standards by TDAC, whatever they come in and find is that some something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5530)|
| 1:32:15| I don't know that that's part of the agreement. Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5535)|
| 1:32:19| Mr. Vanderbilt deal with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| But I mean that that arises more as a matter of law than anything else since they were the permit holder on the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5541)|
| 1:32:29| Oh, okay. Okay. Don't go away. Mr. King| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5549)|
| 1:32:33| Mr. Norman if I can clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5553)|
| 1:32:35| And mr. King is correct. It's it's more a matter of law than it is a matter of the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5555)|
| 1:32:39| TDAC has stipulated that that is a regulated material the sediment in the ponds is a regulated material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5559)|
| 1:32:45| It is regulated because it dates to the period of time when the facility operated as a composting facility and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5565)|
| 1:32:52| That obviously is held to a higher and different standard than it would be if these were ponds that were exclusively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5572)|
| 1:32:57| Operated when it was a mulching facility TDAC has instructed us that that is Knox County sediment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5577)|
| 1:33:03| We're responsible for it and we cannot convey the liability for that settlement or the responsibility for that sediment with the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5583)|
| 1:33:10| We've got personnel have been out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| This week and last week beginning the cleanup process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| The material actually just goes to a commercial landfill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5596)|
| 1:33:20| And then we've consulted with the liner company because we will damage the liner in the course of getting the sediment removed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5600)|
| 1:33:27| But it is our intent to have the sediment excavated and the ponds cleaned and cleared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5607)|
| 1:33:33| before the property conveys to NRRT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5613)|
| 1:33:36| also the original estimate I believe was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| 158 plus 159 acres and the two acres that I mentioned that small out parcel tipped the scales over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5619)|
| 1:33:47| 160 and I'll have you an exact figure. I've got all of that in my file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| I just didn't happen to bring it with me for purposes of this discussion today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| But it's actually slightly over 160 acres with the three parcels is part of the is one of the parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5634)|
| 1:34:00| I mean does the parcel slope down to the river on the backside it adjoins the river, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5640)|
| 1:34:07| Indirectly it is extremely steep. The backside is extremely steep. There's a little confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5647)|
| 1:34:11| It says lakefront, but there's a railroad that runs along the bottom of that side by the water Knox County's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5651)|
| 1:34:18| It seemed to be NRRT's property gives way to a railroad easement. I think strictly speaking. It is not waterfront property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5658)|
| 1:34:25| Okay, there's no park. There's no wreck parks and wreck land that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5665)|
| 1:34:31| contiguous with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5671)|

| 1:36:43| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| This is as a result of what we passed recently with Commissioner Kingston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| Some other commissioners had received a bill I think four hundred and seventy five dollars and so we were looking at a policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5810)|

| 1:39:05| well again, I was asked to do this be very for the very reason that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5945)|
| 1:39:10| previous commissioners had contacted the Commission and so they wanted to be and reimbursed for a caught cost and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5950)|
| 1:39:17| Likewise a commissioner who wanted to be reimbursed for an ethics violation that turned out to be specious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5957)|
| 1:39:23| So it's really it's the will of the Commission how you want this. I was just drafting in terms of what I was advised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5963)|
| 1:39:29| Was your intent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5969)|
| 1:39:30| Mr. Smith, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5970)|
| 1:39:32| Want to recuse from that because I am one of the commissioners that you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5972)|
| 1:39:35| I was found innocent and I thought it was taken care of months and months ago when it hadn't so and I think this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| Commissioner Hammonds come by and try to correct this so I'm gonna recuse from it. Mr. Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5980)|
| 1:39:46| You know, I I think that's a good point that Mike makes on this about looking back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5986)|
| 1:39:51| it's not that we shouldn't look back because some of these things are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5991)|
| 1:39:55| You know, we're almost harassment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5995)|
| 1:39:57| accusations that have been against commissioners and you were you know, I know during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=5997)|
| 1:40:02| You know back during the Black Wednesday deal, you know a lot of people got or Black Friday, whatever it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6002)|
| 1:40:08| But a lot of people got involved with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6008)|
| 1:40:10| but I think that what we should do is is we really should look at this going forward and then on a case-by-case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6010)|
| 1:40:17| basis if people want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6017)|
| 1:40:19| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| Make application for their fees because some of these may very well be deserved, but we may have things coming back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6020)|
| 1:40:26| From a long long time ago that could be very large, but it wouldn't be automatically paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| No, that's what I'm saying is if we and then but the people could still make applications just like Paul Pinkston did you know for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6031)|
| 1:40:36| a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6036)|
| 1:40:38| And I you know, I think those that have merit will be supported by this Commission because we understand a lot of you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6038)|
| 1:40:45| What goes on with this? And so I would support if you want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| You know an amendment to that. I would be glad to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| Second that you know second that if that needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6052)|
| 1:40:57| worded, mr. Law director that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6057)|
| 1:40:59| Yeah from the date of passage which will be a date of passage and take two to two readings to pass and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6059)|
| 1:41:06| any previous cases would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| Strictly at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| They could be yeah, they could just make a vision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| They could be submitted in and we look at those on a case-by-case basis just like we did with Paul Pinkston simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6074)|
| 1:41:21| I'll take care of it. Thank you. All right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| This first and second agree to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6085)|
| 1:41:28| So, so, mr. Chairman, where does this leave us with things that have happened in the past when when a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6088)|
| 1:41:35| What this was being developed for was to cover those occurrences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6095)|
| 1:41:42| Where in an official capacity a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6102)|
| 1:41:46| Person had been exonerated of the charges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6106)|
| 1:41:49| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6109)|
| 1:41:50| Where are we now? Do those individuals have to come one at a time still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6110)|
| 1:41:55| According to what the verbiage that we would include it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6115)|
| 1:41:58| Yes, this would go forward from passage, but anyone previous would need to make application to Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6118)|
| 1:42:04| Okay, but so so what we're so what what we're doing then is in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6124)|
| 1:42:10| We're going to say those that have that act in an official capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6130)|
| 1:42:15| They're taken to task and exonerated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6135)|
| 1:42:20| then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| Their expenses are going to be paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| Mm-hmm, but we turn around and say but because of this action today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6145)|
| 1:42:30| We're not covering those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6150)|
| 1:42:32| expenses in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| suits where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| you have acted in your official capacity and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6156)|
| 1:42:39| been exonerated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| We're not going to pay unless you come forward. That's what I'm trying to get at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6161)|
| 1:42:46| That's only as it should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| I mean, I think they need to be any previous thing needs to be taken on a case-by-case basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6168)|
| 1:42:53| We could have I mean, you know, theoretically you could have something that happened 30 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6173)|
| 1:42:57| It could have been I mean, you know, I just hate having an unlimited cap on size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6177)|
| 1:43:02| We don't know what's I mean quite frankly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| We don't know what's out there and there may have been something that had a fifty or sixty thousand dollar fee, you know back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6184)|
| 1:43:11| 1976 but if it meets our qualifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| Going forward then we ought to meet it in qualifications going backwards. Well, I think I need to well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6194)|
| 1:43:19| I think I think you have to look at what the whole situation was and I mean, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6199)|
| 1:43:23| I know people say this things change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6203)|
| 1:43:26| But but you know if there is something and and I think I mean I personally think that just like we did with Paul| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6206)|
| 1:43:32| Pinkston is if someone comes here and we know about the case and we hear the situation that it'll be approved without a whole lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6212)|
| 1:43:38| of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6218)|
| 1:43:42| So the motion on the floor Oh did the first and second agree to the idea to the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6222)|
| 1:43:47| Who was the first and second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6227)|
| 1:43:52| On B and McKenzie, did you all agree to the yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| Yes. Okay motion on the floor is to approve all those in favor. Say aye. Aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6236)|
| 1:44:00| Any opposition? I'm sorry. Mr. Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6240)|
| 1:44:04| Yes, we're we finish well, mr| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| Law director then do I need to resubmit because I've already submitted to you once you have everything that you need from me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| Well, the Commission has to make that decision if the Commission is satisfied with the documentation then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6251)|
| 1:44:18| You make that decision once this passes. I would have to wait to Monday, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6258)|
| 1:44:22| Yeah| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6262)|
| 1:44:23| I mean I what I would suggest doing is just going ahead and making you know making application to the Commission on this and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6263)|
| 1:44:29| You know, they've had it for months. So I just don't know if I need to redo it again or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6269)|
| 1:44:34| But well, I think just put it on and we can either get it on this month or next month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| And I would hope that if we want to that, you know, of course that's at the chairman's discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6279)|
| 1:44:44| I think according to the new rules, but if we want to put it on this Monday, I'd be glad to hear it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6284)|
| 1:44:49| Then I think most of us would so so question on that one. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| Commissioner Smith's would have to come as an amendment to this. No, we would have this because that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6294)|
| 1:45:01| You said we passed from this point forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6301)|
| 1:45:04| Commissioner Smith's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| Taking taking through the court system was in the past so that he really wouldn't be affected by this ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6306)|
| 1:45:14| Right, so he would have to do something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| So could we could we do an amendment instead of a whole separate resolution on Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6316)|
| 1:45:22| No, no, let's see. There's two things here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6322)|
| 1:45:24| This this ordinance will not be passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6324)|
| 1:45:26| Even if everybody agrees with it for two months because it's an ordinance that takes to read, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| So this is going to take it till the end of August before this passes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| The way I would look at it is what is what what Larry Smith's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6335)|
| 1:45:41| Petition or whatever you want to call it would be to the Commission would be completely independent has nothing at all to do with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6341)|
| 1:45:47| Completely independent no connection. No relation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6347)|
| 1:45:50| No anything other than we've brought it, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6350)|
| 1:45:52| Brought it to a head right now and we can get it on and maybe get that taken care of long before this thing even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6352)|
| 1:45:59| You know passes and becomes effective because this won't become effective till the end of August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6359)|
| 1:46:03| But we can at this date still put a resolution on for next Monday. Yes for him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6363)|
| 1:46:11| This is an ordinance and his is a right right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| Should be a totally separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6374)|
| 1:46:17| situation anyway because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6377)|
| 1:46:19| Of the situation. Mm-hmm. These are two separate issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| Motion on the floor is to approve all those in favor. Say aye aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| Any opposition motion passes next item. Oh, was that to put on the resolution for Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6387)|
| 1:46:32| No, no, this was for the ordinance that we just passed. He will have to submit a resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6392)|
| 1:46:38| He has not submitted anything to put on the agenda yet he will from what I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6398)|
| 1:46:43| If you would check with a law department to make sure it gets on or you can check with Joe Lee to make sure it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6403)|

| 1:49:28| I got like people are sending one him as his way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6568)|
| 1:49:32| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6572)|
| 1:49:35| Okay, essentially my question is why close the road Dwight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6575)|
| 1:49:41| We initially got this discussion started commissioner when we were approached by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6581)|
| 1:49:46| Mr. Phillips and members of the Lambert family who owned property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6586)|
| 1:49:51| Adjacent to the road and they had expressed concerns over speed and the way that the road was being used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6591)|
| 1:49:58| we've made a number of site visits and reviewed the data that we have and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6598)|
| 1:50:03| Agree with their contention essentially as you know, Clinton Highway is four lane divided highway with 45 miles an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6603)|
| 1:50:11| coming down southbound to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| the intersection of Old Callaghan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| Drive and Clinton Highway where it's signalized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| Pleasant Ridge from the top of the ridge at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| Clinton Highway southbound is a two-lane local road that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6623)|
| 1:50:30| Starts one way actually at the top of the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| It has limited sight distance and steep grades actually has limited sight distance because of steep grades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6632)|
| 1:50:38| That comes down the hill one way at 30 miles an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6638)|
| 1:50:42| widens out and becomes a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| Two way though. It is still a two-lane road and proceeds through Old Callaghan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| It is not signalized and it is the through traffic at that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6649)|
| 1:50:54| Location people are using it really two ways. You're using it as a as the applicant state is an ad hoc exit ramp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6654)|
| 1:51:02| The average speed at the bottom of the hill is 44.9 miles an hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6662)|
| 1:51:06| It's posted for 30 essentially what's happening is people are maintaining the same speed as they exit Clinton Highway all the way down Pleasant Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6666)|
| 1:51:15| When I went out there and did my first site visit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6675)|
| 1:51:18| I had a hard time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6678)|
| 1:51:19| Turning around on Pleasant Ridge because I didn't think I could get a safe enough gap due to the short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6679)|
| 1:51:24| sight distances and the high speeds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6684)|
| 1:51:26| so we think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| It's 3,000 cars a day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| It is not inconsequential and and we're certainly would want this body to know that I do not expect this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6690)|
| 1:51:37| To be a particularly popular closure as these go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6697)|
| 1:51:41| But when you look at the speed of the traffic on Pleasant Ridge and you look at the two uses which are primarily to avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6701)|
| 1:51:47| the properly signalized intersection and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6707)|
| 1:51:49| Two and I actually have this as I think most of you do in the form of an email as a shortcut to Walmart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6709)|
| 1:51:55| And Taco Bell we think it's reasonable the the other point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| I should make commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6720)|
| 1:52:00| We don't actually intend to close the road what we want to do is close the the north end of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6720)|
| 1:52:06| Where Pleasant Ridge intersects Clinton Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6726)|
| 1:52:09| It's our intent to keep the road fully open and all the property owners that own property and anybody that might need to access any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6729)|
| 1:52:15| of those businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6735)|
| 1:52:16| Will still have access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6736)|
| 1:52:17| but they'll need to come in through the signalized intersection at old Callahan proceed north on Pleasant Ridge and we could open it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6737)|
| 1:52:24| Up to two-way traffic instead of having this oddball bifurcated configuration where you've got half the road one way and half the road two-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6744)|
| 1:52:32| So essentially though, it's a speed issue, right? Yes, sir at the core of it. It is absolutely a speed issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6752)|
| 1:52:37| I spoke to the sheriff about it. He concurs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6757)|
| 1:52:41| I think captain Ludwig is here if anybody has any questions from an enforcement standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6761)|
| 1:52:45| But they're aware of the fact that speeding is an issue there. We looked at a couple options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6765)|
| 1:52:50| We even thought about the possibility of making it a stop three-way stop at the bottom of the hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6770)|
| 1:52:56| but engineering standards don't necessarily support that we think we're safer to go ahead and just close the road at the top of the hill and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6776)|
| 1:53:03| Keep people from using it as a shortcut to Walmart and keep them from avoiding the signalized intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6783)|
| 1:53:08| well, you know, I'm a native of that area and I understand some of the concerns of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6788)|
| 1:53:16| People that live out there and there's a lot of people that they're not just going to Walmart and they're not just going to Taco Bell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6796)|
| 1:53:23| They're they're using it to access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| Pleasant Pleasant Ridge Road and and we have lots of methods of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6806)|
| 1:53:32| Entertaining the issue of speed besides closing roads, so I won't be in favor of this just by the way, who is mr. Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6812)|
| 1:53:40| He's the primary petitioner Howard Phillips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6820)|
| 1:53:43| Who is he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6823)|
| 1:53:44| One of the property owners and what property does he own the street address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6824)|
| 1:53:48| I couldn't recall but it's power realty in auction. I give you the street address if you like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| He's that's our power power realty in auction and the Lambert family. Yes, sir. Who would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6832)|
| 1:53:58| Earl Roy and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| Eula Lambert own property there are 12 parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6841)|
| 1:54:05| That adjoin the stretch of road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6845)|
| 1:54:08| Ten of those landowners have signed the canvas form indicating their desire to have it closed the 11th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6848)|
| 1:54:14| Which is shod properties has verbally committed that they would like to see it closed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6854)|
| 1:54:18| Only the 12th property owner who is a lady in Clinton is someone that hasn't been contacted yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6858)|
| 1:54:23| But all of the property owners 11 of the 12 that we have had contact with have requested the closure. Okay? Well, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6863)|
| 1:54:30| Understand that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6870)|
| 1:54:31| Mr. Van de Waay, but I would let you let you know we've a lot of us have received calls and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6871)|
| 1:54:37| That they'd like this to remain open and they'd like to see some address maybe of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6877)|
| 1:54:43| Speeding issue in some other way. So, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6883)|
| 1:54:47| Would you go ahead Commissioner Smith and I'll ask a question you said you had somebody from the Sheriff's Department. They want to speak on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6887)|
| 1:54:57| Captain Ludwig| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6897)|
| 1:55:01| Brad Ludwig not showing Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6901)|
| 1:55:04| Now 400 Main Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| I'm just going to answer any questions and say that I've been with the department for 34 years and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6906)|
| 1:55:13| One of the biggest problems is like semi trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6913)|
| 1:55:18| going to the end of that road and not realizing it stops and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6918)|
| 1:55:23| You can't turn around the semi. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6923)|
| 1:55:26| don't have the numbers in front of me, but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6926)|
| 1:55:30| specifically aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6930)|
| 1:55:33| A zillion wrecks down through there where they run off the road or etc| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6933)|
| 1:55:39| I'm familiar with it, too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6939)|
| 1:55:41| I've got a lot of business back in the industrial park back in there and you come to that stop sign out. I guess it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6941)|
| 1:55:46| Callaghan Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| Yeah, Callaghan there and you're looking as the traffic's coming at you and your traffic coming down over your right shoulder and stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6948)|
| 1:55:54| And those people come flying off that off Clinton Highway and come down. It's it's a little miss misleading. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6954)|
| 1:56:00| Appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6960)|
| 1:56:02| Benevite's letter here, but it says it took us 20 years to get the speed limit lowered to 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6962)|
| 1:56:09| versus 45| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6969)|
| 1:56:13| So I'm speaking definitely in favor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6973)|
| 1:56:19| Question for Dwight will you share with us the results of your studies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6979)|
| 1:56:23| You're going to be doing this between the first and second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6983)|
| 1:56:26| Yes, sir, what we would do if Commission votes this affirmatively on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| We'll go ahead and do the delay study prior to erecting the temporary barricades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| And we'll get averages on the length of time that people queue up at those lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6994)|
| 1:56:39| at the intersection at the signalized intersection and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=6999)|
| 1:56:43| Then we'll go ahead and erect the temporary barricades and we'll go ahead and do a follow-up study to see how much if if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7003)|
| 1:56:50| And how much we have increased the wait time at the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7010)|
| 1:56:54| Then if we do see that the wait time at the intersection at the signalized intersections is increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7014)|
| 1:56:58| we'd confer with city traffic engineering to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7018)|
| 1:57:01| Look at how the signal timing might be changed to improve the flow if it's necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7021)|
| 1:57:07| We don't yet know whether or not it'll be necessary. I wouldn't want I mean Commissioner Norman for you in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7027)|
| 1:57:11| I I live out there also and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7031)|
| 1:57:14| Approach this with some trepidation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7034)|
| 1:57:16| Because this is one of those things where neighbors are going to show up on my doorstep and ask me what I was thinking and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7036)|
| 1:57:21| Why we've done this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7041)|
| 1:57:23| and I am very mindful of that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7043)|
| 1:57:25| Actually approached it with some dose of skepticism till I went out there and did my first site visit and after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7045)|
| 1:57:31| I was a believer and I actually would encourage any of you if you have a chance to go out there and just drive this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7051)|
| 1:57:37| section of road be careful turning around on Pleasant Ridge and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7057)|
| 1:57:41| and give it a look yourself because all access is maintained and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7061)|
| 1:57:46| All we're trying to do is keep people on the four-lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| main thoroughfare and moving through the intersections that are signalized as opposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7070)|
| 1:57:56| using the the shortcut or the bypass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| That goes on over to Shod Road or in some cases to Walmart and Clinton Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7079)|
| 1:58:04| So if anyone calls us we should have them call you is that yes, sir| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7084)|
| 1:58:09| The motion on the floor is to approve all those in favor say aye| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7089)|
| 1:58:13| any opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| Motion passes next item. I don't know. See we're on discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| We have one discussion item with regards to rural metro pricing policies commissioner Shouse and right mr. Shouse. You're recognized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7100)|

| 1:58:42| she's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7122)|

| 1:58:54| and she sent a letter to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| all of Commission about a month ago a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7136)|
| 1:59:00| situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| regarding her father| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| who owned a piece of property out in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7143)|
| 1:59:06| Commissioner Wright's district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| Tazewell Pike and I'll just give a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7148)|
| 1:59:11| Snapshot of it. It was a fire at an old trailer. There was this gentleman had paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7151)|
| 1:59:16| $2,500 for 30 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7156)|
| 1:59:19| so the thing had virtually little value or probably net negative value consider if you had to remove it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7159)|
| 1:59:26| Because of the value of the trailer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7166)|

| 1:59:41| Unfortunately the trailer caught on fire the whoever lived there got out all right and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7181)|
| 1:59:46| That would have I guess in theory taken care of itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| however, a pastor by came by and called rural Metro or called 9-1-1 and they referenced rural Metro and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7189)|
| 1:59:56| a an engine showed up and then another engine and then another engine and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7196)|
| 2:00:01| ultimately four engines a tanker a tender and a squad car and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7201)|
| 2:00:06| I have a I live in a city as I think three or four of us do Tony and Sam and Amy I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7206)|
| 2:00:12| I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7212)|
| 2:00:13| pay for rural Metro and not really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7213)|
| 2:00:15| intricately aware of their subscription rates and charges and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7215)|
| 2:00:20| Abilities to charge although I've become aware of the abilities to charge because of this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7220)|
| 2:00:25| Nevertheless, I have met with rural Metro. I don't know if mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7225)|
| 2:00:28| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7228)|
| 2:00:29| Wright has or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7229)|
| 2:00:29| But I was contacted by him after this hit the agenda and met with them for an hour or so about a week and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7229)|
| 2:00:34| half ago and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7234)|
| 2:00:36| It was explained to me how to keep I think their ISO multiple engines have to show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7236)|
| 2:00:43| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7243)|
| 2:00:44| I'm not going to say this is reasonable or unreasonable the bottom line the gentleman got a bill for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7244)|
| 2:00:51| about over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7251)|
| 2:00:52| $18,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7252)|
| 2:00:55| And the letter references that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7255)|
| 2:00:59| The one engine shows up I see pork on the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7259)|
| 2:01:02| I guess puts the fire out over the next half an hour or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7262)|
| 2:01:07| The other six engines show up and according to the letter way five or just basically sitting in the driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7267)|
| 2:01:13| I guess that still may be I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| Policy to maintain the ISO standards. I'm not an expert on the policy and I see some rural Metro people here who may want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7275)|
| 2:01:22| reference that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7282)|
| 2:01:23| But and again, I'm not saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7283)|
| 2:01:25| $18,000 was excessive for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7285)|
| 2:01:29| Responding to an old trailer fire or not. It says who I just wanted to focus some attention on it and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7289)|
| 2:01:35| Respond to my colleague on the Audit Committee that you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| Knox County Commission cares about these things and we wanted to put some public scrutiny on it and discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7299)|
| 2:01:48| Mr. Wright do you have anything to add? Yes. Thank you. Mr. Chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| Being then a resident of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7312)|
| 2:01:56| Outside the city limits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7316)|
| 2:01:59| The discussion then arises about where or what does Knox County do about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7319)|
| 2:02:08| This particular complaint. I received the same email. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7328)|
| 2:02:16| Visited rural Metro's new facility and I guess the day or two or so after this was added to the consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7336)|
| 2:02:24| I mean to the agenda and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| Brought it up in the conversation that I had that there there is a citizen that was talking about what they felt like was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7348)|
| 2:02:37| High cost related to the response to this particular alarm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7357)|
| 2:02:42| I think one of the things that is a part of this discussion is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7362)|
| 2:02:49| We sitting as Commission, what do we do about fire protection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7369)|
| 2:02:54| Where where is our part in this particular dilemma and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7374)|
| 2:03:01| The I think rural Metro is relying on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7381)|
| 2:03:06| state statute about what they need to do and and you know conformity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7386)|
| 2:03:12| Response requirements and things like that. So I don't know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7392)|
| 2:03:17| Unless we want to have a larger broader discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7397)|
| 2:03:20| Of fire protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7400)|
| 2:03:21| I believe that what this family's brought to us is something that's kind of outside what we normally look at and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7401)|
| 2:03:29| That's why I felt like it need to be a discussion amongst Commission members to see if there would be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7409)|
| 2:03:38| discussion develop out of what what what has happened and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7418)|
| 2:03:43| You know might might add to that that every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7423)|
| 2:03:47| Two or three months I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7427)|
| 2:03:50| heard these discussions, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7430)|
| 2:03:52| in the past it's just sort of a build-up issue that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7432)|
| 2:03:58| Didn't feel like Commission needed to do something about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7438)|
| 2:04:01| but now we're probably at a point where it does need to become something that's discussed because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7441)|
| 2:04:08| Some of us represent mostly County I represent majority County some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7448)|
| 2:04:13| Commission just represents the city and so fire protection not an issue in the city. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7453)|
| 2:04:20| Know that where I live in South Knoxville now, it's roots Seymour volunteer fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7460)|
| 2:04:25| I know that we have the Carnes volunteer. We still have high school and we have rural Metro| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7465)|
| 2:04:29| And so I think you bring up a good point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| I think this is a discussion that we need to have in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7471)|
| 2:04:34| Fire protection for the county and where we want to go five ten years from now with this. Mr. Briggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7474)|
| 2:04:39| Yeah, I you know, I get I think my district's a hundred percent in the county. Well, I guess we may have somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7479)|
| 2:04:45| They've got these finger annexations. But other than that, the citizens are all living in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7485)|
| 2:04:50| We the county I see some folks here from rural Metro. The county doesn't give any supplement or anything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7490)|
| 2:04:57| I mean, we're not paying for anything. I mean, this is just a private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7497)|
| 2:05:00| contract between the citizens and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| That's correct. I think I mean we really don't have any any control over this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7504)|
| 2:05:08| I know I got called twice in the middle of the night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| About Lenore City utilities when we had the bad storm a couple of weeks ago wanting to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7511)|
| 2:05:16| Want me to call them that night? I mean this was 20 minutes after the storm hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7516)|
| 2:05:21| You know in the middle of the night about power that was out and I don't think we have any any issue here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7521)|
| 2:05:26| I think what Commissioner Wright brings up and I believe it was a month or two ago very quickly at one of our meetings is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7526)|
| 2:05:33| Brad Anders brought that same issue up, you know, we've we've had some questions about the the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7533)|
| 2:05:39| You know the high school volunteer fire department the Karnes fire department's had a lot of trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7539)|
| 2:05:45| Probably about every two months someone writes me where there's been a false alarm and a fire truck that you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7545)|
| 2:05:50| They have a fire one of these automatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7550)|
| 2:05:52| things in their house and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| There's a false alarm or a neighbor calls about smoke that turns out to be something else and they're complaining because they get a bill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7555)|
| 2:06:00| If they don't subscribe and and I think it's unfair to all the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7560)|
| 2:06:05| Subscription people because basically what we're doing. There's a cost shift on to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7565)|
| 2:06:11| to to pay for the people who don't subscribe and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7571)|
| 2:06:15| You know, it's really quite frankly. It's really it's really not fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7575)|
| 2:06:19| You know as far as this I don't know what's reasonable or unreasonable for the number of the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7579)|
| 2:06:24| I got the same letter that you all did regarding this and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7584)|
| 2:06:28| Basically, I think the reason they didn't have fire service was they said if my fire if my trailer caught on fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7588)|
| 2:06:33| We'll just let it burn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7593)|
| 2:06:34| and other people may feel that way about homes that don't have a lot of value, but you know, it can affect other people and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7594)|
| 2:06:41| How do you know someone's not in the house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7601)|
| 2:06:43| I mean, how do you determine which fires to put out and what fires not to put out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| I quite frankly don't think that's a valid argument. It maybe is a valid argument about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7606)|
| 2:06:51| You know what what the proper response is and if that's set by some sort of federal codes and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7611)|
| 2:06:56| there may not be much of an argument about that, but getting back to the point of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7616)|
| 2:07:01| Do we need to have a broader discussion over what we need to do to provide fire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7621)|
| 2:07:05| Coverage in Knox County. I think that's something that does need to bring up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7625)|
| 2:07:09| I mean, it's it's a little bit of a third rail because it may involve a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7629)|
| 2:07:15| Surcharge or the are that three-letter cuss word called tax that no one wants to say in public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7635)|
| 2:07:22| But but on the other hand if we look at what our responsibilities are what government's responsibilities are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7642)|
| 2:07:28| We talked about public safety with with the Sheriff's Department and police protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7648)|
| 2:07:33| We're also talking about public safety when you get into the arena of fire coverage also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7653)|
| 2:07:40| And so I think that may be something that we need to that nobody wants to talk about, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7660)|
| 2:07:45| We always divert our eyes when that comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7665)|
| 2:07:47| But I think it may be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7667)|
| 2:07:49| That we you know that we do need to bring up just as part of the of the general discussion on public safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7669)|
| 2:07:56| Mr. Brown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7676)|
| 2:07:58| Thank You. Mr. Chairman chief Harnish, can you come up, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7678)|
| 2:08:04| While he's coming I would say I would agree with what's been said so far that they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7684)|
| 2:08:09| We're reaching a point where that as we've seen the high school the Karnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7689)|
| 2:08:14| Departments the volunteer departments are really really struggling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7694)|
| 2:08:19| And it's the point where that they really can't take care of it anymore and rural Metro has been stepping up and filling in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7699)|
| 2:08:27| on on some of those but my question I guess chief is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7707)|
| 2:08:33| Have you done any studies of other counties what they have done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7713)|
| 2:08:39| In rural sections the county versus well, you would be totally ruled because the city takes care of the city, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7719)|
| 2:08:48| Ways of setting it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7728)|
| 2:08:52| Not necessarily through a tax, but a surcharge, but how are some of the other counties handling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7732)|
| 2:08:59| this type situation where that they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7739)|
| 2:09:02| Get their, you know constituents covered. I don't want to turn out to be a welfare system where that, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7742)|
| 2:09:07| Hey, I'm not going to buy fire insurance because County's gonna pay for having my fire put out. I don't think that's fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7747)|
| 2:09:12| I mean, well the county doesn't pay it's the other citizens pay right? That's what I'm saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7752)|
| 2:09:17| But well, that's what we're talking about in this case, but it's it's a lot of money when you look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7757)|
| 2:09:22| I had a case where that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7762)|
| 2:09:25| Will Metro did help out on some but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7765)|
| 2:09:28| is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7768)|
| 2:09:30| Is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7770)|
| 2:09:32| any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7772)|
| 2:09:33| Models out there of counties who are doing something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7773)|
| 2:09:36| We could possibly take a look at is this something you could look into?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7776)|
| 2:09:41| um| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7781)|
| 2:09:42| Where are we on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7782)|
| 2:09:44| Well commissioner to answer your question. Yes, there are many models out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7784)|
| 2:09:49| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7789)|
| 2:09:50| Ultimate reality though is is fire protection is expensive and it has to be paid for it through some means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7790)|
| 2:09:57| Uh, knox county has some tools in its toolbox that are not available to many counties in tennessee because you are homeroom county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7797)|
| 2:10:06| however| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7806)|
| 2:10:07| Your options really come down to some version of three things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7807)|
| 2:10:12| You you either tax for it and contract with an agency like us or provide your own agency to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7812)|
| 2:10:19| You you subsidize it in some way and then provide a safety net| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7819)|
| 2:10:25| For property owners that would have difficulty paying for it on their own or you or you regulate it in some way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7825)|
| 2:10:31| which in essence is what is happening now in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110718?start=7831)|
