| 5:02:10| Well, it could be, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18130)|
| 5:02:12| Honestly, the Knoxville Symphony Society is the umbrella organization for the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18132)|
| 5:02:20| So it turns out to be the same thing, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18140)|
| 5:02:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18142)|
| 5:02:23| It runs both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18143)|
| 5:02:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18145)|
| 5:02:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18146)|
| 5:02:28| Bill Snyder, Tennessee Theatre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18148)|
| 5:02:36| Bill Snyder, 3312 Kenilworth Lane, Knoxville, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18156)|
| 5:02:41| I have three very brief comments to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18161)|
| 5:02:44| And, Mr. Chair, I may be able to return you about 30 seconds of my two-minute allotted time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18164)|
| 5:02:49| First, I want to thank, as many people have, Knox County government through the commission for supporting the arts and culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18169)|
| 5:02:56| And I don't need to convince everyone in this room how important the arts and culture are to the quality of life that we have in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18176)|
| 5:03:04| We have many, many opportunities for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18184)|
| 5:03:07| Second thing I want to say is to endorse and commend the process that was used, particularly with the citizens' review committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18187)|
| 5:03:17| Those sessions where we were allowed to come and defend our proposals were very well organized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18197)|
| 5:03:23| and it gives citizens a chance to express themselves on how their tax dollars are to be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18203)|
| 5:03:29| And the third comment is to express appreciation for what, at this point, I will call the recommended grant that's in the budget, as it now exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18209)|
| 5:03:39| which will support the James A. Dick Mighty Musical Monday program at the Tennessee Theatre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18219)|
| 5:03:47| Of the many diverse programs presented at the Tennessee Theatre, I guess I have more passion for this program than any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18227)|
| 5:03:56| because it serves a group of people that otherwise would not have the Tennessee Theatre experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18236)|
| 5:04:04| About 75% of the people that come to this program are senior citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18244)|
| 5:04:09| They're brought in by buses and vans from assisted living places, and they can't afford the cost of the rock shows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18249)|
| 5:04:17| and they probably wouldn't choose them anyway, and they don't go out at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18257)|
| 5:04:21| So it gives them, about 800 to 1,000 people attend this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18261)|
| 5:04:26| It gives them an opportunity to share in that magnificent facility which Mr. James Dick made possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18266)|
| 5:04:33| So thank you very much for all you do, and I'll be glad to entertain any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18273)|
| 5:04:38| Do we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18278)|
| 5:04:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18280)|
| 5:04:45| All right. Tamara, Hopes Resource Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18285)|
| 5:04:54| Not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18294)|
| 5:05:00| Nkeke Adjanaku.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18300)|
| 5:05:04| All right, Commissioner Rouleau. That was good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18304)|
| 5:05:06| I had a little help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18306)|
| 5:05:10| She was whispering in my ear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18310)|
| 5:05:12| She's a great help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18312)|
| 5:05:13| Yes, she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18313)|
| 5:05:14| Again, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18314)|
| 5:05:15| I want to say thank you to all of the leadership that came together in these past three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18315)|
| 5:05:21| It's been very hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18321)|
| 5:05:22| That's Gloria Ray, Lisa Zinney, Mayor Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18322)|
| 5:05:25| They were always an open ear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18325)|
| 5:05:27| I know that those of us who had these organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18327)|
| 5:05:30| Oh, back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18330)|
| 5:05:31| Nkeke Adjanaku, 2725 Wimpole Avenue, 37914, with African American Appalachian Arts Incorporated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18331)|
| 5:05:41| I just want to, again, continue that everybody has always had an open heart, open ear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18341)|
| 5:05:46| We've been in business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18346)|
| 5:05:47| This is our 20th anniversary this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18347)|
| 5:05:49| We're calling it a platinum celebration through all of our ups, downs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18349)|
| 5:05:53| It's always been very, very intense in relationship to funding the four-day festival that we offer to Knox County in the East Tennessee region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18353)|
| 5:06:04| I just want to say that we do serve approximately 25,000 people a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18364)|
| 5:06:11| We do block a number of rooms annually that we consciously try to track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18371)|
| 5:06:17| We make sure that we block about 100 rooms per year for our vendors and people who come and serve in our marketplace at Chill Highway Park for two days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18377)|
| 5:06:26| And we also have to block the rooms for our entertainers and our guests that we offer that service to, to encourage people in tourism in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18386)|
| 5:06:36| The figures that we've developed in the last five years is that annually, at the minimum, we impact the level, especially in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18396)|
| 5:06:45| the East Knoxville area from Magnolia to Strawberry Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18405)|
| 5:06:49| We impact these ranges from 500,000 to a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18409)|
| 5:06:53| Those figures that we worked out with people in the Knox County staff over the years when we were doing the cultural heritage tourism funding and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18413)|
| 5:07:03| So that we do, we try to have some sense of the economic impact that we're bringing to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18423)|
| 5:07:10| Also, we have our Coomba Camp, and we do that at Austin East every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18430)|
| 5:07:15| Three weeks prior to the festival, we service around 80 children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18435)|
| 5:07:19| And as I start to contemplate that particular program, those are 80 children, primarily teenagers, that we keep busy every day for five days a week during the summertime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18439)|
| 5:07:31| And that's very, very important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18451)|
| 5:07:33| I live in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18453)|
| 5:07:34| I can walk to Austin East High School without being out of breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18454)|
| 5:07:38| It's very important for me to make sure that that program continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18458)|
| 5:07:44| Again, say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18464)|
| 5:07:45| That we do try hard to develop corporate sponsorship and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18465)|
| 5:07:49| Any assistance, references, point me to the person, I'll go get the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18469)|
| 5:07:53| And also I want to echo what Phyllis is talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18473)|
| 5:07:56| We do need to have that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18476)|
| 5:07:58| And as I feel as a leader in the community, that I would more than happily serve at any capacity to have that discussion about the importance of non-profits, arts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18478)|
| 5:08:08| cultural, entertainment in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18488)|
| 5:08:10| Thank you so much, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18490)|
| 5:08:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18491)|
| 5:08:12| Do we have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18492)|
| 5:08:14| Thank you for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18494)|
| 5:08:17| Elaine Streno with Second Harvest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18497)|
| 5:08:24| Hi, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18504)|
| 5:08:26| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18506)|
| 5:08:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18507)|
| 5:08:28| Elaine Streno, 10029 Autumn Valley Lane, Knoxville, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18508)|
| 5:08:34| I, too, want to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18514)|
| 5:08:37| And I want to apologize for all of the drama that we've all worked on the last three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18517)|
| 5:08:42| I was told when I got here today that there was some discussion about a possible grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18522)|
| 5:08:47| And I truly want to let you guys know how many e-mails I got today from people who had read the paper today that said, wow, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18527)|
| 5:08:56| I've never seen them all work together so well for one cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18536)|
| 5:09:01| And so I appreciate that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18541)|
| 5:09:05| I wanted to make sure you guys knew what you were going to be able to help us with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18545)|
| 5:09:09| Last month, and that would be the month of April, we had 89,269 requests for food just from the 123 agencies that we serve in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18549)|
| 5:09:20| Again, we serve 18 counties, but this is all about what we're doing for Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18560)|
| 5:09:26| In addition, we are in 41 schools providing backpacks and food to 1,576 Knox County students who take the food home over the weekend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18566)|
| 5:09:37| and get some nutrition and hopefully ease some anxiety on what's going on in their house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18577)|
| 5:09:45| I invite all of you to come to Second Harvest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18585)|
| 5:09:48| Some of you have been able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18588)|
| 5:09:51| And I truly hope you all get to do that because you'll be able to see how we operate out of our 21,000 square foot warehouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18591)|
| 5:09:58| So I'm just here to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18598)|
| 5:10:00| Again, I hadn't been able to meet all of you guys and wanted to make sure that was known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18600)|
| 5:10:05| Anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18605)|
| 5:10:07| Mr. Lambert?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18607)|
| 5:10:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18609)|
| 5:10:10| Have you all filled out all of your paperwork yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18610)|
| 5:10:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18613)|
| 5:10:14| It was delivered to Mr. Arnett's office last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18614)|
| 5:10:18| That was the most important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18618)|
| 5:10:22| That's part of what that workshop was about, to let you know what information needed to be filled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18622)|
| 5:10:29| Can you tell me what are the salaries of your two top people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18629)|
| 5:10:33| My salary, I'm the top person, is $80,000 a year with some bonus issues that my board decides on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18633)|
| 5:10:43| And the next would be $62,500, and that's what my two vice presidents in their different capacities make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18643)|
| 5:10:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18653)|
| 5:10:54| And how many dollars' worth of products do you accept and distribute each year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18654)|
| 5:11:00| What I'm trying to do is put this in perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18660)|
| 5:11:02| A lot of folks out there watching, they may hear $80,000 plus bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18662)|
| 5:11:08| but I think what they're not realizing is that you're probably taking in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18668)|
| 5:11:13| and distributing more food than a lot of grocery store chains whose CEOs would make ten times that, is what I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18673)|
| 5:11:22| Do you have any idea what dollar amount of product flows through your organization?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18682)|
| 5:11:27| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18687)|
| 5:11:28| I might need a calculator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18688)|
| 5:11:30| Somebody can help me on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18690)|
| 5:11:32| We, last year, distributed 11.2 million pounds of food throughout our service area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18692)|
| 5:11:38| out of the 18 vehicles that we have picking up and delivering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18698)|
| 5:11:42| That food, and we are a national organization, Feeding America, and that food is valued at $1.68 per pound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18702)|
| 5:11:49| So it would be $1.68 times 11.2 million pounds of food is what we are distributing throughout the 18 county service area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18709)|
| 5:11:58| Anybody want to do that math?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18718)|
| 5:12:00| $16.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18720)|
| 5:12:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18722)|
| 5:12:05| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18725)|
| 5:12:06| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18726)|
| 5:12:08| You mentioned a while ago that you service 17 different counties out of your?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18728)|
| 5:12:13| We serve 18 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18733)|
| 5:12:15| Eighteen counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18735)|
| 5:12:16| How many of these 18 counties are contributing financially to your work there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18736)|
| 5:12:22| The government agencies, it would be just Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18742)|
| 5:12:27| We are starting to expand into Blunt-Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18747)|
| 5:12:30| We get United Way funding from Blunt-Anderson, Cumberland, pretty much all of the counties that we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18750)|
| 5:12:36| And we know that is something we need to work on, and we are going to be processing that in the next couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18756)|
| 5:12:44| Our fundraising is pretty aggressive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18764)|
| 5:12:47| and so we receive a large amount of funding throughout our service area through our direct mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18767)|
| 5:12:52| And I could get you those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18772)|
| 5:12:54| I just don't have those stats with me right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18774)|
| 5:12:56| Well, it just seems to me that if our unit here in Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18776)|
| 5:13:01| Knox County, is funding 18 different counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18781)|
| 5:13:05| then they need to be participating in the plan and helping us fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18785)|
| 5:13:10| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18790)|
| 5:13:11| I don't see us funding it for 18 counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18791)|
| 5:13:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18794)|
| 5:13:15| Well, I want to make sure you guys heard that we distributed food to 86,000 Knox County residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18795)|
| 5:13:23| and that is what your, of course, generous funding is helping us with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18803)|
| 5:13:27| in addition to the 41 schools that we're in, and that's just in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18807)|
| 5:13:31| But I do understand your concern, and that's something we're truly working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18811)|
| 5:13:36| But still, you may have served 86,000 in Knox County and 41 schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18816)|
| 5:13:43| The total amount of food and stuff coming in here going out to other counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18823)|
| 5:13:50| nobody is helping you county-wise except Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18830)|
| 5:13:55| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18835)|
| 5:13:56| That's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18836)|
| 5:13:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18837)|
| 5:13:58| And, again, we're going to be working on that and working with the local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18838)|
| 5:14:03| We've had a real challenge in trying to get people to understand what we're doing in their counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18843)|
| 5:14:07| if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18847)|
| 5:14:09| And the Food for Kids program, that's been the one that most of the counties have really paid attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18849)|
| 5:14:14| So that's what we'll be doing specifically for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18854)|
| 5:14:17| Are you tracking dollar amounts that go to each of these counties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18857)|
| 5:14:21| Yes, sir, and I can provide all of that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18861)|
| 5:14:24| And that's what they'll be presented with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18864)|
| 5:14:26| We have all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18866)|
| 5:14:29| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18869)|
| 5:14:30| I was going to ask the same question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18870)|
| 5:14:32| because I think there's a lot of things that we're funding here that are regional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18872)|
| 5:14:35| and I don't appreciate taking care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18875)|
| 5:14:39| In law enforcement, I already know that they're busing and they're homeless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18879)|
| 5:14:42| and I don't want to start funding other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18882)|
| 5:14:46| So I would appreciate next year when you come back that you've got a plan that's been in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18886)|
| 5:14:51| and already asked those other governments before you come and ask us to feed other counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18891)|
| 5:14:56| I would appreciate that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18896)|
| 5:14:58| Well, I do have all kinds of reports back at Second Harvest that I can provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18898)|
| 5:15:03| that let you know that this funding stays in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18903)|
| 5:15:06| I want to assure you of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18906)|
| 5:15:10| Commissioner, are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18910)|
| 5:15:12| I just want to be clear that I want the community to be clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18912)|
| 5:15:18| that we're not sending money and food somewhere else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18918)|
| 5:15:21| when we're having a budget shortfall just like everybody else is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18921)|
| 5:15:25| I certainly understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18925)|
| 5:15:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18927)|
| 5:15:28| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18928)|
| 5:15:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18929)|
| 5:15:30| Maybe we need to get some figures here because I think we're headed in the wrong direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18930)|
| 5:15:34| What's your total annual budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18934)|
| 5:15:36| $3.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18936)|
| 5:15:38| And how much is Knox County contributing to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18938)|
| 5:15:43| Well, this year I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18943)|
| 5:15:45| Last year it was $81,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18945)|
| 5:15:47| This year I'm not sure what the last final proposal was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18947)|
| 5:15:51| I think it's proposed $50,000, Elaine, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18951)|
| 5:15:54| So Knox County contributing $50,000 on a $3 million...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18954)|
| 5:16:01| $3.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18961)|
| 5:16:03| ...is insignificant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18963)|
| 5:16:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18966)|
| 5:16:08| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18968)|
| 5:16:09| And I would challenge everybody to go down and tour the operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18969)|
| 5:16:12| I've been there numerous times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18972)|
| 5:16:14| and it looks like a distribution center for a major grocery store chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18974)|
| 5:16:20| It's obviously a regional center, and if you go and look at what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18980)|
| 5:16:25| they move a lot of food through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18985)|
| 5:16:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18988)|
| 5:16:29| I welcome all of you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18989)|
| 5:16:31| I would appreciate and enjoy showing you guys around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18991)|
| 5:16:35| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18995)|
| 5:16:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18997)|
| 5:16:38| And I hesitate to speak on this, but I think we're being short-sighted when we say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=18998)|
| 5:16:46| if we give money, we want all that money to stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19006)|
| 5:16:51| Alcoa probably has as many people that live in Knox County that work at their facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19011)|
| 5:16:58| They're paying their taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19018)|
| 5:16:59| They're shopping here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19019)|
| 5:17:02| I live in Knoxville, work in Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19022)|
| 5:17:05| People commute from all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19025)|
| 5:17:07| I think we need to look at the big picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19027)|
| 5:17:10| I thank Commissioner Wright for his point, because it really is a valid one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19030)|
| 5:17:14| But when you talk about Commissioner Lambert's statement, they have a huge facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19034)|
| 5:17:18| Where is that facility located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19038)|
| 5:17:19| It's in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19039)|
| 5:17:21| Where are those workers coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19041)|
| 5:17:24| I think if we really want to engage in this kind of protectionism and fence building around Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19044)|
| 5:17:31| we only fund Knox County projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19051)|
| 5:17:34| I think that's a very dangerous conversation to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19054)|
| 5:17:37| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19057)|
| 5:17:38| Now, if we're funding something else that's located in Rome County, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19058)|
| 5:17:44| HT Hackney is saying we want money to build a ball field around there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19064)|
| 5:17:48| I can understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19068)|
| 5:17:50| But, you know, as we look at these entities, it's a complicated picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19070)|
| 5:17:54| And I don't think we need to pigeonhole it by saying we want only money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19074)|
| 5:17:59| If we're giving you $50,000, we want it to stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19079)|
| 5:18:03| I mean, that's not the way this economy works in this region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19083)|
| 5:18:07| And I think also, and I'll shut up, I think that's a big reason that Knox County hadn't been hit as hard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19087)|
| 5:18:14| because Knox County realizes, I mean, we are the hub of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19094)|
| 5:18:19| You know, you can talk with Gloria and Mike, and they'll tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19099)|
| 5:18:24| This is a region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19104)|
| 5:18:26| This is a regional area, and Knox County has benefited from being the hub of that region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19106)|
| 5:18:32| So I'm going to get off my soapbox here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19112)|
| 5:18:34| but I think we need to be very careful as we try to keep all the money here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19114)|
| 5:18:41| And I do want to make a point, and maybe I didn't make myself clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19121)|
| 5:18:44| We are requesting money from the 18-county service area, from foundations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19124)|
| 5:18:49| We just got $15,000 from the Alcoa Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19129)|
| 5:18:52| We are not asking for money in these communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19132)|
| 5:18:55| We just haven't tackled the county governments, which will be the last hurdle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19135)|
| 5:18:59| I'm sorry if I didn't make that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19139)|
| 5:19:02| And in addition, United Ways, again, almost all of the service areas that we serve, we're getting funding from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19142)|
| 5:19:09| So I apologize if I screwed that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19149)|
| 5:19:12| I understood you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19152)|
| 5:19:14| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19154)|
| 5:19:16| Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks, Elaine, for coming up today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19156)|
| 5:19:20| Have you, we've probably, since we started at 8.30 this morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19160)|
| 5:19:23| probably received 30 pieces of paper and documents and booklets and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19163)|
| 5:19:28| And sorting through it, there's a document here from the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19168)|
| 5:19:32| and the lower third of the page he says he's making a one-time appropriation of $50,000 to your program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19172)|
| 5:19:40| Are you familiar with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19180)|
| 5:19:41| I was told that when I got here, and thank you very much for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19181)|
| 5:19:44| So that's, I'm assuming, what's moving forward as we speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19184)|
| 5:19:48| It's not what you got last year, but it's not zero either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19188)|
| 5:19:52| Right, and we are grateful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19192)|
| 5:19:54| I want to put that on the table, and I don't know where, I'm assuming it moves forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19194)|
| 5:19:58| We haven't discussed it in detail, but the mayor and Mr. Troy apparently are saying that the budget can handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19198)|
| 5:20:04| So it looks like that's where we're headed for your program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19204)|
| 5:20:08| Any comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19208)|
| 5:20:09| You said thank you, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19209)|
| 5:20:11| No, I mean, I just think it's wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19211)|
| 5:20:13| And, again, I said this morning, I got a bunch of emails saying it was so great to see the county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19213)|
| 5:20:17| those who were interviewed by the reporter from the Sentinel, come together on this one challenge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19217)|
| 5:20:23| and I apologize for making it challenging and getting it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19223)|
| 5:20:27| So I thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19227)|
| 5:20:29| It does, let me re-quote it, it says a one-time appropriation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19229)|
| 5:20:33| So we have work to do commissioning, and you and your people also, and your board for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19233)|
| 5:20:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19240)|
| 5:20:42| Thank you, and good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19242)|
| 5:20:46| We have a couple of people that wanted to speak that were on the various panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19246)|
| 5:20:56| First off, before we get into that, I just want to thank Gloria Ray for her leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19256)|
| 5:21:03| and helping out in sort of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19263)|
| 5:21:08| We're in a tight sort of fix here with some of these folks that deserve some money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19268)|
| 5:21:16| And, Gloria, you came through in leadership and trying to do what you can to help those that weren't receiving funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19276)|
| 5:21:28| but I believe were deservingly so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19288)|
| 5:21:31| And I want to just appreciate, let you know how much I appreciate you stepping forward with your organization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19291)|
| 5:21:38| and willing to share the, you didn't have to necessarily,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19298)|
| 5:21:42| but stepping forward with the hotel-motel tax and your leadership, and I want to thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19302)|
| 5:21:49| You rock, Gloria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19309)|
| 5:21:52| That's $185,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19312)|
| 5:21:57| Thank you so much, Chairman and other commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19317)|
| 5:22:00| But let me, I hope there's not a whole lot of me, let me just set the record straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19320)|
| 5:22:05| You all have a contract with the KTSC to be stewards of the hotel-motel tax of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19325)|
| 5:22:14| And we take very seriously our responsibility, fiduciary-wise, to spend that money in the proper way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19334)|
| 5:22:21| So while I'm very flattered by all the references to me and my name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19341)|
| 5:22:27| in reality, this is hotel-motel tax collected on behalf of Knox County that is very definite as to how it should be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19347)|
| 5:22:39| And you have contracted with us to spend that wisely, to grow that fund, and to use it in the way it should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19359)|
| 5:22:47| Commissioner Pinkston took great pride in saying to me, how can you spend money you don't already have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19367)|
| 5:22:54| Well, the deal is this is our depreciation fund from the 08-09 budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19374)|
| 5:23:01| And so that's why we refer to it as a one-time thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19381)|
| 5:23:04| It seemed like, after meeting with the mayor and Lisa as to how do we deal with these organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19384)|
| 5:23:10| this might be the time to invest in these organizations and programs that we then can market to out-of-town visitors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19390)|
| 5:23:21| The local business, the local people, the citizens that Knox County serves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19401)|
| 5:23:27| also need to be addressed in terms of the arts and cultural going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19407)|
| 5:23:32| And, you know, I think maybe the citizens panel, you know, I know they have a tough job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19412)|
| 5:23:38| And when that category says tourism, maybe it really ought to say arts and cultural alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19418)|
| 5:23:43| You've given the tourism to us and we're trying to do what we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19423)|
| 5:23:48| In our annual budget, we put aside money every year to assist in tourism-related activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19428)|
| 5:23:55| An example would be the Dogwood Arts Festival this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19435)|
| 5:23:59| I don't know what you all call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19439)|
| 5:24:00| The year that we're in, we awarded $10,000 to help with the printing and distribution of their guides that go to out-of-town people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19440)|
| 5:24:11| not to the local people because it's our job to get out-of-town people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19451)|
| 5:24:15| Ramsey House is an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19455)|
| 5:24:16| When their trees fell down, they didn't have a way, nor was it in their budget, a line item, pick up trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19456)|
| 5:24:23| So we were able to look at that from our stakeholders' partners and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19463)|
| 5:24:27| we're sending people out to the Ramsey House all the time to visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19467)|
| 5:24:32| And to James White Fort needed two new roofs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19472)|
| 5:24:35| So we are being stewards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19475)|
| 5:24:37| We hope in a way that you're pleased that we can continue to grow that and in a way that's responsible to tourism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19477)|
| 5:24:43| And so while I appreciate being recognized for this, in reality, it is Knox County money in the hotel-motel tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19483)|
| 5:24:51| It's the depreciation from our budget for 08-09.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19491)|
| 5:24:55| So thank you for saying you appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19495)|
| 5:24:58| But in reality, you're thanking yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19498)|
| 5:25:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19500)|
| 5:25:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19501)|
| 5:25:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19502)|
| 5:25:04| Chuck Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19504)|
| 5:25:08| He was on the youth committee panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19508)|
| 5:25:14| You have two minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19514)|
| 5:25:15| Chuck Williams, 1137 West Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19515)|
| 5:25:18| Basically, I'm here to answer any of your questions as to why we did it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19518)|
| 5:25:22| because I got ripped like I don't know what in newspapers, but that don't bother me too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19522)|
| 5:25:27| The way I went about it, when we met as a panel, they gave us a book with all the organizations in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19527)|
| 5:25:35| I read them, made an initial idea what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19535)|
| 5:25:38| Then we had to give to Ben Chappelle all our questions for each organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19538)|
| 5:25:45| They were supposed to respond back at their presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19545)|
| 5:25:49| Project Grad didn't even show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19549)|
| 5:25:52| We all just eliminate them right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19552)|
| 5:25:55| Boys and Girls Club did not answer any questions as far as the money for the duck races,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19555)|
| 5:26:01| the former golf tournament, Major League Baseball, and all the sponsorship money they receive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19561)|
| 5:26:07| So I just eliminate them right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19567)|
| 5:26:11| Plus, I felt like they are very self-sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19571)|
| 5:26:15| I also researched each organization on my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19575)|
| 5:26:19| I even went to some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19579)|
| 5:26:21| I even spoke to some people about various organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19581)|
| 5:26:25| So that's how I basically came to my ideas as to who to do what for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19585)|
| 5:26:30| As a citizen now speaking, I was told that this was supposed to be a one or two shot deal for organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19590)|
| 5:26:41| I don't feel organizations that are self-sufficient or have major sponsorship should be allowed to ask for money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19601)|
| 5:26:49| Like you're just talking about this other organization, $3.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19609)|
| 5:26:54| $50,000 is a drop in the bucket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19614)|
| 5:26:56| That's the max they can ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19616)|
| 5:26:58| So organizations like Boys and Girls Club, Big Brother, Big Sister, major organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19618)|
| 5:27:04| they should not be allowed to ask for any money because we have too many other organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19624)|
| 5:27:09| like the Shorer Foundation, Fountain City Youth Ministries that are barely making it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19629)|
| 5:27:15| But the county is not supposed to be an ATM machine every year for these people either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19635)|
| 5:27:20| So I don't think they, once you get money twice, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19640)|
| 5:27:24| You shouldn't come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19644)|
| 5:27:25| If you can't make it, then go on a new line of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19645)|
| 5:27:28| Sounds heartless, but that's just the way I feel about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19648)|
| 5:27:31| Secondly, they didn't always list all their sponsorships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19651)|
| 5:27:35| It's not hard to go to Google and Nexus Lexus to find out what other companies are supporting these people that they did not put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19655)|
| 5:27:44| And I think they should automatically be eliminated right off the bat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19664)|
| 5:27:48| A lot of them, they have friends on the commission and other places, and they feel like we got it made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19668)|
| 5:27:54| so they're going to do what they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19674)|
| 5:27:56| But basically, I'm just here to answer anybody's questions as to how I made my selection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19676)|
| 5:28:01| We met as a group, but we followed the Sunshine Law, so you ain't got to worry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19681)|
| 5:28:07| We just discussed what we thought, and then we all made our own decisions on our own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19687)|
| 5:28:12| First off, I just want to thank you and the rest of the citizens that served.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19692)|
| 5:28:17| I know you all put in a great deal of volunteer hours, and I appreciate every single one of you for serving and what you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19697)|
| 5:28:26| I think every panelist went through and, to the best of their ability, tried to be as thorough as possible, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19706)|
| 5:28:38| And, you know, I'm not sitting here questioning how you came up with your decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19718)|
| 5:28:45| I just think we need to go through and make sure this is the commission's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19725)|
| 5:28:53| And we need to make sure that when we vote on it, that we take the same due diligence that you took in coming up with the way you did as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19733)|
| 5:29:05| But I do appreciate what you've done for Knox County and the amount of hours you did it, and I think you did a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19745)|
| 5:29:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19753)|
| 5:29:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19754)|
| 5:29:15| Well, the first meeting, Commissioner McKenzie, Commissioner Brown, Commissioner Smith came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19755)|
| 5:29:24| And they spoke and more or less, I guess you'd say, charged us and said, but hey, we do have final say, which I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19764)|
| 5:29:30| I have no problems with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19770)|
| 5:29:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19771)|
| 5:29:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19772)|
| 5:29:34| Commissioner Burroughs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19774)|
| 5:29:36| I just want to say congratulations to Chuck for being a recent college graduate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19776)|
| 5:29:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19780)|
| 5:29:41| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19781)|
| 5:29:47| Commissioner Shouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19787)|
| 5:29:48| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19788)|
| 5:29:49| A minor item, Mr. Williams, but you said the project grad didn't show up in representation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19789)|
| 5:29:54| They didn't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19794)|
| 5:29:55| Now, this was my first time on a youth panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19795)|
| 5:29:58| There were two people on this panel with me this year that served on it last year, and they said they did the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19798)|
| 5:30:05| They didn't show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19805)|
| 5:30:06| They didn't respond to any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19806)|
| 5:30:08| So the boys and girls clubs didn't show?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19808)|
| 5:30:11| No, boys and girls clubs showed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19811)|
| 5:30:14| I have two pages of questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19814)|
| 5:30:16| I submitted to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19816)|
| 5:30:18| She didn't answer one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19818)|
| 5:30:20| It was just like, this is what we do, this is why we want the money, and she left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19820)|
| 5:30:24| And I couldn't justify myself with the board, with the CEO and the executive vice president making over $100,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19824)|
| 5:30:33| and you won't even respond to our questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19833)|
| 5:30:35| Plus, like I said, my main concern was, like last month they made a million dollars clear and free on the former golf tournament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19835)|
| 5:30:43| They make that every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19843)|
| 5:30:45| The duck races and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19845)|
| 5:30:46| Where's that money going that you need $50,000 of taxpayers' money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19846)|
| 5:30:51| They didn't answer the question, so I just threw them off my list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19851)|
| 5:30:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19856)|
| 5:30:57| Well, that number also jumped out at me that it was a six-figure salary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19857)|
| 5:31:01| and the other, the project grad is approaching six-figure salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19861)|
| 5:31:05| Yeah, those are things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19865)|
| 5:31:06| It's strange that high-paid executives didn't, as you satisfactory, didn't come to the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19866)|
| 5:31:14| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19874)|
| 5:31:15| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19875)|
| 5:31:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19876)|
| 5:31:17| Appreciate the job you did for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19877)|
| 5:31:20| Anytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19880)|
| 5:31:21| You know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19881)|
| 5:31:22| We had Melanie Purcell was on the panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19882)|

| 5:31:31| Kay Newton served on one of the panels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19891)|
| 5:31:51| Kay Newton, 1006 Luttrell, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19911)|
| 5:31:55| First of all, I want to say it is an honor and a privilege to serve on the panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19915)|
| 5:32:00| and I appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19920)|
| 5:32:02| I do not begrudge any of my time, and I have enjoyed every minute of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19922)|
| 5:32:07| even though sometimes I've sort of torn my hair out at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19927)|
| 5:32:12| Everybody else has said what I was going to say up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19932)|
| 5:32:16| except that it seems that whenever money gets tight, the arts, music,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19936)|
| 5:32:23| all these so-called fringe elements that we don't actually have to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19943)|
| 5:32:29| doesn't put a roof over our head, doesn't put food in our stomachs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19949)|
| 5:32:33| but men and women do not live by bread alone, and we have to have the culture side, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19953)|
| 5:32:40| And I think sometimes that people don't always take that into consideration when they're planning budgets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19960)|
| 5:32:47| I know health is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19967)|
| 5:32:49| Food is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19969)|
| 5:32:51| Old age has needs that need to be met, and I'm getting there myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19971)|
| 5:32:56| But when you're figuring out where the money goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19976)|
| 5:33:00| try to remember that this would be a pretty sterile place to live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19980)|
| 5:33:05| no matter how good your health or how youthful you are, if there is no music,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19985)|
| 5:33:10| if there is no art, and if there's no support for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19990)|
| 5:33:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19994)|
| 5:33:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19995)|
| 5:33:18| I know Sandy Loy is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=19998)|
| 5:33:20| He wanted to have an opportunity to speak, and then we'll allow, if there's anybody else in the audience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20000)|
| 5:33:28| name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20008)|
| 5:33:31| This is Sandy Loy, 813 McKinley Point Lane, Knoxville, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20011)|
| 5:33:38| I appreciate you all letting me have a chance to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20018)|
| 5:33:44| I've sat here and listened to a lot of the non-profits talk about taking these budget cuts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20024)|
| 5:33:49| and I know it's a tough year for everybody, whether you're private or public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20029)|
| 5:33:53| Along those lines, you know, Will Rogers one time said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20033)|
| 5:33:57| it's easy to be a gentleman when you've got a dollar in your pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20037)|
| 5:33:59| And I know you guys are faced with the tough challenge of deciding who's going to get what and who isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20039)|
| 5:34:04| If you've got plenty of money, you'll be a good guy to everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20044)|
| 5:34:08| What I'd like to submit to you here today is the fact that I think we waste enough money that could be saved by a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20048)|
| 5:34:15| of really good, smart decisions that could let us be a good guy in a lot more cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20055)|
| 5:34:21| and we wouldn't have to be worried about tens of thousands of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20061)|
| 5:34:23| I think we can save millions of dollars because of the fact that the way that we're going about building some of our public buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20063)|
| 5:34:32| I know this morning the Public Building Authority was being addressed here, and my name came up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20072)|
| 5:34:37| because I know I've sent all the commissioners should have received from me a package spelling out to you about some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20077)|
| 5:34:44| of the things I've been doing for the last few months addressing with the state legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20084)|
| 5:34:50| I've met with most of them in this area, and I've also met with Lieutenant Governor Ramsey to discuss what's been happening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20090)|
| 5:34:57| in our state as far as the public building authorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20097)|
| 5:34:59| It's not just Knox County, but there's nine across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20099)|
| 5:35:03| And I will tell you that the state of Tennessee operates differently than the other 49 states with respect to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20103)|
| 5:35:09| I'm not going to, I know you guys have been through a long day, so I'm not going to hammer you with a bunch of detailed information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20109)|
| 5:35:15| I will tell you I'd be glad to sit down with anybody at any time and go through as much detail as you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20115)|
| 5:35:21| But I will say this, I do have five or six points that I am going to hand out that I believe if these points were made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20121)|
| 5:35:29| in terms of the state law being ratified, amended, or whatever, clarified really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20129)|
| 5:35:35| because if you ask some three or four different lawyers, you get three or four different opinions about what the laws say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20135)|
| 5:35:40| because there's several of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20140)|
| 5:35:42| There's some conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20142)|
| 5:35:44| But all I know is the way things are being practiced and the way these laws are being applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20144)|
| 5:35:49| And we have a public building authority that is going into other counties and operating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20149)|
| 5:35:56| competing with private business from Knox County that is paying salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20156)|
| 5:36:02| They're going there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20162)|
| 5:36:03| As a nonprofit, that's an unfair advantage to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20163)|
| 5:36:07| And then to be competing with the constituents of Knox County who are businessmen and who are taxpayers, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20167)|
| 5:36:12| that's just wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20172)|
| 5:36:14| I think it's also wrong that you've got procurement law that's being ignored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20174)|
| 5:36:22| Bids are, you know, the word bid is a big word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20182)|
| 5:36:25| That's a big three-letter word because people use the word bid to mean about a hundred different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20185)|
| 5:36:31| What you all probably have in your mind is what bidding means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20191)|
| 5:36:36| It's probably what, you know, most people on the street think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20196)|
| 5:36:40| But it's not the way it actually is going down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20200)|
| 5:36:43| There's bids being open to private, bids that are not really bids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20203)|
| 5:36:48| There's no numbers involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20208)|
| 5:36:49| It's just a matter of somebody presenting their qualifications and then being selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20209)|
| 5:36:55| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20215)|
| 5:36:56| And we're wasting a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20216)|
| 5:36:58| And, for example, I can tell you the Hardin Valley School probably cost this county $10 to $15 million more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20218)|
| 5:37:04| in my opinion, than it should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20224)|
| 5:37:06| And I've built 10 schools in the last seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20226)|
| 5:37:09| Any other questions I can answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20229)|
| 5:37:12| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20232)|
| 5:37:14| Yes, Andy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20234)|
| 5:37:15| This morning, Dale Smith, when I think it was Commissioner Norman asked him about the letters that you had sent out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20235)|
| 5:37:24| and things, he basically said he had never seen it and said he had heard a little bit of something about it on blogs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20244)|
| 5:37:32| And I'm wondering, have you sent that stuff to him at the PBA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20252)|
| 5:37:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20255)|
| 5:37:36| I've made several calls to the PBA when this became my first of my knowledge several years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20256)|
| 5:37:43| And I've just met at a dead end street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20263)|
| 5:37:47| And, I mean, he said he had never heard of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20267)|
| 5:37:49| And I think that most of us in this room, you know, most people in this courthouse know you quite well from, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20269)|
| 5:37:56| from things you've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20276)|
| 5:37:59| And, you know, you're a highly respected business person in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20279)|
| 5:38:03| You know, I hear your commercials on News Talk Radio, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20283)|
| 5:38:09| and it's just you've done some phenomenal projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20289)|
| 5:38:12| And I was a little shocked that he said he had never heard of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20292)|
| 5:38:16| and that he hadn't seen the letters that you had sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20296)|
| 5:38:20| Of course, then he proceeded to respond to each point that was made in the letters that he has never seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20300)|
| 5:38:27| But just to be sure that he has seen these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20307)|
| 5:38:32| would you be willing to box up a packet and send it to him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20312)|
| 5:38:36| and perhaps certified mail might be a good way to send it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20316)|
| 5:38:40| I'd be glad to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20320)|
| 5:38:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20322)|
| 5:38:43| I've got, you know, what I've got is I've got a, you know, I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20323)|
| 5:38:47| My point here, Chairman Luthold, is that what I'd like to ask the commission to consider doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20327)|
| 5:38:54| and I know that because we're in this budgetary process, now's the time, if we can save money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20334)|
| 5:38:59| I think it's obviously a prudent thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20339)|
| 5:39:02| What I would like to propose to the commission is just because we have a state law that is flawed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20342)|
| 5:39:08| and poorly worded and has a loophole in it, doesn't mean it has to be abused and taken advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20348)|
| 5:39:14| And just because it may take me another year or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20354)|
| 5:39:16| and I'm convinced that we'll get this statute straightened out eventually, but it may take a year or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20356)|
| 5:39:22| And during that period of time, though, we're still wasting money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20362)|
| 5:39:24| What I'd like to ask the commission to consider at some point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20364)|
| 5:39:27| and I'll offer my services free of charge to help in any way I can in terms of being a consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20367)|
| 5:39:32| or meeting with workshops, is that to put forth some sort of an ordinance to clarify the way Knox County operates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20372)|
| 5:39:40| with our PBA in the meantime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20380)|
| 5:39:43| It could be very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20383)|
| 5:39:45| And I don't think that what I'm proposing is things like let's publicly open bids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20385)|
| 5:39:52| let's publicly advertise all the projects that are out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20392)|
| 5:39:56| let's don't allow our PBA to compete with private business that are taken away from our taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20396)|
| 5:40:02| And if they're not doing it, then it shouldn't bother them to have it clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20402)|
| 5:40:06| And if they are doing it, then it sure doesn't do nothing but save us money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20406)|
| 5:40:10| So I'm going to leave with you all my list of the same thing I've given the state senators about trying to get this clarified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20410)|
| 5:40:16| and hope that you all will consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20416)|
| 5:40:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20418)|
| 5:40:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20419)|
| 5:40:21| Is there anybody else in the audience who would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20421)|
| 5:40:26| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20426)|
| 5:40:27| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20427)|
| 5:40:29| We've got one over here, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20429)|
| 5:40:30| Okay, we've got two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20430)|
| 5:40:32| She can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20432)|
| 5:40:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20433)|
| 5:40:38| If you'll give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20438)|
| 5:40:41| Janet Truitt, 1537 Frosty Way, 98.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20441)|
| 5:40:48| I moved from Seattle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20448)|
| 5:40:49| 37912.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20449)|
| 5:40:51| I don't believe that anybody has mentioned the job that the community development group did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20451)|
| 5:40:59| getting the citizens review panels organized and just on track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20459)|
| 5:41:08| They did a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20468)|
| 5:41:10| I served on the panel for social services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20470)|
| 5:41:14| My recommendation to you all is that with the amount of work that all of us did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20474)|
| 5:41:21| please accept our recommendations as they stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20481)|
| 5:41:26| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20486)|
| 5:41:27| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20487)|
| 5:41:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20489)|
| 5:41:32| Name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20492)|
| 5:41:34| Kathy Bryant, 4100 Baja, BAJO Lane in Powell, Tennessee, 37849.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20494)|
| 5:41:42| I served on the youth services panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20502)|
| 5:41:47| And I guess in listening today, I have just some observations I'd like to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20507)|
| 5:41:52| First, I believe that the process was very fair this year, even more so than last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20512)|
| 5:41:58| and I believe that the people that put that together gave us very specific guidelines to go by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20518)|
| 5:42:05| in order to look at these organizations and agencies that are wanting funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20525)|
| 5:42:10| And I think that it was a very fair process and one that we couldn't stray from too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20530)|
| 5:42:17| We had to pay very close attention to certain factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20537)|
| 5:42:21| and things that these agencies were supposed to do in order to get to the point that they could speak to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20541)|
| 5:42:28| and share with us what they were doing and what they were asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20548)|
| 5:42:32| So I hope that you take that into consideration as you're looking at what we've recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20552)|
| 5:42:38| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20558)|
| 5:42:40| I think that the gal that spoke about looking at the funds that are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20560)|
| 5:42:46| is an extremely important thing to do with limited funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20566)|
| 5:42:50| When there's limited funds, I think you look at things slightly differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20570)|
| 5:42:53| You realize that there are some agencies that do not have resources that other agencies have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20573)|
| 5:42:58| And in not having those resources and their limited funds available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20578)|
| 5:43:03| how can we best spread those funds in the community since this is a community grant process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20583)|
| 5:43:08| What's the best way to spend those funds and how can we do that and be fair about how we do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20588)|
| 5:43:13| And I think that I can only speak to our group, to the youth services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20593)|
| 5:43:17| but I believe that all seven of us looked very carefully at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20597)|
| 5:43:21| and tried to really match these agencies and say these are smaller agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20601)|
| 5:43:28| or these are agencies that have limited resources and they probably need the funds more than some agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20608)|
| 5:43:34| that have a lot more resources available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20614)|
| 5:43:37| That is something that I certainly looked at and feels very important when you're saying it's a community grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20617)|
| 5:43:42| When you look at the process that was put into place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20622)|
| 5:43:47| I personally believe that I would like to see you respect that and certainly not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20627)|
| 5:43:53| and I don't think you would do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20633)|
| 5:43:55| certainly not fund something that we've recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20635)|
| 5:43:58| But I also think that because there was a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20638)|
| 5:44:01| those that didn't follow that process should not necessarily be rewarded for not following it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20641)|
| 5:44:06| And I don't, you know, that may sound mean and ugly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20646)|
| 5:44:09| and it may sound like I don't care about Second Harvest Food Bank, which I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20649)|
| 5:44:14| or any other agency that's come before you that didn't get any funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20654)|
| 5:44:18| But some of them may not have followed the process and if they didn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20658)|
| 5:44:22| I don't think that it's fair to reward them for not following it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20662)|
| 5:44:26| So that's something that I would love for you to at least think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20666)|
| 5:44:30| And then, let's see, I made some notes because I didn't want to forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20670)|
| 5:44:36| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20676)|
| 5:44:37| You've got one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20677)|
| 5:44:38| I've got one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20678)|
| 5:44:41| Oh, the last thing I'd like to say is, and I can't even read my notes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20681)|
| 5:44:44| is that, you know, we voted you, and I'm speaking as a citizen, to be good stewards of our tax money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20684)|
| 5:44:52| So I trust that each of you will do that in this budget process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20692)|
| 5:44:57| and be good stewards of the money that belongs to all of us, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20697)|
| 5:45:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20701)|
| 5:45:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20702)|
| 5:45:03| Hey, Kathy, did anybody in your last statement, you said not for us not to fund it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20703)|
| 5:45:08| or somebody that, did you all approve any money where people didn't follow the rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20708)|
| 5:45:13| Did we approve any money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20713)|
| 5:45:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20715)|
| 5:45:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20716)|
| 5:45:17| No, we did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20717)|
| 5:45:18| So we shouldn't, from any of the, if they didn't follow the rules, they should be out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20718)|
| 5:45:21| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20721)|
| 5:45:22| You heard Chuck make comments about people that didn't follow rules and how, I mean, I feel the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20722)|
| 5:45:27| Did you see the list of rewards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20727)|
| 5:45:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20729)|
| 5:45:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20730)|
| 5:45:31| Did anybody that you see didn't follow the rules get money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20731)|
| 5:45:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20734)|
| 5:45:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20735)|
| 5:45:36| Not now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20736)|
| 5:45:37| I only can speak to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20737)|
| 5:45:38| Youth services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20738)|
| 5:45:39| Youth services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20739)|
| 5:45:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20740)|
| 5:45:42| In fact, I will say, I will say that it was very interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20742)|
| 5:45:45| You know, we had, it was rankings, and there were numbers put together, and you guys have seen those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20745)|
| 5:45:50| And it was very interesting to see how most of us, the people that got money, were in our top 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20750)|
| 5:45:57| For most of us, they were the ones that we wanted to see get money, and they got money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20757)|
| 5:46:02| And so that said, the process worked very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20762)|
| 5:46:06| If we had all been across the board or out there doing weird stuff and our numbers hadn't matched as well as they did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20766)|
| 5:46:12| it would be paused to look at the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20772)|
| 5:46:16| But we were close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20776)|
| 5:46:18| We were close in a lot of ways with a lot of the agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20778)|
| 5:46:21| And that was an honor and a privilege, and I have to say that it was one of the hardest things I've ever done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20781)|
| 5:46:27| And it was a great joy to be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20787)|
| 5:46:29| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20789)|
| 5:46:30| I know I've gone over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20790)|
| 5:46:32| Commissioner Burwells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20792)|
| 5:46:34| I just had a general question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20794)|
| 5:46:36| Is there any way that we can get a list of which organizations didn't follow the proper procedures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20796)|
| 5:46:42| Eric, could you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20802)|
| 5:46:44| Could you just provide that to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20804)|
| 5:46:49| Yeah, we'll get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20809)|
| 5:46:50| But like she was saying, if they weren't on any one of these five sheets that you received, they didn't follow the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20810)|
| 5:46:58| Some rule is they didn't meet the get application turned in on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20818)|
| 5:47:02| They didn't make the mandatory meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20822)|
| 5:47:04| Or they get a grant right now in this fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20824)|
| 5:47:08| but they're not complying with the adoptive process that you all passed back in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20828)|
| 5:47:14| So what you're saying is that everyone who followed the rules got some money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20834)|
| 5:47:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20839)|
| 5:47:20| Everybody that is on this list were considered for money that followed the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20840)|
| 5:47:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20845)|
| 5:47:26| Anybody who didn't follow the rules weren't even considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20846)|
| 5:47:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20848)|
| 5:47:29| I want a list of the people who didn't follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20849)|
| 5:47:31| I'll get that to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20851)|
| 5:47:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20852)|
| 5:47:34| Anybody else want to come before the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20854)|
| 5:47:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20857)|
| 5:47:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20858)|
| 5:47:42| Last thing on our list on our agenda today is discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20862)|
| 5:47:49| Is there anything anybody would like to bring up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20869)|
| 5:47:52| We could discuss adjournment and scheduling another meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20872)|
| 5:47:55| Well, that's actually what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20875)|
| 5:47:57| I had suggested that prior to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20877)|
| 5:47:59| Well, yes, that's what I was going to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20879)|
| 5:48:01| Is now a good time to schedule the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20881)|
| 5:48:03| Because I don't think we're in a position to discuss at this point mentally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20883)|
| 5:48:10| Well, we've learned some things today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20890)|
| 5:48:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20892)|
| 5:48:13| So give us time maybe to digest them and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20893)|
| 5:48:15| And I'm in agreement with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20895)|
| 5:48:18| I had suggested earlier that it might be appropriate to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20898)|
| 5:48:24| and we may do this at the committee level or at the full commission meeting later this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20904)|
| 5:48:30| but I think that we need to consider the budget and the other budgetary items at special called meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20910)|
| 5:48:42| And whether we do that prior to this month's regular meeting or after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20922)|
| 5:48:51| it doesn't make any difference to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20931)|
| 5:48:53| Do we have to approve the budget twice or just once?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20933)|
| 5:48:56| Just once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20936)|
| 5:48:57| We need to find out when the room is available, too, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20937)|
| 5:49:00| Well, we can find that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20940)|
| 5:49:02| We definitely need to have a discussion before we vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20942)|
| 5:49:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20945)|
| 5:49:06| And, you know, normally my time here we've never voted on the budget until June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20946)|
| 5:49:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20950)|
| 5:49:13| Well, right now the budget and the other items, such as the tax rate, the capital plan, the bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20953)|
| 5:49:19| all of that is on this month's budget or, I mean, this month's agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20959)|
| 5:49:24| And it might be that we want to defer those once we get into a meeting that we can defer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20964)|
| 5:49:34| and we can't defer them at this meeting until in call on for maybe a special meeting maybe the first part of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20974)|
| 5:49:47| Yeah, that's what I was going to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20987)|
| 5:49:49| Is there a way for us to tentatively set maybe the next Monday, June 1st, or Tuesday, June 2nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20989)|
| 5:49:54| and reserve that time pending scheduling of rooms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20994)|
| 5:49:59| And, I mean, we have a majority here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=20999)|
| 5:50:03| There's a lot of things in this budget I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21003)|
| 5:50:06| And I'm not trying to rush anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21006)|
| 5:50:08| I'm just trying to take the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21008)|
| 5:50:11| Well, it's going to be up for a vote at this month's meeting, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21011)|
| 5:50:15| It is on the regular agenda for this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21015)|
| 5:50:18| So it would be prudent to have another discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21018)|
| 5:50:20| The only way we can, if we wanted to tonight, we could probably set another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21020)|
| 5:50:27| We could probably set a special called meeting, but we can't vote on anything as far as the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21027)|
| 5:50:35| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21035)|
| 5:50:36| So theoretically we could pull those things off the agenda for the May meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21036)|
| 5:50:41| We can't do that here, but we could do that at committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21041)|
| 5:50:43| At committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21043)|
| 5:50:44| And then we could schedule a special call meeting pending everything else for that next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21044)|
| 5:50:52| and discuss those at the time and then vote on them at the June meeting, I guess is what Commissioner thinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21052)|
| 5:50:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21057)|
| 5:50:58| Does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21058)|
| 5:50:59| And if you want to direct me to come up with a date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21059)|
| 5:51:04| About that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21064)|
| 5:51:05| About that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21065)|
| 5:51:06| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21066)|
| 5:51:07| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21067)|
| 5:51:10| If we have, okay, let's say we meet in June, and amazingly so, we can't come to an agreement of ten votes on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21070)|
| 5:51:17| What do we do if we get into July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21077)|
| 5:51:21| It has to be passed by, well, by June 30th before July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21081)|
| 5:51:28| So we meet until it's passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21088)|
| 5:51:30| We meet until it's passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21090)|
| 5:51:31| Every five days there will be a special call meeting until it's passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21091)|
| 5:51:36| We'll do the twisting of arms, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21096)|
| 5:51:39| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21099)|
| 5:51:40| I believe Commissioner Lutho would have to start operating on last year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21100)|
| 5:51:44| Well, there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21104)|
| 5:51:46| I mean, obviously if we don't pass it before July 1, government needs to continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21106)|
| 5:51:52| We have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21112)|
| 5:51:54| You'd have a contingency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21114)|
| 5:51:55| If nothing else, we have emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21115)|
| 5:51:58| We've got prisoners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21118)|
| 5:52:01| We need to continue to have the deputies out on patrol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21121)|
| 5:52:06| Do we need to start earlier than the first week of June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21126)|
| 5:52:09| It depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21129)|
| 5:52:10| I mean, it's up to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21130)|
| 5:52:12| I'm just making a suggestion that we should have a special call meeting to actually vote on the budget and those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21132)|
| 5:52:20| If we want to have another hearing to discuss it further, I think that's a good idea as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21140)|
| 5:52:31| It is on this month's agenda, and we can discuss it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21151)|
| 5:52:36| But we already filled up a full meeting without something as big as the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21156)|
| 5:52:42| So let's have a meeting just to discuss one more time and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21162)|
| 5:52:48| If you want to say let's have a hearing maybe in another week or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21168)|
| 5:52:56| and then also have a special call meeting to vote on it the first week of June, is that your suggestion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21176)|
| 5:53:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21183)|
| 5:53:04| How about following either the Finance Committee or the Intergovernmental Committee meetings next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21184)|
| 5:53:09| Well, we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21189)|
| 5:53:11| I would just like an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21191)|
| 5:53:12| I mean, we've heard from everybody today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21192)|
| 5:53:14| I would like an opportunity for the commissioners to sit together and discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21194)|
| 5:53:22| Yeah, and here's the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21202)|
| 5:53:24| If we schedule a workshop and then magically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21204)|
| 5:53:29| Don't say that next to Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21209)|
| 5:53:31| Today's a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21211)|
| 5:53:32| You've already got me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21212)|
| 5:53:34| Then magically we come up with consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21214)|
| 5:53:38| We can't vote on it if we schedule a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21218)|
| 5:53:42| If we go ahead and schedule a special call meeting, then if we can reach consensus after some deliberation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21222)|
| 5:53:49| then we can go ahead and vote on the budget and we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21229)|
| 5:53:52| If we can't reach consensus, if we need to discuss it more, then we can call another special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21232)|
| 5:54:00| But if we call it as a special call meeting, then we will have the opportunity to vote should we choose to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21240)|
| 5:54:07| And there's nothing saying that we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21247)|
| 5:54:10| But that's my problem with scheduling a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21250)|
| 5:54:13| That works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21253)|
| 5:54:15| The only problem that we have with that that I can think of, and, John, I'll get to you in just a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21255)|
| 5:54:22| by our own commission rules, and I know that we sort of stray from them a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21262)|
| 5:54:28| but our own rules say that we're not to discuss an item until a motion has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21268)|
| 5:54:35| And so really to even get into a workshop type of discussion of the budget, the tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21275)|
| 5:54:44| everything else that would be on that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21284)|
| 5:54:49| someone would have to make a motion technically in order for us to just really get into discussing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21289)|
| 5:54:54| if it is a special call meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21294)|
| 5:54:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21297)|
| 5:54:58| I mean, what we could do is have a, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21298)|
| 5:55:00| workshop followed by a special call meeting back-to-back, immediately following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21300)|
| 5:55:07| And then if we could have our hearing, workshop, whatever you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21307)|
| 5:55:15| and then immediately go into a special call meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21315)|
| 5:55:18| and if at that time we don't have a consensus or can't pass something, then obviously we could adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21318)|
| 5:55:26| We could adjourn and set another date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21326)|
| 5:55:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21331)|
| 5:55:32| Commissioner Lutho, now we have to give, what, a seven-day notice on a special call meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21332)|
| 5:55:37| It's something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21337)|
| 5:55:38| Five, I think, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21338)|
| 5:55:39| Seven, one of the two, I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21339)|
| 5:55:41| My suggestion would be the first week in June for us to have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21341)|
| 5:55:49| At the finance committee, we either vote to approve the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21349)|
| 5:55:54| intergovernmental at their meeting vote to approve the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21354)|
| 5:55:57| and then in June at the commission meeting we vote to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21357)|
| 5:56:00| I like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21360)|
| 5:56:04| Just go ahead and just do it in June?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21364)|
| 5:56:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21369)|
| 5:56:10| Have a discussion the first week in June on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21370)|
| 5:56:13| Then the finance committee, when they meet, they vote whether to vote it up or down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21373)|
| 5:56:18| recommend it or whatever, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21378)|
| 5:56:22| Intergovernmental will do the same thing on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21382)|
| 5:56:24| and then in June we either vote the budget in or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21384)|
| 5:56:28| So we will pull those things off of the May agenda, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21388)|
| 5:56:31| We'd have to pull them off at the finance and intergovernmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21391)|
| 5:56:36| Well, Mr. Chairman, that's the fourth Monday in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21396)|
| 5:56:41| which in case we start to have trouble coming up with ten votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21401)|
| 5:56:47| then we're starting to cut it close to July 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21407)|
| 5:56:51| That's right, Commissioner Lutho,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21411)|
| 5:56:53| but I believe if we don't reach an agreement on the budget that the charter says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21413)|
| 5:56:57| John can correct me on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21417)|
| 5:56:59| we operate on the existing budget right now until we reach an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21419)|
| 5:57:04| John, can you answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21424)|
| 5:57:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21426)|
| 5:57:07| Mr. Pinkston is correct about the charter and just for finance department in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21427)|
| 5:57:12| Our budget would be more if you don't act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21432)|
| 5:57:14| But we're asking you to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21434)|
| 5:57:18| That is the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21438)|
| 5:57:20| The school board has specifically asked us to ask you to act in May| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21440)|
| 5:57:25| so that they can get a budget finalized so they can hire their teachers, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21445)|
| 5:57:29| They don't feel comfortable putting those teachers under contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21449)|
| 5:57:33| until they have a budget in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21453)|
| 5:57:35| If we drag it out for another six or eight weeks or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21455)|
| 5:57:39| then that's just putting them back behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21459)|
| 5:57:42| Our different departments need to make plans for the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21462)|
| 5:57:45| and I don't think it serves much purpose in just delaying it to June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21465)|
| 5:57:50| I would suggest that let's have a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21470)|
| 5:57:52| and let's have the full day like Commissioner Lutho| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21472)|
| 5:57:56| sometime between committees and the full commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21476)|
| 5:57:58| We're ready to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21478)|
| 5:58:00| We're ready to sit down tomorrow with any of you if you have any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21480)|
| 5:58:03| We're ready to go over with Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21483)|
| 5:58:05| He's been to see the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21485)|
| 5:58:07| He's visited with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21487)|
| 5:58:08| He says he has more questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21488)|
| 5:58:10| I'm ready to sit down with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21490)|
| 5:58:12| We're ready to go on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21492)|
| 5:58:13| I'm ready to discuss right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21493)|
| 5:58:16| Well, I mean, we're still in a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21496)|
| 5:58:19| I mean, we can still discuss the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21499)|
| 5:58:21| The topic right now, we're just simply discussing how we want to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21501)|
| 5:58:26| If we want to have another hearing, do we want to have a special called meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21506)|
| 5:58:31| or do we just want to leave it on this month's agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21511)|
| 5:58:35| We can vote on it at committees and come in on, I guess it'll actually be Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21515)|
| 5:58:42| the day after Memorial Day, and just leave it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21522)|
| 5:58:46| I mean, that's still an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21526)|
| 5:58:48| I'm just saying I think that if we spend as much time on the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21528)|
| 5:58:54| as I think we'll spend on the budget trying to get it passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21534)|
| 5:58:58| along with everything else that's on the regular agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21538)|
| 5:59:02| we're going to be here for an awful long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21542)|
| 5:59:05| and I think it would serve us and the Knox County citizens best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21545)|
| 5:59:14| to have that separated out at a special meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21554)|
| 5:59:18| so we can devote all of our time and attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21558)|
| 5:59:21| when we're getting ready to vote on it, to just the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21561)|
| 5:59:25| It's the biggest thing we do every year is our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21565)|
| 5:59:31| And I think we need to have that day for just that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21571)|
| 5:59:40| Mr. Luthold, I agree with you in principle on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21580)|
| 5:59:44| What I don't understand, though, is why the body would not want to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21584)|
| 5:59:49| these already available committee meetings to do discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21589)|
| 5:59:57| and come to some decision within those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21597)|
| 6:00:00| We're already ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21600)|
| 6:00:02| We don't have any kind of publicity requirements there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21602)|
| 6:00:06| Why not use those and not exclude this most important topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21606)|
| 6:00:11| from the committee meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21611)|
| 6:00:13| And I'm not saying that we exclude it from those committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21613)|
| 6:00:16| I never suggested that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21616)|
| 6:00:18| I'm just saying we might want outside of a regular committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21618)|
| 6:00:22| and a regular commission meeting more time to devote to the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21622)|
| 6:00:29| Yeah, that would be fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21629)|
| 6:00:30| John, why, in the prior years before this year, we approved the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21630)|
| 6:00:37| and the school system was still hiring teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21637)|
| 6:00:39| What's the difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21639)|
| 6:00:41| They don't think that that's as ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21641)|
| 6:00:44| They feel like the other systems are able to make those commitments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21644)|
| 6:00:47| before our system makes those commitments in their pool of applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21647)|
| 6:00:51| If you get at the end of the hiring, the other systems have first choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21651)|
| 6:00:58| That's never been an issue before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21658)|
| 6:01:01| and I just wondered why all of a sudden it's become an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21661)|
| 6:01:04| It has been expressed to me before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21664)|
| 6:01:06| and it's been expressed specifically this year also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21666)|
| 6:01:10| And I'll also say that, according to the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21670)|
| 6:01:13| and looking at his numbers, he's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21673)|
| 6:01:15| They're not asking for much more than they did last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21675)|
| 6:01:18| and we're contractually obligated to give them what we gave them last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21678)|
| 6:01:23| So I don't see where this is holding up his process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21683)|
| 6:01:26| He knows he will get, or they know they will get X amount of millions of dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21686)|
| 6:01:31| and they can go forward and do all kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21691)|
| 6:01:34| There might be a little bit of a difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21694)|
| 6:01:36| but I guess what I'm saying is I don't want to be held up for that reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21696)|
| 6:01:42| and this is a new process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21702)|
| 6:01:44| I mean, I agree with Commissioner Pinkson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21704)|
| 6:01:46| Last year, my one data point, we didn't vote in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21706)|
| 6:01:53| Commissioner McKenzie, they didn't ask for any more than what we gave them last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21713)|
| 6:01:59| Really, we were giving them more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21719)|
| 6:02:00| They didn't ask for more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21720)|
| 6:02:02| But, you know, I don't understand that they didn't ask for any more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21722)|
| 6:02:07| but it just doesn't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21727)|
| 6:02:09| It seems to me like we're rushing this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21729)|
| 6:02:11| And I'm going to tell you, when we have this discussion, and Commissioner McKenzie is new there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21731)|
| 6:02:16| he can tell you what we went through last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21736)|
| 6:02:18| and you're not going to be prepared to vote on it the day that we have the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21738)|
| 6:02:22| It will take you about a week to digest everything you've heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21742)|
| 6:02:26| Well, that's why I'd like to meet as soon as possible so I can begin digesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21746)|
| 6:02:30| But we all need to meet together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21750)|
| 6:02:32| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21752)|
| 6:02:33| Because you want to hear everything that everybody says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21753)|
| 6:02:36| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21756)|
| 6:02:37| And that's why I said we should have this meeting the 1st of June, the first meeting in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21757)|
| 6:02:43| and then we can talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21763)|
| 6:02:46| Yeah, but you only hear half the story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21766)|
| 6:02:49| Commissioner Saunders, you have your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21769)|
| 6:02:55| There's one component that we haven't talked anything about, and that's the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21775)|
| 6:02:58| I assume in all these meetings they will have their opportunity also to present whatever views they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21778)|
| 6:03:03| Obviously, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21783)|
| 6:03:05| As long as I'm chairing it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21785)|
| 6:03:09| I would prefer that we meet as soon as possible and discuss this thing fully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21789)|
| 6:03:14| I don't mind spending a day sometime in the balance of this month and get this on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21794)|
| 6:03:20| talk about it, and go ahead and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21800)|
| 6:03:22| But I agree with Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21802)|
| 6:03:23| We do need some time to digest it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21803)|
| 6:03:26| Well, that's why I was suggesting that we may have a hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21806)|
| 6:03:30| and then follow that up with a special call meeting a week or so later so that we have had a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21810)|
| 6:03:40| Can we just schedule a discussion for next week, like Wednesday or Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21820)|
| 6:03:47| Committees Monday and Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21827)|
| 6:03:49| We can either meet after a committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21829)|
| 6:03:51| We could meet on Wednesday or Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21831)|
| 6:03:53| Probably not on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21833)|
| 6:03:54| It's the last day of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21834)|
| 6:03:55| People are going to be going out of town for Memorial Day weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21835)|
| 6:03:59| But that would give us a long weekend to think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21839)|
| 6:04:02| Do we have the availability right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21842)|
| 6:04:07| You don't have it with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21847)|
| 6:04:09| You know, I guess I'm saying this committee meeting is next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21849)|
| 6:04:14| We're talking about not rushing, but we're rushing to have this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21854)|
| 6:04:18| We have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21858)|
| 6:04:19| I don't want to rush to vote, but I want to start discussing right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21859)|
| 6:04:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21863)|
| 6:04:24| And we can set a discussion item at the end for the regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21864)|
| 6:04:30| But what will happen is we, right now, we have a vote in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21870)|
| 6:04:36| If we leave it alone and have discussions next week, we will vote on the budget in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21876)|
| 6:04:42| That's rushing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21882)|
| 6:04:43| No, we don't have to vote on it in May if we discuss it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21883)|
| 6:04:46| Let's have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21886)|
| 6:04:47| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21887)|
| 6:04:48| What we can do is it's on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21888)|
| 6:04:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21891)|
| 6:04:52| And if this commission decides to come in at their committees and say, let's say finance comes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21892)|
| 6:05:00| we want to defer until either June or defer until a special called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21900)|
| 6:05:05| An intergovernmental could do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21905)|
| 6:05:09| Then, even if they say no recommendation, we could still come in that Tuesday, the full commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21909)|
| 6:05:17| and vote to defer until a special called meeting or defer it until the June regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21917)|
| 6:05:24| I mean, those are your options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21924)|
| 6:05:27| I'm just trying to throw out suggestions of having a public hearing so that we can discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21927)|
| 6:05:37| and then follow maybe sometime a week or so later with a special called meeting so that we can then vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21937)|
| 6:05:49| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21949)|
| 6:05:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21950)|
| 6:05:51| Commissioner McKenzie, you've sort of agreed with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21951)|
| 6:05:55| Why can't we just have the discussion at the regular commission meeting at the end of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21955)|
| 6:06:00| then us have a special called meeting the first week in June to vote on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21960)|
| 6:06:05| Well, that was the very first thing I said was to have a special called meeting in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21965)|
| 6:06:11| But if you so wish, we could have a hearing immediately following either one of the committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21971)|
| 6:06:22| So that way we've got too much on us with these committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21982)|
| 6:06:26| We cannot do the job for our committees, the finance committee and vote on these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21986)|
| 6:06:33| and then have a discussion right after that and absorb it all and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21993)|
| 6:06:38| Well, that's why I suggested a separate day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=21998)|
| 6:06:42| That's why I'm suggesting let's pull everything off, discuss it after the commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22002)|
| 6:06:47| and vote on it the first week in June, and that gives some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22007)|
| 6:06:52| So you're asking to have a special called meeting sometime the first week of June to vote on the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22012)|
| 6:06:58| And a discussion at the regular commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22018)|
| 6:07:01| I would rather not discuss it at the regular commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22021)|
| 6:07:03| Those things already last so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22023)|
| 6:07:05| If we tried to tack that on to the end, we'd be here all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22025)|
| 6:07:08| Everybody's blood sugar is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22028)|
| 6:07:10| They're grumpy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22030)|
| 6:07:11| Everybody needs to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22031)|
| 6:07:12| Well, then we can retreat to Craig's suggestion, which is on that same early June day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22032)|
| 6:07:17| have a workshop followed immediately by a special session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22037)|
| 6:07:21| Therefore, if people still feel the need to talk, we can do it in the workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22041)|
| 6:07:25| and if people are ready to vote, we can do it in the special session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22045)|
| 6:07:28| We put them together at the same date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22048)|
| 6:07:29| We do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22049)|
| 6:07:30| Everybody's happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22050)|
| 6:07:32| Amy, some of us have spent 16 hours up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22052)|
| 6:07:35| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22055)|
| 6:07:36| That comes with the job, really, and I'm not saying that to be smart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22056)|
| 6:07:38| but I've been up here at 10 and left at 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22058)|
| 6:07:41| Yeah, and nobody does their best work after that many hours in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22061)|
| 6:07:49| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22069)|
| 6:07:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22070)|
| 6:07:55| I think that it would make sense if we moved all the budget items for this next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22075)|
| 6:08:01| to the end of the agenda, took care of our agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22081)|
| 6:08:04| whatever time that we feel, however long we can discuss it on that Tuesday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22084)|
| 6:08:10| until it gets to the point where nobody's making sense or getting mad at each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22090)|
| 6:08:16| and then do what Commissioner Harmon suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22096)|
| 6:08:19| having a workshop and special called meeting on the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22099)|
| 6:08:22| That way, at the end of May's commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22102)|
| 6:08:29| we've had discussion for however many hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22109)|
| 6:08:32| and then we enter into a workshop the first week of June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22112)|
| 6:08:36| and then hopefully vote on the budget right after that workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22116)|
| 6:08:41| and a special called meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22121)|
| 6:08:42| That gives us a whole commission meeting we've had today, a whole commission meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22122)|
| 6:08:46| a workshop, and then a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22126)|
| 6:08:49| If we can't get it done, if we can't figure it out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22129)|
| 6:08:51| we're probably not going to figure it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22131)|
| 6:08:54| That would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22134)|
| 6:08:56| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22136)|
| 6:08:59| Could you recognize Mr. Troyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22139)|
| 6:09:03| John, do you have anything you'd like to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22143)|
| 6:09:06| We're ready to spend as much time with any of the commissioners that you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22146)|
| 6:09:11| You heard today the school board is happy with their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22151)|
| 6:09:13| They're the biggest piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22153)|
| 6:09:15| The sheriff is acceptable with his piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22155)|
| 6:09:17| That's the second biggest piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22157)|
| 6:09:18| Parks department are acceptable with their piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22158)|
| 6:09:20| Libraries are acceptable with their piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22160)|
| 6:09:22| Senior centers are acceptable with their piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22162)|
| 6:09:25| Parks and recreation are acceptable with their piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22165)|
| 6:09:27| Engineering and public works are acceptable with their piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22167)|
| 6:09:32| We're ready to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22172)|
| 6:09:34| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22174)|
| 6:09:36| But we've just now received the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22176)|
| 6:09:38| This has been the first time we've had to sit down and discuss it as a full body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22178)|
| 6:09:46| I don't want to speak for anybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22186)|
| 6:09:48| but it sounds to me that the members that are here are wanting a little more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22188)|
| 6:09:54| because we're the ones that have to approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22194)|
| 6:09:58| and we're the ones that have to go out there and face the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22198)|
| 6:10:02| and answer why did you vote for this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22202)|
| 6:10:07| So we're ready to go with your agenda, your schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22207)|
| 6:10:13| And now reclaiming the reserve of my time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22213)|
| 6:10:20| I agree with Commissioner Anders that we have a schedule before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22220)|
| 6:10:23| We have committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22223)|
| 6:10:25| We have the regular scheduled meeting of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22225)|
| 6:10:28| And to say that we can't do anything during those periods of time, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22228)|
| 6:10:32| would be counterproductive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22232)|
| 6:10:33| So I think that we ought to have the agenda that is set that is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22233)|
| 6:10:37| We ought to at least look at it and see how late in the day we get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22237)|
| 6:10:40| And if we find that we're uncomfortable with where we're at after committee meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22240)|
| 6:10:44| and after the next scheduled meeting of county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22244)|
| 6:10:47| it's all right for us to be in the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22247)|
| 6:10:49| But to say we can't get somewhere today, we can't say that because we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22249)|
| 6:11:00| Commissioner Boyles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22260)|
| 6:11:02| Sorry, I didn't mean to still have my line on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22262)|
| 6:11:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22264)|
| 6:11:05| No, I just enjoy getting together with you all so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22265)|
| 6:11:09| that I just want to do it as often as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22269)|
| 6:11:15| Why don't we have Jolie try to book this room for the second then of June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22275)|
| 6:11:21| for this meeting we're talking about and then do what we suggested here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22281)|
| 6:11:24| Do you need a motion for that or can we make a motion for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22284)|
| 6:11:28| Well, we can since we are at a public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22288)|
| 6:11:33| We can, I think, Jolie, correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22293)|
| 6:11:37| but I mean the law keeps changing on us here, how we even can set a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22297)|
| 6:11:44| If we decide to go ahead and have a second meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22304)|
| 6:11:50| then I think as long as there's ten of us here that say we want to have a special meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22310)|
| 6:11:54| at a Sunshine meeting, which we are in, then we can call for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22314)|
| 6:12:06| And Jolie agrees with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22326)|
| 6:12:08| I wish the law director was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22328)|
| 6:12:15| Seconds of Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22335)|
| 6:12:27| That's not going to work for me, but you all can do whatever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22347)|
| 6:12:31| My youngest son turns 16 Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22351)|
| 6:12:38| Monday the first works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22358)|
| 6:12:43| I'm out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22363)|
| 6:12:44| You're out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22364)|
| 6:12:45| How about Wednesday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22365)|
| 6:12:47| Out of town until Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22367)|
| 6:12:49| The second doesn't work for you either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22369)|
| 6:12:51| Would you be here for Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22371)|
| 6:12:56| Does the fourth work for people if this room is available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22376)|
| 6:13:03| Well, why don't we do on that date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22383)|
| 6:13:06| do we want to have a special called meeting to be able to take action on the budgetary items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22386)|
| 6:13:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22394)|
| 6:13:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22395)|
| 6:13:16| Do we want to just have that as a special called meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22396)|
| 6:13:21| Because as has been pointed out, we're going to have two committees meeting next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22401)|
| 6:13:29| We will also have the opportunity to discuss it on Tuesday at our full commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22409)|
| 6:13:37| and then we could come back, what, ten days later or so and then vote on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22417)|
| 6:13:42| if we don't pass it on our regular meeting on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22422)|
| 6:13:49| But we at least have that in our back pocket to have a special called meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22429)|
| 6:13:54| if it does not pass at this month's regular commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22434)|
| 6:13:59| Two o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22439)|
| 6:14:00| And do we want to start that at two o'clock or do we want to start a little earlier?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22440)|
| 6:14:05| It would be nice to start in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22445)|
| 6:14:07| I would suggest early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22447)|
| 6:14:08| How about ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22448)|
| 6:14:10| Eight thirty is bad for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22450)|
| 6:14:12| The morning is bad for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22452)|
| 6:14:15| How about ten o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22455)|
| 6:14:17| Or is that still too early?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22457)|
| 6:14:18| I'll be up then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22458)|
| 6:14:21| You've got to be somewhere at five thirty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22461)|
| 6:14:28| Ten o'clock work for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22468)|
| 6:14:30| Ten o'clock and I'll just come when I can and hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22470)|
| 6:14:34| Ten o'clock is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22474)|
| 6:14:35| Ten o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22475)|
| 6:14:36| Let's go with ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22476)|
| 6:14:37| Ten o'clock on the fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22477)|
| 6:14:39| We will set up, if this room is available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22479)|
| 6:14:42| a special call meeting to take action on all items that deal with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22482)|
| 6:14:46| That would be the budget, the tax rate, the capital plan, John, help me, what other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22486)|
| 6:14:56| I believe there's a bond issue that pertains to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22496)|
| 6:15:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22501)|
| 6:15:02| We can just call it all remaining unresolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22502)|
| 6:15:04| All items that deal with the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22504)|
| 6:15:11| Yeah, you could point it out and say that whatever is not passed at the May meeting is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22511)|
| 6:15:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22516)|
| 6:15:17| Well, I'll just put down that it's all items that deal with the budget that have not been passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22517)|
| 6:15:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22524)|
| 6:15:26| And as provided, this room is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22526)|
| 6:15:30| Move we adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22530)|
| 6:15:32| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22532)|
| 6:15:33| Thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom090512budgethearings?start=22533)|
