| 0:11:02| Do we have anybody signed up to speak for this measure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| No one has signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| I know some folks in the neighborhood are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| If anybody...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=669)|
| 0:11:10| Larry, do you want to speak to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=670)|
| 0:11:12| Or any of the neighbors that are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=672)|
| 0:11:15| Larry's a neighbor too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=675)|
| 0:11:17| I just want to mention that this is obviously just a resolution to let MPC study the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=677)|
| 0:11:22| bounded by those streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=682)|
| 0:11:25| I think some of the concerns are for the commercial district along Central, so Mr. Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=685)|
| 0:11:30| And welcome, former Councilman Larry Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=690)|
| 0:11:33| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=693)|
| 0:11:34| Please state your address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| When I read this, I looked at it, and it's got the commercial part of Central Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=696)|
| 0:11:41| from North Street all the way down to Woodland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=701)|
| 0:11:45| And if the commercial area is not going to be in the historic district, if it is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| historic district, I think we can pull it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| I know I talked to Attorney Frost there a minute ago, and he said you could actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| take it out right now, that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| You could put it to the line behind me, the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| I talked to her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| She knows where that alley's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=721)|
| 0:12:03| If you take that out to North Street, straight through the alleyway between Oldham and Woodland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| then go up the alley and cut down through Neely and take the ones out on the east, north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| side of, business on the north side of Woodland, and it'll take all the business out of there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=733)|
| 0:12:20| And I think, I don't know, you'd be happy with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| Well, I feel like, Larry, that those concerns will be hashed out when we sit around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=743)|
| 0:12:29| table at the Planning Commission and take a look with Jeff Archer and others that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| going to give us an idea on where we want to draw those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| I mean, I'm not opposed to that if we want to do that right now, but I figure there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| no serious concern about anything happening right at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=760)|
| 0:12:45| I was on council 20 years, and I found that if you get it off on the front end, you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=765)|
| 0:12:49| better off on the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| Well, I respectfully understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Could, maybe, Deb, do you want to say a few words?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=773)|
| 0:12:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| State your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| Deborah Thomas, 428 East Burwell, and I believe Larry lives on Churchwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=782)|
| 0:13:06| I was going to ask him, he forgot to give me your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| He's 124, Churchwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| Our concern is mainly for the down zoning and for the single family houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=793)|
| 0:13:18| There's really not much single family housing left on Central Street at this point, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| Larry's referring to a service alley that runs parallel to Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=803)|
| 0:13:29| So the houses all end kind of right there at that alley, but we have no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=809)|
| 0:13:34| We kind of felt like it was just a study and that MPC would finalize it after they got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| done with the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=817)|
| 0:13:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=820)|
| 0:13:41| Yeah, I wonder, I'm trying to figure out what the best course of procedure here is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=821)|
| 0:13:48| Obviously, you guys can make a written submission to MPC telling them that those are areas of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=828)|
| 0:13:56| special interest you want to exclude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| I don't guess there's any problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| The second way would be for us to say, giving special attention to the exclusion of commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| zones in the particular alley, but I don't know how to describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| I mean, we could just, I don't want to tie MPC's hands, I want them to do a good job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| reviewing this, but we could just say pay special attention to possible exclusion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| those two areas and that, would you want to make that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Well, we have the west side, we say, bounded on the west by Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| Can you possibly say, bounded on the west by the service alley that's immediately parallel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| to Central Street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| And the two parts of Woodland Avenue, 100, 200, of Woodland on the north end side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=879)|
| 0:14:47| That should take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| It gets confusing, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| I don't think those are contributing, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| Councilman Greer, do you want to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| Go ahead, and then Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Her light was on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| Okay, Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=899)|
| 0:15:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=900)|
| 0:15:02| I really think we need to send the resolution to MPC as it is drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=902)|
| 0:15:07| Larry, I know you were on council at a different time, and I think, hopefully MPC works a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=907)|
| 0:15:13| differently now, but I really think that those concerns need to go to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=913)|
| 0:15:18| We need to send this as it's drafted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| Let MPC address it, let the neighborhood deal with it, and then I feel confident that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=921)|
| 0:15:27| the right thing will be done, rather than us to start tampering with it tonight when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=927)|
| 0:15:32| most of us can't tell you exactly where these streets and alleys are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| It would be up an alley without a paddle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| Councilman Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| I mean, Vice Mayor Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| Larry, several of us have been through this process, especially while we were on Historic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| Zoning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Rob has been through it, Ben Barr has been through it, and I've been through it, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| I agree with my colleague that we ought to go ahead and let MPC do their job, and what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=952)|
| 0:16:00| happening, there's going to be public meetings, there'll be plenty of public input from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| neighborhood, and as I said, we've been through several of these, and even though we've set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| up certain boundaries that we wanted to see, by the time it came back, with all the input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| with the neighborhoods and this sort of thing, it really worked itself out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| I understand what you're saying, and I appreciate that, but I also think that we ought to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| go ahead and approve what the resolution is, and as Ms. Palmer said, let MPC work, let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| the neighborhoods, the commercial folks, all come together and really work together to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=989)|
| 0:16:34| determine what is going to be the overlay in that particular area on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| So I really support the resolution as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=998)|
| 0:16:43| Mr. Kelly is here and has heard the whole conversation, so do you want to speak to that, Mr. Kelly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1003)|

| 0:18:47| This project is something we obviously want to go forward, but I know that there's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| to be some delays with relationship to TDOT's need to access the area during the Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1131)|

| 0:19:13| It will be complete, totally complete before TDOT starts their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1153)|

| 0:19:26| Is it the ramps or what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1166)|
| 0:19:28| Well, there's several projects in that area and you might address some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1168)|

| 0:20:28| When TDOT moves forward with the Broadway Viaduct project, I believe some of that staging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1228)|
| 0:20:33| may occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1233)|

| 0:25:02| and also the revenue sharing has increased by 15% for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1502)|
| 0:25:08| And their change-outs is at their expense, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| We're not paying for the equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| They incur the cost and then we get this percentage return in essence on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| Yeah, we get a 35% return at no cost to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| They maintain cameras and all the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1530)|
| 0:25:31| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| It wasn't quick enough, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| I didn't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| I think I've had several telephone calls about the process that they go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| Would you just go through the fact that once the camera takes the picture, then what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1543)|
| 0:25:48| involvement of our city police are in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| Yeah, once the camera takes the picture, the vendor reviews the video initially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| If they see a violation, it is then sent to the police department where a police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1555)|
| 0:26:00| reviews the footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| And if the police officer agrees that there was a violation, then a citation is issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1561)|
| 0:26:07| But it is not issued until an officer has reviewed it and has seen the violation for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| him or herself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| And it's only for running stops, or only running the red light, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| It's not on the right turn anymore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| So they screen the whole pool and get down to the ones that need review by police?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Do we use the cameras for any other purpose besides traffic enforcement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1588)|
| 0:26:37| Cameras are there, but they're very narrowly focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| So not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| We've not had much luck gleaning any more footage off of them than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| But if you're looking for like a white truck, can you use the cameras to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| Yes, you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1608)|
| 0:26:50| And the way it takes pictures is the pictures are taken at the notice of a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1610)|
| 0:26:55| So the infraction triggers the camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| So if they're obeying the law, then the footage may not be usable or accessible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1619)|
| 0:27:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1627)|

| 0:27:42| Councilman Delivanti?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| Yeah, Dawn, Michelle, maybe you can just fill us in on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1663)|
| 0:27:47| The main buildings are being occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| I see the streetscapes with the cutouts and stuff for parking and trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| Are they going to start a project on that second segment that's, what, the south side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1675)|
| 0:28:01| of the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| Is that in the works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1682)|

| 0:28:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| Oh, as far as Mauville Alley, I think, I can't speak for the developer, but I think they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| did go through county commission for something a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| In regards to the streetscape project, this was just for some conflicts with utilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| where we had to redesign and have the contractor do some additional work to get up under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| utilities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1703)|
| 0:28:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1704)|
| 0:28:25| And it was torn up for a while, but you've got at least the base code and maybe the final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| code on it now, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| And we also had to extend the date of completion as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| Excuse me, Councilman, to answer your question, they did go to county commission for a pilot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| For the second phase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| For the second phase, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1722)|
| 0:28:43| And how many units will be in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| Not offhand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1729)|

| 0:29:43| but not at this meeting, and just a sense of where you're going and why you're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1788)|
| 0:29:49| Chad Weath, Public Service Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| Well, this is kind of step one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1791)|
| 0:29:52| We're hoping to bring this to you all today, and on the 11th, we hope to bring forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| a contract for a new garbage hauler that will take place on beginning January 1 of 2017,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1797)|
| 0:30:04| and also for marketing outreach education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| Obviously, we can't give everybody a cart and expect them to know what to do with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| so there will also be a major education component that will be brought to you guys at the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| All right, but as I understood it when you explained it at one point, you're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1817)|
| 0:30:21| get carts, you're going to purchase carts, distribute them to homeowners, and sort of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| what, standardize the pickup aspect so that it will cut costs in handling garbage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1827)|
| 0:30:33| Would you tell us just briefly what that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| Yeah, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1835)|
| 0:30:36| We've actually, we went out for RFP with the hope that we would have a standardized garbage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1836)|
| 0:30:42| cart, a 95-gallon garbage cart, for all residents starting January 1, so the savings that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| come from having the carts is what will be brought to Council at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1848)|
| 0:30:55| But without the carts, the savings from the garbage hauling doesn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1855)|
| 0:31:01| But it will eventually pay for itself by reducing the handling costs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| It will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| We anticipate, based on the costs that we're reviewing, of saving $2 million a year, roughly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| on the hauling contract, so that in turn will have the carts paid off in about 18 to 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1869)|
| 0:31:13| months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| Just so I haven't confused anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1875)|
| 0:31:16| So, we're managing the budget to be able to do that if we so choose in a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1876)|
| 0:31:21| That is correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1882)|

| 0:32:20| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| Councilman Della Voti?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Yeah, I was a little slow on the uptake on pushing that, but both of these are related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1943)|
| 0:32:27| and I'm just curious how we got to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1947)|
| 0:32:32| What was happening that caused the concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| Maybe Brenda Palmer can just give us a little background on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| I'd like Mr. Frost to take the ball on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| Briefly, the law department, police department, and I, you know, for years, if not decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1962)|
| 0:32:50| have, when someone wants to give beer away, no charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| No charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| Well, sometimes they do charge, but they don't call it a charge for the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| But you have to have a permit, and some folks honestly got confused, and we're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| clarify that, because when somebody comes for a beer permit, you know, they go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| the task class, they, you know, have server training, they have compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| All the precautions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1996)|
| 0:33:17| All the precautions to prevent sales to minors and other improper activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=1997)|
| 0:33:20| Sales are given away to minors, you know, learn about underage drinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2000)|
| 0:33:25| So we're really just clarifying it so we're better in position to enforce improper...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2005)|
| 0:33:31| Well, it will be enforced, but it, you know, it's more, I guess, consumer-friendly to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2011)|
| 0:33:38| with the understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2018)|
| 0:33:40| It doesn't apply to private events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2020)|
| 0:33:42| It does not apply to private events, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| So Mark's birthday, we can, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| You don't need a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2027)|
| 0:33:50| No permit for Mark, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| No comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| Okay, so any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2039)|
| 0:34:01| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| Council, that's the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| We had one person sign up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2044)|
| 0:34:10| Did you want to sign up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Okay, come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| Let me first say Rhonda Gallman, I do not believe she's here, is she?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2052)|
| 0:34:16| I can't see her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| Okay, so Mr. Tate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2058)|
| 0:34:26| Thanks for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| Mr. Tate, your name and address for the record, and as you know, I set the timer for five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2072)|
| 0:34:33| My name's Alan Tate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| I live at 3617 Escagna Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| I'm also the owner of the French Market Restaurant, 526 South Gay Street, and I'm here to talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2075)|
| 0:34:43| about the wall in front of our restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| Some of you guys, ladies and gentlemen, have received emails from me over the last couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| of weeks about this and some other issues regarding Dover development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2090)|
| 0:34:53| I brought packages for you with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| Can I pass these out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Like eight of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2098)|
| 0:34:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Don, Michelle, could you grab that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Will will get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| So these are some photographs of the space showing my space versus Dover development space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2103)|
| 0:35:10| in the same building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| Just the boarded up front that sort of hides your business right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| 17 weeks we've had this in front of us, 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2115)|
| 0:35:19| And I talked to Rick Emmett about it, and he said he would never have approved it the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| way it's designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| It has no roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| It has no safety features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2125)|
| 0:35:27| It's just an intimidation by the landlord against us because we're in a dispute over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| the term of my lease and the terms of what he wants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| And I don't think it should be allowed to have walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| I don't have a problem with a roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| If he wants a safety structure above it, that's fine, but it doesn't need to have walls impeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| our view out or for customers to see us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2144)|
| 0:35:47| I mean, David Dewhurst has built walls in downtown, and you can walk under them, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2147)|
| 0:35:53| you can see what's going on, and you can see the street, and you're protected from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2157)|
| 0:35:58| This one has no roof, and it's a sloped roof to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| So if something did fall, it would bounce across and right onto the sidewalk anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| so it serves no purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| And second of all, there's a tunnel that we have to go through, and our handicapped customers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| can barely make it in between Cool Auto Gelato and our space due to this tunnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| It meets code as three feet wide, but it's really not three feet wide enough when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| have customers in line to get into our restaurant, somebody's in a wheelchair, we're a packed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| restaurant, you can't get in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| I think the whole thing needs to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| And we're asking to you guys to limit these developers from doing something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2190)|
| 0:36:34| Rick promised 30 days this would be up and out, maximum, and then we're 17 weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| It was put up the second week in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| And it serves no purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| He's not put one nail in, he hasn't started any construction, it's just there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| And I can't seem to get anybody to do anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| And I have another issue regarding, that several of you members know I've sent emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2210)|
| 0:36:54| to with regard to my utility service, that Rick is in charge of my utilities, since it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2214)|
| 0:37:00| was a hotel, I don't have separate meters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| He called code enforcement on us, had Peter Ahrens and Greg Taylor come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| He has a code violation with his electrical panel, which is my electrical panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| I don't have access to it on my back door, he sealed up my rear fire exit, so I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| no access to my electrical panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| The city says to have the electrical panel moved into my space, Rick Dover agreed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| do it, he changed his mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| We agreed to pay the $8,000 to move the electrical panel into our space, and now we've bought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2246)|
| 0:37:32| the equipment, we have the permit, we're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| We were supposed to do it last week and he's in France and is refusing to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| So we're also requesting time issued on Dover to continue to monitor the unit until we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| get it moved into our space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| I mean, we're a pioneering restaurant, we've been here nine years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| The Hyatt Regency and the Marriott and a lot of these other restaurants wouldn't be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| if it wasn't for eight or nine of us restaurants that took this gamble on downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| I don't think it's fair for us to be treated this way, and for you guys just to look the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| other way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2281)|
| 0:38:02| I mean, this is an eyesore on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| His little space looks great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| He's got a nice roof, it's painted, he's got pictures, and look at mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| I mean, I look like a war zone, and it's really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| You all need to figure out some way to do something about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2294)|
| 0:38:17| Second of all, I don't know if you did your due diligence on this guy, but we're involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2297)|
| 0:38:22| in a lawsuit and I've received due diligence from my attorneys and I've supplied it on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| to you that he has a checkered past in real estate development, he has a sketchy past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2307)|
| 0:38:33| with banks, a sketchy past with the government, a sketchy past with three different states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| and you all should do your due diligence before you give out TIF money to somebody like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| He can't be trusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2323)|
| 0:38:44| Everything he's told us is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| I mean, we've had nothing but go around for over a year with this guy, and we're at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2325)|
| 0:38:51| end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2331)|
| 0:38:52| But we need something done with this wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2332)|
| 0:38:53| You have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| So, that's where I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| We want you guys to try to figure out how to get this wall removed, have him reissue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2337)|
| 0:39:02| for a new permit that goes out to the sidewalk and a roof over the top of it so the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| can come through and see us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2346)|
| 0:39:08| I mean, our business is being wiped out by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2348)|
| 0:39:11| And it's partially your fault, because the IBD owns the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2351)|
| 0:39:15| You know, he's a property manager, developer, but it's the city that actually owns the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2355)|
| 0:39:20| So, that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2365)|
| 0:39:26| Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| Councilman Dallavanti?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| Can I ask Rick Emmett if he would step up for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| Rick, it's unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| I didn't realize that there was no roof on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2372)|
| 0:39:33| I always picture these structures as protecting the pedestrians from something falling out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| of a window and bouncing off their head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| What's the purpose of the structure at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| When he put the structure up, he was doing some work on the façade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| It was for safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2387)|
| 0:39:48| It was OSHA requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| My understanding is he's going to Downtown Design and Review for various issues and hasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| been able to get his approval to do the work he needs to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| Clearly, without the roof on the wall that Alan's talking about, it's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| I mean, I'm down there every day and see this, and I agree with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| It's a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2406)|
| 0:40:07| But there is a landlord-tenant dispute going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| There's a lawsuit filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| It's getting a little dicey as far as our involvement in some ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| Well, that's kind of a separate matter in my mind, the business dispute between the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| lessor and the lessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| But in terms of the structure that's in the public way, do we have any standards for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| Does codes deal with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| Who deals with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| City engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2431)|
| 0:40:32| They apply to city engineering for a temporary construction easement or permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2432)|
| 0:40:37| All construction like that occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| It's going on at the Crest Building and a couple other buildings downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| So we try to look at what they're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| We want him to build an overpass if it's going to be a pass-through, as Alan's suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| And that's what we suggested originally for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| But Dover thought that he could keep the sidewalk open by pushing it back to leave a five-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| opening, which is what he's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| His problem with the tunnel is that he didn't want folks confusing going to the French Market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| and wandering over into his construction area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| So he was trying to corral them into the French Market without actually coming over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| into his business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| And that made some sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| I talked to them about doing something similar to what Dewhurst did, and that is having some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| openings and some windows in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| And they tried to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| And you're not sure whether there's a business behind the wall or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| It's kind of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| It's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| And Dover agreed to put some signs up, and Alan's done that, that says the French Market's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2492)|
| 0:41:33| But it's a concern, and we'll talk to Mr. Dover about that some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| Thank you, Rick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2499)|
| 0:41:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| So, Ms. Gallman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| I don't think she has arrived.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| So, counsel, there's no further business, so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160927?start=2503)|
