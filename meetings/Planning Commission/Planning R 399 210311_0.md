| 0:24:48| Thank you. Before we get Commissioner Eddie Smith, I see your hands up. Did you have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1488)|
| 0:24:53| comment before we hear from the applicant and Mr. Kline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| I just wanted to apologize for being late. A meeting I had ran over and just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| let everybody, mostly the staff know that I was now in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| Thank you, sir. Mr. Forrester, would you like to go first? Would you like Mr. Kline to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| first? I'll go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| Name and address, please, and we have five minutes. Taylor Forrester, 1111 North North| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1512)|
| 0:25:21| Shore Drive, Suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919. Before we start, I turned my video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1521)|
| 0:25:29| on. I don't know if it worked or not. We can see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| Okay. We're requesting removal of the North Shore Town Center master plan, which in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1535)|
| 0:25:42| case is a special use request to remove what under recode now is determined to be a planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1542)|
| 0:25:48| development overlay. The proposed development or contemplated development for this piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1548)|
| 0:25:54| of property is for multifamily. The removal request is not solely based on wanting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| or is not based on wanting to develop multifamily apartments here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| Currently, as the property is situated under the master plan under the current zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1565)|
| 0:26:13| apartments can be developed. The problem is, is the way the master plan affects the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1573)|
| 0:26:20| with the core areas and the peripheral areas. If you lay the aerial of the original master| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| plan in 2004 over the North Shore Town Center, the roads do not line up, the tracks do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| line up and therefore we've created this bifurcated track resulting in two thirds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1591)|
| 0:26:37| approximately being in the core area and one third being in the peripheral area. The core| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1597)|
| 0:26:43| area and the peripheral area under the master plan have different requirements as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| the development and the design of what what can go on there and how it is to be situated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| on there. Master plan since it was originated in 2004 and accepted in 2005 has has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1613)|
| 0:27:03| pretty much abandoned throughout the whole entire North Shore Town Center development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| Between 2005 and 2009, there was hardly any development. I believe at the time of 2009| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1628)|
| 0:27:16| and 10 there were approximately about 20 houses, single family houses constructed at the rear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| of the development, the Beaumont area, and there was a mixed-use development developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| at the corner of Thunderhead Road and North Shore Drive. At that time, development had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| pretty much stalled. The current property owners purchased the note and acquired the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1652)|
| 0:27:39| track prior to it going to foreclosure. As we we learned obviously after years that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1659)|
| 0:27:45| town center concept was not appropriate for this area. In fact, town center developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1665)|
| 0:27:52| is proven are great designs on paper and appear wonderful and are great concepts, but in reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1672)|
| 0:27:59| the majority of them have not been successful over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1679)|
| 0:28:11| Around 2010 or 11, the first tracks to be abandoned under the or to abandon the master| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1691)|
| 0:28:19| plan and be rezoned was where the target and the publics were located. Again, nothing was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| being developed under the master plan based on the restrictions and in an effort to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1704)|
| 0:28:29| development going, a rezoning request and relief of the master plan was requested for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| approximately 35 acres along that eastern track. That was approved and the target and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| the publics were constructed. Again, at that time, under the town center zoning and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| master plan, such uses were not permitted. Thereafter, there was additional removal of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1723)|
| 0:28:52| additional tracks from the master plan and where it is now known as the Aventine Apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| there at North Shore and adjacent to Thunderhead Road. Following that, since there's been construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1737)|
| 0:29:05| of a regional medical facility, again, these were concepts that were not contemplated within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| the original master plan and as such, relief has been granted throughout the years to not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1750)|
| 0:29:17| require the master plan to be followed. This property is basically the remaining complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1757)|
| 0:29:23| track that is subject to this master plan overlay. This track, the owners have tried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1763)|
| 0:29:29| to get it developed, have tried to lure different types of uses there, whether it's restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1769)|
| 0:29:35| commercial, any things of those natures. However, there is just, there has not been the demand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1775)|
| 0:29:43| based on the restrictions and the problems associated encumbrances under the master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1783)|
| 0:29:49| It has prevented this site from being developed. In order to develop this under the master| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| plan, the core area would require an active use on the lower floors, meaning office, restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1794)|
| 0:30:03| These would be kind of smaller shops, multiple shops, and just there is no demand to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| that. There could be residential office above it and in the peripheral area that's on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1810)|
| 0:30:14| you could have some multi-family restaurants. Mr. Forrest, you've got 20 seconds left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| However, the problem is, is how do you accommodate the parking there? At that time, you didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| have to construct a structured parking garage on the site as well. Again, asking for relief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1823)|
| 0:30:30| from the master plan, asking for the equal treatment that every other parcel out here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| has been afforded over the years. And again, just following the trends of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| ask you to approve staff recommendation. Thank you, Mr. Forrester. Ms. Laments, I suppose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1840)|
| 0:30:48| you're in opposition to the request. You need to unmute, please, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| Yes. Okay. So, Mr. Kline and Ms. Laments, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1854)|
| 0:30:59| Mr. Kline, if you could kind of split your time up with Ms. Laments so both of you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1859)|
| 0:31:04| a chance to talk. Give me your name and address, please. And you have five minutes between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1864)|

| 0:31:22| Thank you. My address is 617 Main Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902. And I'm going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1882)|
| 0:31:30| to abbreviate my remarks so that we can fit all this in in five minutes. But I must say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| that Mr. Forrester did not give you an accurate recitation of the history because throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1895)|
| 0:31:42| the history, the residents of North Shore Town Center residential neighborhood and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1902)|
| 0:31:47| landowners up there have participated and worked cooperatively with the landowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1907)|
| 0:31:54| Mr. Forrester's client in first getting the big box draw into the North Shore Town Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1914)|
| 0:32:06| next the school, and after that, the apartments. And these were all done in cooperation so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1926)|
| 0:32:15| the area that we're talking about here today could continue to be part of the overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1935)|
| 0:32:23| which has been all along a mixed-use residential and restaurant office environment. What's being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1943)|
| 0:32:32| asked for today is post rezoning by the city, which allows a special use or an overlay such| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1952)|
| 0:32:44| as this to be removed. But this particular parcel has been promised by the landowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1964)|
| 0:32:54| which are Mr. Forrester's clients, as the remaining parcel that would fit the overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1974)|
| 0:33:02| and be part of it since the inception of their ownership. And my clients, the neighbors and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1982)|
| 0:33:11| the neighborhood and the landowners in the residential area purchased their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| at a very high price and built very high-priced homes under the impression and with the promise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=1997)|
| 0:33:25| that this town center overlay would remain and this area would remain. Once you remove the overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2005)|
| 0:33:35| under the new Municode for the City of Knoxville, there is no further public input. And commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2015)|
| 0:33:41| you don't have the ability under the new Municode to have conditional zoning anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2021)|
| 0:33:47| So to remove this overlay, this petition before you today, would completely eliminate my client's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2027)|
| 0:33:56| ability to have input. And so we ask that you please do not remove the overlay, and I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2036)|
| 0:34:03| defer now to Mary Lemenz. Yes, my name is Mary Lemenz. My address is 1650 Missick Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2043)|
| 0:34:12| Knoxville, Tennessee. I am a homeowner in North Shore Town Center. I'm speaking on behalf of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| neighbors in opposition to the removal of the overlay. The overlay is the only thing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2058)|
| 0:34:24| protects us and allows us to be participating, as we've said. Now, a few things I want you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2064)|
| 0:34:32| understand is that our community and each of us relied heavily on representations from the investor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| and representations from even city council in the rezone that that overlay would continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2078)|
| 0:34:44| protect us. Yes, a town center is a wonderful type of development, and we are close. But what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2084)|
| 0:34:52| proposing here is to allow an investor who invested nothing in infrastructure, nothing in sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2092)|
| 0:35:00| to piecemeal separate and pull out everything so nothing is left of a town center. And the reasoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2100)|
| 0:35:07| for approving this, your staff says, well, why not approve this, the apartments? Because that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2107)|
| 0:35:14| it looks like around it. But it only looks like the apartments because we consented to it. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2114)|
| 0:35:20| multi-use zoning that existed in the overlay called for 450 apartments. We have 300 apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2120)|
| 0:35:28| The school was never intended. We allowed the school because each step of the way this investor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| told us that there would be more development rushing in as soon as we allow these things to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2134)|
| 0:35:41| happen. But what you're proposing is to take away everything we relied on to make our homes and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2141)|
| 0:35:48| a choice to live in this type of community. And that is frankly unfair. What we are asking you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2148)|
| 0:35:53| do is to not approve the removal of the overlay and to not rezone. Now, I would love to invite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2153)|
| 0:36:01| you to our community and see what it is like, because it is a walkable community. It is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| community that has a real sense of community. It has those gathering spots proposed, a fire pit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| a park, many things. Please come and visit before you take away our protections. So now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2172)|
| 0:36:20| commission, we are relying on you to make the right decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| Thank you, Ms. Laments. Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2185)|
| 0:36:32| Thank you, Chair Phillips. I think we'd spoken about this once before. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2192)|
| 0:36:38| want to refresh and make sure that I understand this correctly. It was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| my recollection, it was the original intent during the new code that we removed these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2204)|
| 0:36:51| planning districts altogether, because we had carefully crafted a new code that we believed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2211)|
| 0:37:01| we were comfortable with. So that when we laid the new code over, we felt no need for these planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| districts. And then there was some voice of concern from a few of the folks out in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2228)|
| 0:37:19| And a couple of city council members. And if the order is correct, in my recollection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2239)|
| 0:37:27| they landed on somewhat of a compromise, where they wouldn't remove them, but they would give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2247)|
| 0:37:35| the developer a right to opt out subject to our approval. So I think what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2255)|
| 0:37:44| they have every right to come before us, because that's what we crafted as part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2264)|
| 0:37:51| You know, Ms. Laments, I have visited your community. You all have a beautiful community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| I love it. My daughter lives over in Aberdeen North. And I think everything done there has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2276)|
| 0:38:03| been done extremely well. However, I do believe that this will add some consistency by allowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2283)|
| 0:38:12| them to remove this. And I just don't know how it's going to be a detriment. We know what their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2292)|
| 0:38:21| plan is on this. And I just don't see the detriment to removing the overlay. And it's part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2301)|
| 0:38:28| right that they have in the process to ask for it. So I'm going to support the removal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| of this overlay. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2313)|
| 0:38:43| Um, yeah, Commissioner Hill said that we know what they want to do here. It's my understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2323)|
| 0:38:51| correct me if I'm wrong. They want to just build apartments. Is that is that correct? What exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| is the developer? What commitment is he making? What exactly does he want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2336)|
| 0:39:02| Commissioner, are you asking that to a specific I'm asking that to the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| What what exactly are they committing to do in terms of the mix of retail restaurants and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| apartments with this? Forrester? Yes, the entire site will will not be developed as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2353)|
| 0:39:20| as multifamily, there will be a reserve site estimate approximately an acre, maybe a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2360)|
| 0:39:27| more that will be dedicated for the hopes of a restaurant developed in a restaurant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| along the lake. That boardwalk would be extended all the way around and putting a piece of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2372)|
| 0:39:39| reserving and parcel I think more adjacent to that corner there of the of the downward seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2379)|
| 0:39:49| near the OR and L kind of along town center boulevard creating a restaurant there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2389)|
| 0:39:53| moving the restaurant up towards the the pond there with the outdoor seating along the boardwalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2393)|
| 0:40:00| and things of that nature. See, I'm getting the density to to really draw in attractive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2400)|
| 0:40:06| attractive users there. Yeah, I get it. And I'm a real estate guy. And so I understand that. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2406)|
| 0:40:13| I'm really concerned. I think that in this, you know, this property was given a town center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| designation, which allowed the property owners and developers to do things like bring in a target and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2418)|
| 0:40:25| bring in the public's and you know, the two out parcels that they sold a million dollars an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2425)|
| 0:40:30| to First Tennessee Bank and Chick-fil-A. And now you have stakeholders that have invested and moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| there. I eat lunch at Cassie's at least once a week. And I think people would like to and expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2435)|
| 0:40:42| and believe they were buying into that kind of development all the way around the pond. And so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2442)|
| 0:40:48| my problem is, I think we need to have some way to look at whatever they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2448)|
| 0:40:54| I mean, they're to the very end of this. And, you know, I think we miss an opportunity to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2454)|
| 0:41:00| something super special that these people were promised when this development went in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2460)|
| 0:41:05| but by doing away with this review, and allowing all apartments with one acre of retail, I just I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2465)|
| 0:41:12| not going to support removal of the of the planned district until we have something more palatable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2472)|
| 0:41:19| for the neighbors that they can look at ahead of time and say, Okay, yeah, this is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2479)|
| 0:41:26| Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2486)|
| 0:41:31| I echo Commissioner Scott Smith. We know that the requested zone CG3 has quite a few design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2491)|
| 0:41:43| standards that would make the apartments appear more compatible with the town center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2503)|
| 0:41:50| But I think there are two elements which are missing. One is the requirement for a mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2510)|
| 0:41:59| more than just the one acre restaurant. CG3 is called a mixed use zone that doesn't require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2519)|
| 0:42:07| mixed use. That's one. And two is the inability for the current residents to be involved in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2527)|
| 0:42:17| design. As much as the developer has quite a bit at stake, so do each of those homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2537)|
| 0:42:25| regarding their own home and property. So I will echo Commissioner Smith and I would like to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2545)|
| 0:42:34| more certainty before I would approve this. Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| Egan. Thanks, Chair. Mr. Forster, you had mentioned earlier that along the time of this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2560)|
| 0:42:54| that the developer and other developers had gone to those residents and worked with them to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2574)|
| 0:43:00| the school and the apartments and done some things to help keep the viability of this town center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2580)|
| 0:43:09| that was really defunct for a long time to keep it moving. And obviously there's more energy out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| there today than there has been in the past. And I think Mr. Hill brought up some good comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| about the intent of this overlay, but I do wonder if they have been such good partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2601)|
| 0:43:31| as a community to help the developer figure out ways to continue to get this developed and move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2611)|
| 0:43:38| down the path of a successful development. Have you guys sat down with the community and shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2618)|
| 0:43:46| them what you're wanting to do? And are you guys just at an impasse because of the use or is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| they just don't want any more apartments, but they've seen the plan? I mean, where's the rub?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2631)|
| 0:43:57| I understand about the losing the control aspect of it, but have you guys met and what's your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2637)|
| 0:44:06| opinion of the separation? I would say in my opinion, it's more at this time a use dispute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2646)|
| 0:44:15| and I may be wrong there, but I mean, that's mine in conversations with Mr. Klein. I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2655)|
| 0:44:23| the conversations with him dealt with removing the overlay, but again, the development or the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2663)|
| 0:44:28| contemplated development cannot be accomplished with the existing overlay. And this is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2668)|
| 0:44:34| here's the problem that I've seen, and this is probably the third development I've worked on in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| the city where the applicant developer is being now penalized under RECODE. It's not that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2680)|
| 0:44:50| trying to avoid any kind of coming back for special use review or use on review. RECODE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| was approved and kind of did away with that, which it did create heightened standards, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2696)|
| 0:45:01| seemed great for everybody. And the fact of it removing any kind of use on review or special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2701)|
| 0:45:07| review process has penalized my clients on about three different occasions now. Like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2707)|
| 0:45:17| I have no problem in working with residents and going through that process and had no problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| with the use on review process, but again, that's not afforded and RECODE has almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2723)|
| 0:45:31| been used as a double-edged sword against some of these developments. And again, as Mr. Klein said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2731)|
| 0:45:37| I would have no problem with operating under some conditional zones and agreements or conditional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2737)|
| 0:45:43| zoning requirements and things of that nature, but again, that's been removed. So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2743)|
| 0:45:50| previous one I had before in this body in order to approve it, it was a multi-family and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| the client and I guess echoing addressing some of Mr. Smith's comments was client there spent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2755)|
| 0:46:01| probably $50,000 to $70,000 on rendering, engineering, traffic studies, the works. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2761)|
| 0:46:07| just went on and on. But again, the comment was, well, there's no additional review of this. How| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2767)|
| 0:46:11| can we guarantee that? So, even putting forth detailed plans and spending, you know, upwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2771)|
| 0:46:17| close to $100,000. Mr. Forrester, I'm going to have to chime in here. We've got other comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2777)|
| 0:46:23| from the commission, and so I need to move on with them. So, Chair will recognize Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| Buston. Thank you, Chair Phillips. Mr. Forrester, can I just have a real quick question follow-up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2789)|
| 0:46:40| from Commissioner Uten, and then I'd like to make a quick summary. Did you meet with the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2800)|
| 0:46:48| I know you talked, kind of talked around that. Did you guys actually meet with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2808)|
| 0:46:53| or did you just meet with Mr. Kline? No, we held a Zoom meeting at the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2813)|
| 0:47:00| before the initial December meeting, and there have been some questions kind of back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| that try to get some answers to. And to me, it seemed kind of where we were was a used dispute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2824)|
| 0:47:12| but there, I'm sure the community wanted detailed plans and to really see what was going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2832)|
| 0:47:18| how it was going to look, to all the extent, and that was the impasse I was kind of talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| All right, thank you. One thing I would just like to add is when we were working on recode, I heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2844)|
| 0:47:35| at the time, Gerald Green say many times that we're going to be learning through this. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2855)|
| 0:47:40| going to be, we may make it, we're going to have, there are going to be instances that we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2860)|
| 0:47:45| to make this recode better. I'm, you know, I'm in favor with several other commissioners that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2865)|
| 0:47:56| we need to look at each thing through a lens of common sense, and we know recode is a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2876)|
| 0:48:03| document, but we approved something last month that we went against recode. And the thing I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2883)|
| 0:48:11| here is these people, they bought into a particular plan, and if we move the overlay, we are subjecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2891)|
| 0:48:26| them to who knows what. And I'm sure Mr. Forrester and their group would do a great job. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2906)|
| 0:48:36| I just cannot support this either. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Boston. Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2916)|
| 0:48:48| Thank you, Commissioner Phillips. I would like to reiterate my concern about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| removal of the overlay, and I'm particularly compelled by the fact that the community has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2933)|
| 0:49:00| worked with developers in the past to the extent of allowing them to work around a master plan that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2940)|
| 0:49:06| they had all invested in, and that being hinged upon this area being retained for that core| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2946)|
| 0:49:17| town center concept, that walkability, having this seems to be the thing that they were holding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| on to. They were willing to make these other adjustments if this could be retained. And now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2962)|
| 0:49:28| for that good faith, they're being asked to abandon that idea. Mr. Forrester said that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2968)|
| 0:49:35| master plan had been, quote, abandoned. And I don't think that that is the case. It sounds like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2975)|
| 0:49:42| the master plan has been modified, as all plans end up being, but that this particular request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2982)|
| 0:49:49| is asking to abandon the master plan, and I cannot support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2989)|
| 0:49:56| Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=2996)|
| 0:50:00| Thank you, Chair Phillips. I actually think that staff has gotten this one right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3000)|
| 0:50:15| You know, I'll reiterate some of Commissioner Hill's comments about the overall development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| I mean, it is a beautiful development. I mean, the school, the houses, the departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3021)|
| 0:50:26| the target, the public, I mean, publics, I mean, everything is fabulous in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3026)|
| 0:50:31| The fact of the matter, though, is that building where Cassie's is, and some of the other retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3031)|
| 0:50:39| if I'm not mistaken, it was bought, you know, kind of that foreclosure with the rest of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| property. So it's kind of telling as to what it takes, you know, to make retail work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3044)|
| 0:50:51| You know, I don't think the target and the public's performs that well, either. So it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| and this property has been sitting there for quite a while. I mean, it's not like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| you know, the developers haven't tried. And probably what would be a fabulous catalyst for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3060)|
| 0:51:08| you know, this development is more residential. You know, you get more apartments in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3068)|
| 0:51:12| nice upscale apartments, you know, and then there's more commercial and retail and restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| and the things that you want to see, you know, that are going to develop, you know, in that town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3077)|
| 0:51:23| center. So I certainly do have feelings on both sides. And I can understand the homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3083)|
| 0:51:31| hesitations for sure. But in my opinion, this, this, this is the right thing for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| development right now. So I would support this. Thank you, Commissioner Browning. Chair recognizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3096)|
| 0:51:42| Commissioner Roth. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Kind of I was going to, I'm going to echo the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3102)|
| 0:51:51| message pretty much what I was going to summarize and say there is it doesn't sound to me like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3111)|
| 0:51:59| the existing overlay matches what's going to be successful there. And I think they're all looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3119)|
| 0:52:08| for something that will be successful. You know, thinking back to when we approved this town center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| back in the day, for longer than I care to think about. One of the big things about making that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3134)|
| 0:52:22| successful is for people to be there. And I think we talked about that when we reviewed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| apartments that went in there before, is that in order for them to be successful in town center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| environment, you have to have people that live there and go there. And I think although I go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3152)|
| 0:52:39| down there quite often as well, eat dinner and lunch and stuff like that. But I think for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3159)|
| 0:52:45| most part, people that live there have to support that community. And I was thinking, I think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3165)|
| 0:52:52| proposal is fine. I think staff got this right as well. Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3172)|
| 0:52:59| Commissioner Scott Smith. Yeah, I just want to respond a little bit to what Lou was saying. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| mean, there's no failure down there. This place is thriving. I mean, the biggest problem you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3185)|
| 0:53:14| got when you go to the restaurants down there is seeing if you can get in without having to wait| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| too long. You know, Mike Chase is doing a new restaurant right on the other side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3198)|
| 0:53:24| Pellissippi. And I'm telling you, the problem here is for the last 12 months since COVID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3204)|
| 0:53:30| retail has been slow. Okay, so yeah, you may have to wait another six or eight months for things to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| get going again, where people are buying restaurant sites. But you know, this is a prime spot. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3215)|
| 0:53:42| think I think the developers if they cut and run on just selling this off for apartments are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3222)|
| 0:53:48| to kick themselves a year or so down the road when retail comes back. This is a really neat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3228)|
| 0:53:55| development, a really neat piece of property and opportunity. So I would encourage everybody to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3235)|
| 0:54:00| really, you know, let's hold off and let this thing be what it is. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3240)|
| 0:54:11| Commissioners, we keep raising hands and we'll be here all night long. But I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| give a little more flexibility. Commissioner Boston, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3255)|
| 0:54:20| Chair Phillips, I'd like to make a motion to deny the request to remove the previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| approved plan district designation from this parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3265)|
| 0:54:32| Miss Adams, are you second to that motion? I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| Before we go to a vote, we still have two hands up. Commissioner Cormillick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| Thank you, Chair Phillips. I have a quick question for staff. I believe that they can still come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3283)|
| 0:54:51| to have a mix of apartments with non-residential below if the overlay remains in place. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3291)|
| 0:55:00| correct? We're not precluding them from applying in keeping the overlay. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3300)|
| 0:55:11| Yes. If whoever is running the slides can go to page 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| The orange area that you see would be allowed to have the restaurants and things like that on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3314)|
| 0:55:21| ground level. And the white area would not. So as long as they developed in that orange area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3321)|
| 0:55:27| the restaurants would be able to go in there. But not in this corridor here along Thunderhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3327)|
| 0:55:37| Thank you, Miss Porce. Any other questions before we go to a vote on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| So we have a motion by Commissioner Buston, second by Commissioner Adams to deny the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| to remove the previously approved plan district designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| from this parcel subject to the two conditions. Call the roll, please, Miss Edmonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3353)|

| 0:57:06| Thank you. We'll move on to item number 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3426)|
| 0:57:13| Applicant is Taylor Forrester on behalf of North Shore Mark Investor LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3433)|

| 0:57:35| and see previously approved plan district designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3455)|
| 0:57:39| It's only requested CG3 General Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| Staff recommendation approved CG3 General Commercial Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| because it would allow the development more consistent with the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| Thank you. Mr. Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3474)|
| 0:57:59| Yes. Are you available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| Would you like to go first? Would you like opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| I can go first. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| You have, again, your name and address, and you have five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| and then we'll turn it over to Mr. Klein for comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3489)|
| 0:58:17| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North Shore Drive, suite S700, Knoxville, Tennessee, 3791.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3497)|
| 0:58:25| I'm asking that you follow staff recommendation and rezone the property from CR2 to CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3505)|
| 0:58:33| As stated throughout staff report, it's important to note that the CG3 is more similar and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3513)|
| 0:58:41| compatible with the existing and surrounding developments within the town center zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3521)|
| 0:58:48| or the town center development district there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3528)|
| 0:58:51| The setbacks, the lot dimensions are much more similar under the CG3 zone versus the CR2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3531)|
| 0:59:07| as well as it's important to note that the uses in the commercial region of the CR2 zone would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3547)|
| 0:59:14| there are several uses in there that are permitted either by right or by special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| that allow for more intensive type uses than were originally contemplated within the original town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3558)|
| 0:59:25| center zoning. And part of the reason for the request of the CG3 zone was that it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3565)|
| 0:59:32| as it correlated to the removal request of the town center overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3572)|
| 0:59:38| these were discussions we had with planning staff prior to ever filing or submitting this, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3578)|
| 0:59:46| by removing the overlay that it would make sense to request a rezoning to the CG3 to ensure kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3586)|
| 0:59:53| the lot dimensions, the setbacks, how the parking was aligned on the property would more align with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3593)|
| 0:59:59| the surrounding development being the town center zoning. Commercial regional zoning is, or CR2 is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3599)|
| 1:00:08| contemplated to be medium to heavy intensity of development, high density residential. Again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3608)|
| 1:00:16| we believe more of a CG3 medium density residential approach is the most appropriate for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3616)|
| 1:00:23| property. All in all, the CG3 zone is in fact a down zoning from the CR2. Again, apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3623)|
| 1:00:35| multifamily can be developed in either zone, whether CR2 or CG3 multifamily components would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3635)|
| 1:00:45| be the same and the dimensions and the setbacks, height restrictions would all be very similar as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| well. Again, it deals more with the down zoning effect and the limiting effect of what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3651)|
| 1:00:59| affordable or allowed under the CG3 zone versus the CG2 or CR2 zone. Again, asking that you follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3659)|
| 1:01:07| staff recommendation, believe this is an appropriate down zoning and would be compatible and consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3667)|
| 1:01:13| with the surrounding area. I'll reserve my time for rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| Thank you. Chair recognizes Wayne Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| Unmute, Wayne. Is that better? There you go. Thank you. I'm sorry. Wayne Kline, 617 Main Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3681)|
| 1:01:33| Hodges, Dowdy and Carson, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902. This zoning, as Mr. Forrester states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3693)|
| 1:01:40| this request was conditioned upon removal of the overlay and now that it's not removed by your vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3700)|
| 1:01:48| and the last item, I think it's better to keep it as it is and allow the parties to work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3708)|
| 1:01:56| in the zone that it was zoned by the city in the recode so that we can work together and try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3716)|
| 1:02:02| work something up that meets the overlay and also meets the conditions requested by the petitioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3722)|
| 1:02:12| I don't know why Mr. Forrester wants to move ahead now that the overlay has not been removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3732)|
| 1:02:19| I will say no more. Thank you, Mr. Kline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| Ms. Porce, in light of the action by the Planning Commission on item number 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3745)|
| 1:02:32| could you address the request on the CG3?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3752)|
| 1:02:40| Sure. So the CG3 zone is technically a down zoning from the CR2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3760)|
| 1:02:49| CG2 does not allow, it allows vehicular uses, vehicle sales and stuff like that as a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| use versus the CR districts that allow them by right. The uses in this case are mostly guided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3775)|
| 1:03:02| by the master plan, but the CR zone does allow those uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3782)|
| 1:03:14| Any other comments? Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3794)|
| 1:03:20| Yeah, I just wanted to say that my big issue was this thing. I support everybody. I support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| development of this property. I just want to make sure that we get a chance to look at what's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3805)|
| 1:03:30| to go in there. And if this gives them more of a more broad ability to create something nice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3810)|
| 1:03:38| I'm not really opposed to the rezoning. I was going to ask Mr. Kline if he could explain what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3818)|
| 1:03:44| like if this, if we're able, if we give them this rezoning, if they get, if they are successful in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3824)|
| 1:03:49| that, what's the worst thing that could happen? I mean, what is your concern about giving them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3829)|
| 1:03:56| this zoning if we get to review the plan? Commissioner Smith, the main problem associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3836)|
| 1:04:04| with it is the transportation corridor through the process and the CR2 working with the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3844)|
| 1:04:13| And so beyond that, I don't see a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| That's all. Thank you. Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3857)|
| 1:04:28| Thank you, Chair Phillips. This may be the only time that we'll see in a long time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3868)|
| 1:04:35| someone opposing a more restrictive zoning. I mean, this CG3 is, when you read the intent of CG3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3875)|
| 1:04:46| it's really about these village settings where people live. So when you look at CR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3886)|
| 1:04:55| had this been the opposite in any other place, I think the public would be outraged for a CR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3895)|
| 1:05:02| versus if it had been zoned CG3. I don't see any good reason not to rezone at CG3. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3902)|
| 1:05:12| Thank you. Hearing no other, seeing no other comments, is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=3912)|

| 1:11:50| that you want to build as much as you can because it's all based on profit. You do what you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4310)|
| 1:11:57| do. You build it, you sell it, and then you're out of here. As a member of the community, I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4317)|

| 1:12:22| that you change the zoning to RM-3 and leave hillside protection in place. It's more consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4342)|
| 1:12:29| with my community. It comes down to two things, safety versus profit. Thank you so much for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4349)|

| 1:12:43| Yes, Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500. To reiterate, we were here discussing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4363)|

| 1:13:13| front acreage of the parcel, but to preserve as much of the hillside protection of the ridgetops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4393)|
| 1:13:21| those areas to the south of the property. We postponed it, consented to a postponement to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4401)|
| 1:13:29| be able to do that, went back, and we were able to come up with a line that captured as much of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4409)|
| 1:13:35| the non-hillside areas and the slopes below 15% as possible, leaving the balance to not be subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4415)|
| 1:13:42| to our rezoning application. That yielded a total of 21.98 acres, and once the slope analysis under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4422)|

| 1:14:02| develop to begin with. So I think that was a win-win for everyone. Our development, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4442)|
| 1:14:10| proposed development, is not really going to affect the hillside protection. Look, there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| some hashed areas there, but those are the hashed areas that are, you know, still in the moderate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4455)|
| 1:14:21| slope that does allow there to be disturbance, so that gives us the most flexibility for the type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| development we are proposing. The reason we're asking for RN5 and the primary difference between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4466)|
| 1:14:32| RN5 and RN3 is RN3 does not allow for consideration of multifamily, whereas RN5 would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4472)|
| 1:14:41| There is RN5 immediately to the east of this property, and there are other areas of RN5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4481)|
| 1:14:49| in the immediate vicinity. Staff has recommended a sector plan amendment to MDR. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4489)|
| 1:14:58| you know, if we had come forward with this application in January of 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4498)|
| 1:15:03| staff's recommendation of MDR would suit the RN5 designation. However, City Council then decided to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4503)|
| 1:15:10| remove RN5 from consideration for the MDR sector plan, which is why we're asking for the MDRO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4510)|
| 1:15:17| There's not a lot of differences between the two, although MDRO does allow for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| consideration for office and for the RN5 zoning. You know, regarding the potential impacts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4521)|
| 1:15:30| there is an opportunity to make road improvements along merchants along the frontage. The front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4530)|
| 1:15:35| seven acres of one of these parcels, the largest parcel, is already zoned Neighborhood Commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| Under the new zoning ordinance, Neighborhood Commercial does allow multifamily apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4540)|
| 1:15:45| as a matter of right. It's a permitted use where there would not be a subsequent special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4545)|
| 1:15:50| application to go forward. We've looked at that. We do not want to constrain our development on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4550)|
| 1:15:56| those seven acres, but we know what we can do with that if that is one of the options that we're left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4556)|
| 1:16:02| with. Regarding the consideration for development of RN3, that does allow single-family homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4562)|
| 1:16:10| duplexes, and townhomes. And in my most recent correspondence, I gave you a permitted density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4570)|
| 1:16:18| by zone chart that I was provided by planning staff, which looks at the maximum density you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| can get for different housing units in different zones. Now, that is a best-case scenario for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4584)|
| 1:16:32| perfect piece of property not applying hillside protections. So, it doesn't say that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4592)|
| 1:16:39| get a certain maximum amount per acre, but in a perfect world for a perfect piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4599)|
| 1:16:45| these numbers would apply based upon the dimensional design standards in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| So, it at least allows us to conceptualize what type of impact we may have in developing residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4610)|
| 1:16:55| properties under different zones. And I would submit that the RN3 with the potential allowance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4615)|
| 1:17:02| of 170 single-family homes, and these numbers are in my letter, 226 duplexes and 263 townhomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4622)|
| 1:17:10| would have an equal or, if not greater impact on schools and potential traffic issues. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4630)|
| 1:17:17| traffic problems are there. This is an opportunity where through this development, this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| has been underutilized and underdeveloped for quite some time, where we can address some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| those. We'll do whatever engineering requires regarding improving access, improving sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4646)|
| 1:17:33| as part of our development, but it is our intent and what we had looked at and what these developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4653)|
| 1:17:38| when they looked at this property and purchased it, intend to develop approximately 250 multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4658)|
| 1:17:46| units, and that fits within their concept. They know what they can do with that, and we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4666)|
| 1:17:51| ask that you would approve the RN5 zoning and the MDR sector plan amendment. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4671)|
| 1:17:56| Thank you, Mr. Mullins. Just to reiterate, the request is for a medium-density residential office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4676)|
| 1:18:04| and the sector plan staff's recommendation is medium-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4684)|
| 1:18:08| along the hillside protection. Chair will recognize Commissioner Odenstein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4688)|
| 1:18:15| Yeah, Chair. I just wanted to commend the applicant for taking the time to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4695)|
| 1:18:22| and look at this for us. I, you know, Commissioner, I, you know, Beth always,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4702)|
| 1:18:31| Beth always brings up, you know, how important that, you know, these hillside and slope protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| parts of our city are, and, you know, sometimes we move things around and do things and work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4716)|
| 1:18:42| around it. Here, to be able to almost preserve that many acres in kind of the core part of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4722)|
| 1:18:51| I think that's a wonderful gift that we're going to get given on this particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| Giving up the see-in zone when you can go ahead and already do apartments and try to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4738)|
| 1:19:03| instead of trying to squeeze them up on the road, you know, allow those to be a better development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4743)|
| 1:19:09| inside what they're asking for, I think is a, I think will end up with an overall better development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4749)|
| 1:19:15| You know, the piece of property is on a bus line. You know, the city needs this type of housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4755)|
| 1:19:23| close to the city on bus lines. You know, the fact that there's needed to be some road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4763)|
| 1:19:29| improvements along Merchants and now the city has an opportunity, I don't know how many front feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| of road we're talking about here, but to be able to work with a developer at a main intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4773)|
| 1:19:43| of Wilkerson Road, to be able to work with that developer on that much road frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| at one time contiguous, you know, that's tough to do in itself. So, I think there's way more benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4788)|
| 1:19:57| to what this applicant has brought to us than what we've had to deal with in the past. I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4797)|
| 1:20:04| certainly support this. Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4804)|
| 1:20:13| I, too, appreciate the applicant taking the time to draw the line, as Commissioner Uden had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4813)|
| 1:20:19| suggested last month. I did want to state that that request to draw the line was not a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4819)|
| 1:20:26| to RN-5, but a hope that the land could be used in a manner that was its best stewardship. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4826)|
| 1:20:35| really appreciate the effort to do that. At our agenda review meeting, staff presented a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4835)|
| 1:20:42| compelling report regarding this case about this missing middle housing. And that wasn't apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4842)|
| 1:20:50| but it was this duplex and townhome component that, if I understand correctly, is what RN-3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4850)|
| 1:20:57| would allow. So, I think for those reasons, I will be supporting the staff recommendation for RN-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4857)|
| 1:21:10| Thank you. Commissioner Dent. Yes, I have a question, I believe, for transportation or staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4870)|
| 1:21:19| I know that around school zones, there is an area where you have to slow down and drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4879)|
| 1:21:25| slower during school, beginning and end. How long of a length is that against the road? And I ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4885)|
| 1:21:32| just because, since this is in the parental school zone, I know that we've discussed that a crosswalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4892)|
| 1:21:38| and sidewalks will be considered and added. My biggest concern is that that corner coming around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4898)|
| 1:21:47| I can't quite see what road that is, but coming around that corner right before the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| starts, people tend to go fast. Whether the kind of school zone where you slow down would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4910)|
| 1:21:57| extend, you know, from Norwood all the way down to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4917)|
| 1:22:03| Ms. Dent, who are you requesting? The staff or transportation would answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4923)|
| 1:22:12| This is Curtis Williams with City Engineering. I'm not exactly sure where the school zone starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4932)|
| 1:22:18| It should be marked along the roadway out there. And typically, that's something that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4938)|
| 1:22:25| evaluated by our Traffic Engineering Division. Most likely, this development would not require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4945)|
| 1:22:33| that sign location be moved unless it, for some reason, conflicted with, say, like the access of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4953)|
| 1:22:39| this development or something of that nature. But otherwise, it probably won't impact the location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4959)|
| 1:22:45| of that signage. Thank you. Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4965)|
| 1:22:58| Yeah, I just wanted to kind of make a point in thinking about what Commissioner Uden said and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4978)|
| 1:23:06| Adams. You know, there's RN-5 next door to this. I'm afraid that if we don't get to the RN-5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4986)|
| 1:23:13| I mean, the applicant is setting aside a lot of conservation land here. The duplexes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4993)|
| 1:23:19| townhomes just simply take up more space because they're not vertical and they're not attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=4999)|
| 1:23:25| And so I think that the trade-off there is, you know, to get property conserved and save the trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5005)|
| 1:23:33| and have an area like that that's left undisturbed. I think it makes sense to go with RN-5. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5013)|
| 1:23:37| think it's a case that's easy to make because it's just an extension of the RN-5 that's next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5017)|
| 1:23:44| door. So I would be supportive of that. And my question would be, did I understand correctly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5024)|
| 1:23:50| that RN-5 cannot go in an MDR? It has to be an MDO? Sector plan change, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5030)|
| 1:23:58| This is Liz. Yes, that is correct. RN-5 has to have an MDRO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5038)|
| 1:24:05| sector plan and one-year plan designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5045)|
| 1:24:12| Thank you, Liz. Chair recognizes Commissioner Jeff Croft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5052)|
| 1:24:18| Thank you, Matt. I'd like to make a motion that we approve MDRO slash hillside protection as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5058)|
| 1:24:27| mentioned. We have a motion and a second before we go to vote. Chair recognizes Commissioner Eason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5067)|
| 1:24:39| I do appreciate that the applicant has come back to us with a line as was discussed at the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5079)|
| 1:24:48| meeting. And I think in this case, I understand the need for the missing middle housing in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5088)|
| 1:24:54| community. But I think in this particular property, this particular instance, and with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| RN-5 right next door, that I think that RN-5 is appropriate. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5098)|
| 1:25:04| Thank you. So we have a motion by Commissioner Scott Smith, seconded by Commissioner Browning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5104)|
| 1:25:10| to approve MDRO and HP hillside protection land use designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5110)|
| 1:25:19| That was Eddie. I didn't make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| I'm sorry, is Jeff Roth and Blue Browning? Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5123)|
| 1:25:30| All right. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5130)|
| 1:25:31| All right. Thank you. Ms. Edmonds, would you call the roll, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| Commissioner Eaton? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5135)|
| 1:25:38| Commissioner Eddie Smith? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| Commissioner Eason? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5141)|
| 1:25:44| Commissioner Buston? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| Commissioner Dent? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| Commissioner Roth? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5150)|
| 1:25:53| Commissioner Adams? I'm sorry, I need to confirm that this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| the motion is not taking the MDR that staff recommended, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5158)|
| 1:26:05| That's correct. The motion is MDRO and hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5165)|
| 1:26:11| Thank you for confirming that. No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| Commissioner Browning? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| Commissioner Phillips? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| Commissioner Graf? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5181)|
| 1:26:24| Commissioner Korbelik?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5184)|
| 1:26:32| Commissioner Korbelik? I'm trying. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5192)|
| 1:26:39| Commissioner Scott Smith? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5199)|
| 1:26:42| Commissioner Boyer? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| Commissioner Hill? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| Motion carries 13 to 1. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5206)|
| 1:26:50| The second motion is recommendation by staff on the one-year plan amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5210)|
| 1:26:56| approve medium-density residential and hillside protection land use designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5216)|

| 1:27:07| I'd like to make that motion, Pat. Well, hang on before we do that. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5227)|
| 1:27:16| does it need to be medium-density residential office, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| Yeah, I guess I'm a little bit confused why we're voting twice for medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5241)|
| 1:27:31| What is the sector plan? What is the one-year plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| Okay, I got you. I'd like to make a motion to approve MDRO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5255)|

| 1:29:01| requested RN5. And I'd like to make a motion we approve RN5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| And hillside protection? Seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5347)|
| 1:29:09| With hillside protection. Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5349)|
| 1:29:12| Seconded. Motion by Commissioner Ross,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5352)|

| 1:30:18| Next item is agenda item number 14. Yeah, this is a rezoning. The applicant is Eric Garcia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5418)|
| 1:30:26| Salas, location west side of North Broadway across from Sanders Drive, north of Adair Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5426)|
| 1:30:34| size of tract 0.3 acres. Present zoning is CG2, general commercial. Zoning requested CG1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5434)|
| 1:30:43| general commercial. Staff recommendation, deny CG1, general commercial because it does not meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5443)|
| 1:30:52| all the criteria for rezoning. Is the applicant present, Mr. Salas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5452)|
| 1:30:59| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5459)|
| 1:31:04| Any opposition on this item? I'm not aware of any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| There's no opposition. Chair Phillips, I'm going to take lead in presenting for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5468)|
| 1:31:16| Your name and address, and you have about five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| Yes, Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, suite 500. This is a similar rezoning request than what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5478)|
| 1:31:27| was before you on Kingston Pike at the February agenda. There was quite a bit of conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5487)|
| 1:31:35| about the differences between certain types of uses that are allowed in the general commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5495)|
| 1:31:41| zone and the different levels of general commercial zone being CG3, 2, and 1, and how CG1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5501)|
| 1:31:48| because of the not having the requirement to be between 0 and 20 feet from the front lot line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5508)|
| 1:31:56| gives more flexibility towards certain businesses that are automobile related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5516)|
| 1:32:03| We had a great, robust conversation about that. That zoning was narrowly denied by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5523)|
| 1:32:13| We had another great conversation with city council, and they approved that rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| And this is very similar. This zone is CG2 at North Broadway, 4821 North Broadway, just north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5537)|
| 1:32:27| of the 640 interchange, where North Broadway is still a five-lane highway, two lanes going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5547)|
| 1:32:35| north and south with a center turn lane. The proposed use for this is the same use that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5555)|
| 1:32:41| proposed, one of the uses that was proposed on the other lot, a take five service shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5561)|
| 1:32:47| And that shop is the model for that business is that the customer stays in their vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5567)|
| 1:32:56| while they're getting their oil changed or their fluids changed or the windshield wipers changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| and so they pull in and then they pull out. And because of that, the access needs to be further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5580)|
| 1:33:07| back than 20 feet from the highway. When we were talking about earlier rezoning application this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5587)|
| 1:33:15| morning with the, or this afternoon with the town center, one of the justifications from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5595)|
| 1:33:22| changing that zone, down zoning that property from CR2 to CG3 in that case, were that the uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5602)|
| 1:33:28| and the setbacks for the general commercial zone were more in line with what was already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| And that's exactly the case we have here. If you look at the uses, there's a Firestone service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| station across the street. There's two gas stations at the intersections. There are multiple drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5619)|
| 1:33:45| through restaurants in that area. And so this area is not, as Mr. Commissioner Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5625)|
| 1:33:51| talked about, a village type setting. It is an area where people were coming off the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5631)|
| 1:33:57| and going to their neighborhoods. Maybe the adjacent neighborhoods east of there to Adair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| Gardens, but it's still at this location. It is a general commercial area with several vehicle-centric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5642)|
| 1:34:11| uses. And that's what we're asking for here. I understand the new zoning ordinance is new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5651)|
| 1:34:19| I think the zoning ordinance has been wonderful. It has done a lot of things that have been better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5659)|
| 1:34:27| for the community and for the developers. But at the same time, and where to apply these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5667)|
| 1:34:32| different commercial zones, that was a conversation in certain areas. And I would like to akin this to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5672)|
| 1:34:39| building a new home. You can build a beautiful home, but sometimes you have a punch list of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5679)|
| 1:34:43| little things that you need to work out. And I think applying CG1 at this location is one of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5683)|
| 1:34:51| those items. So I would respectfully request that we not follow staff's recommendation in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5691)|
| 1:35:00| and that we approve the rezoning from CG2 to CG1 in this location. And I know Mr. Salas is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5700)|
| 1:35:06| I think there's a representative of the owner group, Mr. Osborne. He may be online, as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5706)|
| 1:35:12| as Michael Alterman, who can answer any questions about our concept for this property and why we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5712)|
| 1:35:18| need the CG1 zone. Thank you. Mr. Salas, Mr. Osborne, would you like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5718)|
| 1:35:27| I'll go real quick. My name is John Osborne. I'm at 132 Sherlake Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5727)|
| 1:35:32| 37922. And I'm just here as a member representative of the ownership group. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5732)|
| 1:35:38| fully support these guys. I guess you could also say I'm also here as a representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5738)|
| 1:35:43| as a neighbor. We developed the parcel north. It was before recode. It obviously would not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5743)|
| 1:35:49| congruent with the CG1 standards now. And the only thing I would say is that, you know, we stand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5749)|
| 1:35:56| behind these guys, and I would defer to them. But if there's any questions, I'm here to not only show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5756)|
| 1:36:01| support, but answer any questions. Thank you, Mr. Osborne. Mr. Salas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5761)|
| 1:36:06| would you like to make a comment? Sorry about that. I was on mute. I just wanted to reiterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5766)|
| 1:36:16| Eric Garcia Salas. We're at 755 Commerce Drive in Atlanta, Georgia. I think I'd just follow with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5776)|
| 1:36:23| what Ben said and John. I mean, I think it would be a little bit tough for the current zoning to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5783)|
| 1:36:29| have the cars drive through it, as it's a little bit difficult to make that turn there at the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5789)|
| 1:36:35| if we are too close to the roadway. And I think it'd be a little bit better with the CG1 requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5795)|
| 1:36:46| for us. Thank you. Chair recognizes Commissioner Kowalik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5806)|
| 1:36:58| Yes, thank you. I first wanted to observe that Mr. Mullen submitted a very well-written letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5818)|
| 1:37:06| but I do disagree with many of the premises that he states in that letter. For example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5826)|
| 1:37:16| what he said just now is that this is similar to the master plan discussion we had previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5836)|
| 1:37:22| And I would point out that what we're trying to do here is to actually get a coherent design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5842)|
| 1:37:29| thing that is more aesthetically pleasing. This is not complying with the master plan. The problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5849)|
| 1:37:35| is that there is no master plan. He states in his letter that one of the reasons we should grant the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5855)|
| 1:37:42| CG1 has to do with the specific branding and marketing of the applicant. It's not the job of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5862)|
| 1:37:51| the Planning Commission to alter our rules and regulations so that their logo can continue to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5871)|
| 1:37:57| used. We need to look at the decision criteria that are before us, and he has not demonstrated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5877)|
| 1:38:04| how that decision criteria is met. I further would propose that this is a basically wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5884)|
| 1:38:12| site. He's picked a site that is too rectangular and too narrow, and that the use itself doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5892)|
| 1:38:21| fit well on the property. If we are going to look at the previous application that was considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5901)|
| 1:38:28| to be similar, they are having that same problem, and with their site plan, they're having some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5908)|
| 1:38:34| strong issues with their transportation, with their traffic flow. I do ask the applicant two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5914)|
| 1:38:42| questions. One is, how do you propose to build the building to stay out of the flood area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5922)|
| 1:38:50| Another distinguishing difference from the previous application. And then after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5930)|
| 1:38:56| I want you to describe footnote three in your letter, exactly what you mean by that. But the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5936)|
| 1:39:02| first question is, how would the building be designed so that it does not incur flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5942)|
| 1:39:07| given that you're setting it back farther on the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5947)|
| 1:39:12| Thank you, Commissioner Korbelek. I appreciate your questions, and I appreciate you reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| my letter in such detail, going to footnote three. It's a good letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5955)|
| 1:39:19| Let's talk about the floodway. Most of Broadway to the west is in the 100 and 500-year flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5959)|
| 1:39:32| That is not a detriment as far as building the property. The floodway itself, we cannot build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5972)|
| 1:39:39| in, and this property does not touch into the floodway area. It's the 100 and the 500-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5979)|
| 1:39:46| flood zones that you can still build and develop in that this property is in. So I did take note| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5986)|
| 1:39:54| of staff's comment that moving the property up 20 feet might move it further away from the 500-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=5994)|
| 1:40:02| floodplain that it would be in. I would think that's true for anywhere there across Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6002)|
| 1:40:07| I think that's more coincidental than intentional. That's why the CG2 was selected for that. I sat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6007)|
| 1:40:14| through several meetings of recode. I don't recall a justification for CG2 or 3 being to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6014)|
| 1:40:20| move the property further closer to the road to avoid the 500-year flood zone. So I think we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6020)|
| 1:40:28| develop. And one thing as far as your dimensional standards for the road, and I haven't had a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6028)|
| 1:40:33| to look at three, and it does touch on footnote three, so good. Chair Phillips won't cut me off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6033)|
| 1:40:40| for going too far afield here. The concept plan that was originally attached to the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6040)|
| 1:40:47| application was an outdated one, so I wanted to provide an up-to-date concept plan, which that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6047)|
| 1:40:53| was attached to as exhibit A to my letter. And you'll see one of the things that this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6053)|
| 1:41:01| that we're rezoning ends. Sorry, I thought if you bring it up here, it'd be easier to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6061)|
| 1:41:10| Go down to exhibit A on my letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6070)|
| 1:41:17| The property ends along the line. You can see the green, which is a grass area now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6077)|
| 1:41:26| The property line ends at that location. We are actually going to be building beyond this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6086)|
| 1:41:31| property for this concept. It would remain CG2. It does not have to be, the zoning does not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6091)|
| 1:41:38| to be changed for there to be additional parking access and there to be a dumpster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| there at the CG1. So we only need a CG1 so we can move the property back further away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6102)|
| 1:41:49| but that back parcel, which will be platted and combined into one lot that would be still owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6109)|
| 1:41:57| by Mr. Osborne's group, we would just have a ground lease for it, would remain CG2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6117)|
| 1:42:03| But that was the reason I wanted to make sure we had an updated concept plan, but it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6123)|
| 1:42:06| as you see, give us more space to be able to make our concept work, which was one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| comments that you had. So I hope that answered your question regarding footnote three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6132)|
| 1:42:18| Thank you, Mr. Bolling. I still strongly maintain that you failed to meet the decision criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6138)|
| 1:42:25| and I will be opposing your request. Chair recognizes commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6145)|
| 1:42:30| I think staff has been correct that this should stay CG2. And a couple of things I'm thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6150)|
| 1:42:38| about, if we, this portion of Broadway, if we want, I think the design guidelines that CG2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6158)|
| 1:42:45| offers are very important, and even more so in this location than the one in Kingston Pike that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6165)|
| 1:42:49| we talked about previously, because of the amount of residential property that surrounds this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6169)|
| 1:42:55| it's just one block off of Broadway. I think that this is a perfect location to keep those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6175)|
| 1:43:02| CG2 offers in place. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Eason. Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6182)|
| 1:43:12| Yes, thank you, Chair Phillips. You know, I don't know, I'm having a hard time not being able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6192)|
| 1:43:22| support what the applicant wants to do here. You know, this downzoning from CG2 to CG1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6202)|
| 1:43:31| on this site, I mean, you look at this site, and it is small. I mean, it's a small, challenging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6211)|
| 1:43:38| site. And, you know, without this downzoning, it is, it's very difficult to develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6218)|
| 1:43:46| And I don't know how many people, you know, remember the history, you know, of this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6226)|
| 1:43:52| property. But, you know, at one time, it really kind of had a rough looking, you know, kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6232)|
| 1:44:00| maybe a pawn shop or something like that on there for a while. And this just seems like it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6240)|
| 1:44:06| a nice upgrade, you know, for the area. We've got a, this business take five oil change, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6246)|
| 1:44:12| know if you've looked them up on the web or anything or had an experience with them. But,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6252)|
| 1:44:17| I mean, they're a top notch business. I mean, it's a clean operation. It seems like it just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6257)|
| 1:44:23| it'd be a great asset, you know, to that Fountain City area. So, you know, the more I talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6263)|
| 1:44:29| this, I think I would support, you know, the downzoning from CG2 to CG1. Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6269)|
| 1:44:39| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith. Yeah, I'm kind of in agreement with Lou on this. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6279)|
| 1:44:46| do not. I kind of am concerned that, you know, we did this, the property was previously zoned C3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6286)|
| 1:44:54| I mean, I'm pretty sure that under C3, this gentleman would be able to, and the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6294)|
| 1:44:59| owner would be able to move forward and build a new building and create a new business right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6299)|
| 1:45:05| in a great location. And because they don't want to be 20 feet from the curb, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6305)|
| 1:45:12| they're going to have to either sit there with this old building and release it the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6312)|
| 1:45:17| It just doesn't seem right to me. So I'm going to support the rezoning. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6317)|
| 1:45:23| Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6323)|
| 1:45:26| Thank you, Chair Phillips. I'm going to say this with great humility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6326)|
| 1:45:34| One, you know, I was very active in the, I'm going to call it the Recode Roadshow. I was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6334)|
| 1:45:40| I think, the only active commercial developer advocating for it. I was so involved, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6340)|
| 1:45:46| that I was too narrowly focused on where our own properties were. And because of that, much of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6346)|
| 1:45:53| you see in Bearden, you'll see CG1, even when it abuts neighborhoods on a major arterial. I wish I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6353)|
| 1:46:04| would have been a little bit, I guess, more expansive in my thoughts, because CG1 gives the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6364)|
| 1:46:15| owner flexibility to move the buildings around. It doesn't change the uses, but it gives them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6375)|
| 1:46:22| flexibility to move buildings around. So now, we're using CG2 more as a weapon against these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6382)|
| 1:46:30| areas. And I think, and this is my opinion only, that we have over applied CG2 on these major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6390)|
| 1:46:38| arterials, where they should have been CG1. And we focus on nodes, like when there are one street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6398)|
| 1:46:46| off, like Holmberg, for instance, you have a less intense road that buffers a major arterial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6406)|
| 1:46:53| Kingston Pike, from Holmberg. That's a great place for CG2 and CG3. So for that reason, I just, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6413)|
| 1:47:01| think we're going to have to go back and we're going to have to reassess this. I think council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6421)|
| 1:47:05| has identified that in their last vote of, they had a 9-0 vote on a very, very similar case just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6425)|
| 1:47:15| few days ago. So I'm going to support the applicant. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6435)|
| 1:47:19| CHAIR BAILET Thank you. Chair recognizes Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6439)|
| 1:47:22| COMMISSIONER KORBELIK Yes, thank you. I simply want to point out that the justifications presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6442)|
| 1:47:32| in approving the CG1 are really beyond the bounds of the Planning Commission decision criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6452)|
| 1:47:40| in as much as concern about the small site. Again, that's something that the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6460)|
| 1:47:47| needs to find a site that would accommodate the use. And the misapplication of the CG2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6467)|
| 1:47:55| zone is not in our purview. I might be wrong here, but I'll ask Mr. Wise, it's not in our purview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6475)|
| 1:48:02| to make a single site decision based on a philosophical difference with the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6482)|
| 1:48:09| Mr. Wise, could you step in here for a second and tell me if I'm off base?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6489)|
| 1:48:14| MR. WISE Yes. First of all, I have a poor connection. So some of the conversation is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6494)|
| 1:48:25| cutting in and out. But I think you're in, I think the question is focused on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6505)|
| 1:48:31| what the latitude is of the Planning Commission on this, or could you help me out? Because portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6511)|
| 1:48:37| of what you said, I was unable to hear. MS. KORBELIK I'll summarize, but step in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6517)|
| 1:48:42| Commissioners, if I say it incorrectly, there has been a movement to approve the CG1 request based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6522)|
| 1:48:50| on the small size of the property that would translate into a need to have flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6530)|
| 1:48:57| and the fact that there's an opinion that the CG2 zone is misapplied. And I actually don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6537)|
| 1:49:04| disagree with the CG2 misapplication, but I'm just not sure that we can use that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6544)|
| 1:49:11| to justify approval of a CG1 request. MR. WISE Okay, I see. Well, it is a bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6551)|
| 1:49:19| of a dilemma. The recode curiously contains a provision that you can't rezone unless there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6559)|
| 1:49:27| been a change surrounding the property. And so, you know, you're a year and a half into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6567)|
| 1:49:36| the new code, and it would be hard under any circumstance to justify the idea that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6576)|
| 1:49:42| been a change. So what we've seen is, and as Ms. Hill's referencing back in the Bearden property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6582)|
| 1:49:50| and the one out on Kingston Pike, this body has on at least one occasion has chosen to ignore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6590)|
| 1:50:02| that prohibition, and City Council likewise has chosen to ignore the prohibition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6602)|
| 1:50:10| And if it's the consensus of this body and City Council consistent with what Mr. Hill has said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6610)|
| 1:50:17| that the CG2 may have been overapplied, the recode itself has kind of tied your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6617)|
| 1:50:26| They should have thought that through. I think it's just a flaw in the structure of the new code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6626)|
| 1:50:32| It's a very strange provision. I don't know how it got inserted, but there it is. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6632)|
| 1:50:39| you really don't have latitude unless you can specifically find what change circumstance has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| occurred. The dimensional provisions, I don't really have an opinion on that. I mean, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6644)|
| 1:50:50| the sort of thing that is your problem. It's not a legal issue. You've got to determine whether or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| not that has any bearing on the shifting of the size. I can see, well, whatever I can see is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6655)|
| 1:51:02| irrelevant. That is not a legal question. That's a policy decision that you need to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| Thank you, Mr. Wise. Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6667)|
| 1:51:17| Thank you, Pat. I agree with Commissioner Hill. And I would argue that there indeed has been a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6677)|
| 1:51:26| change in the fact that the code was applied blanketly across this in the beginning. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6686)|
| 1:51:35| believe that, I believe this recode, although I did not vote for it, said that several times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6695)|
| 1:51:41| for, and this is an example of why. I think it's a good plan, but I also think that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6701)|
| 1:51:52| individual cases that, where the plan doesn't necessarily fit. And I think this is one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6712)|
| 1:51:59| And what they're proposing is not altogether different than any other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6719)|
| 1:52:03| than anything around it. It's not abutting any residential. And I think, I think we do need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6723)|
| 1:52:11| change it. And I think an error in the code, I'm not mistaken, there used to be, if we found an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6731)|
| 1:52:18| error in the code, then that would be a basis for making our decision. And I think that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6738)|
| 1:52:26| That opportunity's there. I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| You're correct. The current code also allows change in the case of an error. But it'd be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6749)|
| 1:52:35| stretch to say that all the allocations of the C2, the CG2 was an error citywide. I'm not sure you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6755)|
| 1:52:43| can go quite that far. But if there is a manifest error in the. What I said was, I believe this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6763)|
| 1:52:50| is. And I think, and I think based on the fact that it was a blanket over the area, I'm not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6770)|
| 1:52:57| I'm not saying it doesn't apply, it doesn't make sense for the area in general. But I'm saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6777)|
| 1:53:03| there's certainly lots and lots that it doesn't necessarily work. And I think this is one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6783)|
| 1:53:12| That's all I'm trying to say. But that's my, and that's my opinion. I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6792)|
| 1:53:17| everybody on this commission has a right to disagree with me, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6797)|
| 1:53:24| Thank you, Commissioner Rowe. You know, looking at the map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6804)|
| 1:53:29| you know, I see a lot of small parcels. And that's indicative throughout the city. You look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6809)|
| 1:53:34| Kingston Pike, you look at Chapman Highway, you look at Broadway, Clinton Highway, you see a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6814)|
| 1:53:41| of these very small parcels that makes compliance with some of the new provisions, the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6821)|
| 1:53:48| difficult, if not possible. But I'm still concerned that we're doing this on a case by case. And if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6828)|
| 1:53:55| there's a reason to change this all to CG1, let's do it all at one time. Let's not pick one lot at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6835)|
| 1:54:04| a time because it loses its total integrity. You know, if CG1 is not appropriate on this site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6844)|
| 1:54:11| it's not appropriate on probably 50% of the sites out here. So let's do it all at one time rather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6851)|
| 1:54:19| than piecemealing it, as we did on Kingston Pike. And I guess that's Council's decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6859)|
| 1:54:25| but I think we need to look at it more broadly. Chair recognizes Commissioner Dent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6865)|
| 1:54:31| This is a rhetorical question, but I've heard a couple of times that the recode and the recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6871)|
| 1:54:38| zoning change has been a changing condition. So my question rhetorically would be how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6878)|
| 1:54:45| how long would we consider that a changing condition? Because that would apply to every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6885)|
| 1:54:49| single piece of land that we discussed. And I don't I don't know if that would be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6889)|
| 1:54:56| a changing condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| Miss Dent, who are you asking that question to? It's a rhetorical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| Okay. Thank you. Commissioner Smith. Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6904)|
| 1:55:10| Yeah, I just wanted to, you know, talk to Sandra a little bit or just kind of reflect on what she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6910)|
| 1:55:16| was saying. You know, if we wait on all of this to be done at once and entire strips of CG2 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6916)|
| 1:55:24| change over, it'll never happen. And I think our job as commissioners is to, you know, if we just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6924)|
| 1:55:30| want to follow what's written in the code and just we don't even need to be here, but we're here to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6930)|
| 1:55:35| apply judgment and discernment to situations like this, where this property owner through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6935)|
| 1:55:41| recode or through whatever has a situation beyond his control that limits what he can do and takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6941)|
| 1:55:47| away what he previously can do. And I just feel like I'm not afraid to rezone things one at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6947)|
| 1:55:53| time. That's how we will get the attention on correcting whatever problems are in recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6953)|
| 1:55:58| And so I think as commissioners, this is what this is the reason we're here. So I just wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6958)|
| 1:56:03| to make that point. Thank you for your comment. Steer recognizes Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6963)|
| 1:56:10| Thank you. Looks like most of the hands are down and if it's an appropriate time and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6970)|
| 1:56:16| maybe even willing to be on the losing side on this one, but I think it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6976)|
| 1:56:20| motion that I'm willing to make and that is that we do approve CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6980)|
| 1:56:27| Second that. We have a motion by Commissioner Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| second by Commissioner Scott Smith to approve CG1 general commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6991)|
| 1:56:38| Commissioner Hill? Yes. Sorry to interject. Can you please provide we will need a rationale for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=6998)|
| 1:56:45| that out of those? I'm going to say change in condition and it is compatible with the surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7005)|
| 1:56:51| area. And also, I just want to add and it's not necessarily a reason, but it is certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7011)|
| 1:56:57| something that these bodies have weighed in in the past. And that is just a few months ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7017)|
| 1:57:04| they had they lost their right to do what they're asking to do today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7024)|
| 1:57:08| Amy, are you satisfied with that? Thank you, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7028)|
| 1:57:16| All right. Thank you. We have a motion and a second. Call the roll, Ms. Edmonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7036)|

| 1:58:37| Thank you, Ms. Edmonds. Let's take a about a 10 minute break and we'll come back and we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7117)|
| 1:58:44| start on number item number 15. All right, let's start out with agenda item number 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7124)|
| 1:58:52| The applicant is Igor Chabon. The location is northeast side of Chirp Pit Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7132)|
| 1:58:59| northwest of Jenkins Road. Track size is 2.1 acres. Present zoning is agriculture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7139)|
| 1:59:06| and the applicant is requesting RA low density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7146)|
| 1:59:12| Staff recommendation, approve RA low density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| because it is consistent with the surrounding development on the Northwest County Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7156)|
| 1:59:22| Mr. Chabon, are you available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7162)|
| 1:59:33| This is Liz. I do not see Mr. Chabon in the attendees list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7173)|
| 1:59:39| Okay. How about Mr. Paul Rikus? Is Mr. Rikus available? If not, we will...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7179)|
| 1:59:56| This is Dick Graf. I move we approve staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7196)|
| 2:00:03| Are you there? Hello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| Mr. Rikus, yes, you're available? Hello?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7206)|
| 2:00:09| Yes. Can you hear us? Yes, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7209)|
| 2:00:12| All right. Your name and address, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| Okay. Well, my name is Paul Rikus. I live at 1417 Chirp Pit Road. I am across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7215)|
| 2:00:23| diagonally from the property that this property here. Yes. And I have major flooding issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7223)|
| 2:00:35| when we get a large rain. And over the years, it's gotten to a point to where this past summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7235)|
| 2:00:43| it approached just within feet of my garage. My neighbors, all my neighbors on my side of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7243)|
| 2:00:52| they get hammered with it where their whole entire yard is a pond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7252)|
| 2:00:57| all the way probably down to, if you can see La Palona, and then probably down to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7257)|
| 2:01:04| Shaliford Road, there are issues that far down. And I'm concerned that any development across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7264)|
| 2:01:14| the road for me will just compound the flooding issues that I'm experiencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7274)|
| 2:01:22| for the last 29 years of being a resident here. And I just want your consideration when you make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7282)|
| 2:01:29| your decision. And one other thing I'd like you to be aware of is when they put the driveway in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7289)|
| 2:01:38| a few weeks ago, it enters the road directly across the street from where there's a drop-off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7298)|
| 2:01:47| of about 8 to 10 feet. I don't know if you can see it. But their drive comes in right where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7307)|
| 2:01:54| there's a drop-off right across the road. And it's just a traffic hazard also. The traffic comes down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7314)|
| 2:02:02| the hill probably 50 miles an hour in a 30-mile-an-hour zone. And everybody knows that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7322)|
| 2:02:07| a cut-through road. So I just appreciate your consideration and your decision. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7327)|
| 2:02:13| Mr. Richards, thank you very much. Mr. Snowden, do you have any comments you'd like to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7333)|
| 2:02:20| regarding the flooding in this area? There's a blue line on the quad map just to the left of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7340)|
| 2:02:33| this site as you're going through the road that comes across the front of the property. And there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7353)|
| 2:02:38| a 36-inch pipe under the road at that location. He probably would need to have a stream buffer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7358)|
| 2:02:46| but it just crosses the very front of his property. All right. Do you foresee this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7366)|
| 2:02:56| rezoning having any effect on Mr. Richards' property? Well, this probably will be a very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7376)|
| 2:03:05| very small portion of the total watershed that goes to that 36-inch pipe. As you can see, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7385)|
| 2:03:12| numerous residential lots, 10,000-square-foot lots in the vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7392)|
| 2:03:21| Thank you. We do have a motion by Commissioner Graf, seconded by Commissioner Buston. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7401)|
| 2:03:29| correct? Yes. All right. Ms. Edmonds, would you call the roll, please? Commissioner Eaton? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7409)|
| 2:03:39| Commissioner Eason? Yes. Commissioner Buston? Yes. Commissioner Dent? Yes. Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7419)|

| 2:04:20| Thank you. Next item is agenda item number 19. The applicant is Benjamin Mullins. Location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7460)|

| 2:05:13| and a duplex on 59PD010. Staff recommendation is to approve RN2, single-family residential neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7513)|
| 2:05:25| F Floodway zoning on all properties, and Hillside protection overlay on 3000 Greenway Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7525)|
| 2:05:32| because it is consistent with existing development. Mr. Mullins, are you available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7532)|
| 2:05:39| I am. Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500, here for the owner of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7539)|
| 2:05:45| Ronnie Welch. All right. And I'm not seeing any opposition to have signed up to speak. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7545)|
| 2:05:52| Mr. Mullins, you have five minutes. Thank you, Chairman Phillips. This zoning started out as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7552)|
| 2:06:00| prior zoning equivalent request by Mr. Welch. He filed it, I guess, back in September of 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7560)|
| 2:06:08| and it was scheduled to be heard in November. When he went to fill out the application for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7568)|
| 2:06:13| prior zoning equivalency, he was wanting to maintain his ability to develop the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7573)|
| 2:06:18| as multifamily. It currently has seven multifamily units on, I believe, 2910,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7578)|
| 2:06:24| and he wanted to be able to expand that at some point. The application was accepted for RN5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7584)|
| 2:06:32| However, as we talked about in other discussions this afternoon, at some point after adopting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7592)|
| 2:06:39| the new zoning ordinance, City Council had removed from consideration RN5 from the MDR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7599)|
| 2:06:48| sector plan designation. This property and basically that entire block of properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7608)|
| 2:06:54| east of the church there between the industrial is an MDR sector plan designation. So, when Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7614)|
| 2:07:04| Welch filled out the application, he thought he was filling it out in a way where he could get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7624)|
| 2:07:09| the RN5 without needing a sector plan or a one-year plan amendment. When that was pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7629)|
| 2:07:15| he asked me to get involved. I postponed the application until January so we can consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7635)|
| 2:07:21| the one-year plan amendment per the bylaws. A one-year plan amendment is only considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7641)|
| 2:07:25| every quarter in January being the next one. We got staff's recommendation and looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7645)|
| 2:07:32| the criteria for a sector plan amendment and also looking at the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7652)|
| 2:07:36| which does allow for RN4 as an alternative that would still allow multifamily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7656)|
| 2:07:42| under most circumstances a subsequent special use application once they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7662)|
| 2:07:47| exceeded a certain number of units. We revised our application to no longer need or seek the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7667)|
| 2:07:53| one-year plan or the sector plan amendment and just move forward with the RN4 because it would allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7673)|
| 2:07:58| the ultimate goal for Mr. Welch is that to maintain what is there and what he could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7678)|
| 2:08:04| before the zoning ordinance changed. R2 prior to the new zoning ordinance allowed multifamily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7684)|
| 2:08:13| He had a multifamily development and won the lots and he wants to be able to do that across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7693)|
| 2:08:19| that. So RN4 is consistent with the current sector plan. It's consistent with the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7699)|
| 2:08:24| one-year plan. It will allow him to continue his property to develop the property the way he wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7704)|
| 2:08:31| to develop and he's owned this for quite some time. He had the first zoning issue come up in 1984 when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7711)|
| 2:08:37| he got the R2 to begin with. It won't take away any of his rights. It won't relegate what's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7717)|
| 2:08:44| to a pre-existing non-conforming use and it gives him flexibility in developing this property. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7724)|
| 2:08:50| the reason, you know, they are large lots but they're long and narrow lots with some hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7730)|
| 2:08:57| protection and they're bisected by a floodway. So in order to do any type of development you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7737)|
| 2:09:02| really got to focus it, you know, along the front where the road is out of the floodway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7742)|
| 2:09:08| and being able to cluster that development and create multifamily with the subsequent special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7748)|
| 2:09:12| use application under most circumstances makes the most sense for Mr. Welch. So that's why we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7752)|
| 2:09:18| asking for RN4 instead of RN5 because it's consistent with the sector plan and it allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7758)|
| 2:09:23| him to maintain what he had before and what he would like to do in the future. So with that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7763)|
| 2:09:28| would respectfully ask that you provide the zoning that we're requesting and rezone this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7768)|
| 2:09:34| property to RN4. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Mullins. You know, looking at the zoning map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7774)|
| 2:09:40| you know, I certainly don't see how we can justify RN4. Why it might be RN4 might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7780)|
| 2:09:47| consistent with the sector plan. I just can't personally see that deviation in the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7787)|
| 2:09:58| when you look at the surrounding properties. I think the staff's recommendation is spot on. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7798)|
| 2:10:04| Chair will recognize Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7804)|
| 2:10:14| Thank you, Chair Phillips. This property has more to it than a simple request to go back to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7814)|
| 2:10:23| the previous zoning prior to RECOG would provide. It's a complex situation both in history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7823)|
| 2:10:32| and its development. And I'd like to commend the staff report in doing a really good job on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7832)|
| 2:10:39| clearly describing all of this as well as the historic purpose of that previous R2 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7839)|
| 2:10:48| Frankly, I don't see how the request for an RN4 zone makes any sense here. We've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7848)|
| 2:10:57| very, very good restrictions, physical restrictions on the property with the flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7857)|
| 2:11:03| We also have neighborhood character. And finally, I just again want to reaffirm that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7863)|
| 2:11:12| should look at the decision criteria. As we look at specific sites, we run into that gray area of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7872)|
| 2:11:24| being helpful and or becoming arbitrary and capricious. And my big concern is the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7884)|
| 2:11:33| Commission action done at a nearby property 3106 Greenway Drive, which had come in for a higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7893)|
| 2:11:42| zone designation RN3 and the Planning Commission at that point recommended RN2. I suggest that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7902)|
| 2:11:51| continue with that sentiment and look at RN2 for this property. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7911)|
| 2:11:58| Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith. Yeah, my question is for Mr. Mullins. Did I hear you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7918)|
| 2:12:07| did you say that the owner has an adjacent property that has an apartment complex on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7927)|
| 2:12:13| It's actually part of this property, Mr. Smith. If you look at, I think it's 2910. It is the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7933)|
| 2:12:21| and I'm moving my cursor over your screen and realize you can't see that. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7941)|
| 2:12:25| It's the property closest to the church, the furthest east. There are two buildings on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7945)|
| 2:12:32| that property. The front building is a single family residence. I think it's leased out. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7952)|
| 2:12:39| then the second building, there's seven units in a multifamily development there. And he wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7959)|
| 2:12:45| be able to continue that development along these properties and to develop more multifamily, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7965)|
| 2:12:51| was what he had available to him previous to the zoning ordinance change. Okay. And then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7971)|
| 2:13:00| now is that, does RN1 allow that or is it just a non, it's not? It's non-conforming. But it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7980)|
| 2:13:08| R2 before. And R2 would allow it before. Okay. All right. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7988)|
| 2:13:16| I would like to make a motion, if I may, if it's a good time for that, Chair Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=7996)|
| 2:13:39| I would like to make a motion to approve RN2 per the staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8019)|
| 2:13:49| Second. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8029)|
| 2:13:57| I'm not sure. Hi, everybody. I'm sorry. This is Mike Reynolds over at the Planning Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8037)|
| 2:14:02| But our internet just went down. So Chair Phillips has been kicked off the Zoom call here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8042)|
| 2:14:11| And once we get things back up and going, we might be able to get on with some junk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8051)|
| 2:14:17| of the internet or cell phone internet. But we'll get back on as soon as we can. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8057)|
| 2:14:23| Thanks, Mike. Do you want to take another break or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8063)|
| 2:14:27| It'd probably be good to take a quick break or at least a pause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8067)|
| 2:14:34| We'll get with you in just a moment, okay? I've got my hand up real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8074)|
| 2:14:40| Okay. Chris, go ahead. I don't really care which way this thing goes. I think, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8080)|
| 2:14:47| what I would offer up as an example to everyone as we talk about, you know, looking at sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8087)|
| 2:14:54| plans, looking at one-year plans, looking at things where you put a blanket use on a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8094)|
| 2:15:02| stretch of property, if you look at the sector plan, and you look at the one-year plan, and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8102)|
| 2:15:07| calls it MDR, just from my background, I think the reason that staff put MDR on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8107)|
| 2:15:15| if you look to either side of this property, you've got it's a major transitional zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8115)|
| 2:15:21| You've got industrial on one end, you've got heavy commercial on one end, and you're backing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8121)|
| 2:15:25| up to the interstate. And so, I've got to only assume that that's why they gave this MDR on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8125)|
| 2:15:32| sector plan and on the one-year plan. Because of that transitional use, you typically would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8132)|
| 2:15:37| transition a higher density type residential in between those uses and backing up to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8137)|
| 2:15:44| And there's already some apartments out there. So, for me, I mean, we've all gone back and forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8144)|
| 2:15:52| on do you keep the integrity of the sector plans and the one-year plans and these new overlays that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8152)|
| 2:16:00| we've done based on recode, or do you not? And so, I guess I'm just submitting that there are times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8160)|
| 2:16:08| when, you know, you just can't get it right all the time on a blanket sector plan or a blanket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8168)|
| 2:16:14| one-year plan or a blanket land use. You kind of have to look at it a little bit independently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8174)|
| 2:16:21| So, that's my soapbox, and I'll let you guys get back to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8181)|
| 2:16:26| Okay. So, I've got Pat on speakerphone, so we can get his vote. I guess let's resume where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8186)|
| 2:16:33| we were. And as I remember, Sandra, you had made a motion. Is that correct? You want to make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8193)|
| 2:16:38| motion again? Yes. I had made a motion to approve the staff recommendation for RN2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8198)|
| 2:16:46| and I'm not quite sure who seconded it. It was me. Okay. So, I've got a motion by Sandra| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8206)|
| 2:16:53| Korbelik and a second by Karen Adams to approve staff recommendation on the rezoning for RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8213)|
| 2:17:02| Could we begin the vote count, please? Oh. So, I'll have to do that, too, I guess, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8222)|
| 2:17:12| Can you hear me, Scott? Oh, I'm in. Hold on. Yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8232)|
| 2:17:14| Laura, we can hear you. Okay. Just bear with me. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8234)|
| 2:17:19| Okay. Commissioner Eaton? I'm just going to respectfully say no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8239)|
| 2:17:25| just because of the sector plan, the one-year plan, and what the applicant's already got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8245)|
| 2:17:29| But it's a very light no. Okay. Commissioner Easton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8249)|
| 2:17:35| Yes. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8255)|
| 2:17:37| Commissioner Buston? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8257)|
| 2:17:40| Commissioner Dent? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8260)|
| 2:17:45| Commissioner Roth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8265)|
| 2:17:53| Commissioner Roth? No. I'm sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8273)|
| 2:17:57| Okay. Commissioner Adams? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8277)|
| 2:18:02| Commissioner Browning? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8282)|
| 2:18:06| Commissioner Phillips? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8286)|
| 2:18:11| Commissioner Graf? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8291)|
| 2:18:15| Commissioner Korbelik? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8295)|
| 2:18:20| Commissioner Scott Smith? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8300)|
| 2:18:24| Commissioner Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8304)|
| 2:18:33| Commissioner Boyer? No. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8313)|
| 2:18:39| That's a no, correct? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8319)|
| 2:18:42| Okay. And Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8322)|
| 2:18:44| No. There are seven ayes and six nays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8324)|
| 2:18:54| Okay. Commissioner Phillips, vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8334)|
| 2:19:00| Okay. So the rezoning passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8340)|
| 2:19:05| Hey, Scott, this is Eddie Smith. I'm just now getting back as well. It appears that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8345)|
| 2:19:10| whatever power outage and stuff knocked all of us out. It took me with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8350)|
| 2:19:18| Okay. Did you cast a vote, or were you here for the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8358)|
| 2:19:23| I was not here for the discussion. I came in as you all were starting to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8363)|
| 2:19:27| Okay. Well, the vote's already been done, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8367)|
| 2:19:30| Yeah, and that's fine. Just wanted to let y'all know for future ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8370)|
| 2:19:35| Okay. So I guess we'll move on to item number 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8375)|
| 2:19:41| That is 4917 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8381)|
| 2:19:46| That would be a concept plan. Does staff want to give a little discussion on this or a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8386)|
| 2:19:57| comment on this before we go to opposition? Yes, I can. Let me see if I can get my screen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8397)|
| 2:20:08| to share here. Get to this site. I'm not sure if it's going to work on my phone or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8408)|
| 2:20:13| since I'm using it as a hotspot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8413)|
| 2:20:21| Excuse me one sec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8421)|
| 2:20:29| Mike, I can come back to you if you want me to. Let me go to, is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8429)|
| 2:20:34| Is the applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8434)|
| 2:20:39| Applicant for Josh Sanderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8439)|
| 2:20:45| Yes, applicant's here. Josh Sanderson, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8445)|
| 2:20:48| Okay. Would you like to go first or would you like all of us to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8448)|
| 2:20:51| Applicant for Josh Sanderson. Is there? Yes. Applicant here, Josh Sanderson. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8451)|
| 2:21:01| Okay. Would you like to go first or would you like opposition to go first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8461)|
| 2:21:05| I'll let opposition go first. Okay. Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8465)|
| 2:21:09| Yes, Mr. Chairman. Oh, Kevin Murphy. Yes. Kevin Murphy. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8469)|
| 2:21:16| Is there any other opposition? Okay, Kevin, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8476)|
| 2:21:22| Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road. Today, I'm speaking on behalf| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8482)|
| 2:21:28| of Murphy Farm, the Shannon Valley Homeowners Association, the Summer Rose Homeowners Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8488)|
| 2:21:34| and Nature's Way Montessori School, all of which are located on Murphy Road. You've received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8494)|
| 2:21:39| comments from the leaders of all these groups through the public comments link. Patrick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8499)|
| 2:21:43| for the Shannon Valley HOA, Doug for Summer Rose HOA, and Mary from Nature's Way Montessori| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8503)|
| 2:21:47| School. We have some ideas for improving the concept plan in front of you and making it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8507)|
| 2:21:52| more harmonious with the character and the nature of this area and with adjacent uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8512)|
| 2:21:57| First, we believe sidewalks should be required both within the subdivision and also, importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8517)|
| 2:22:02| along Murphy Road. This would be in harmony with the character of the adjacent Shannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8522)|
| 2:22:07| Valley Farms subdivision, which has interior sidewalks on most of its streets. More importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8527)|
| 2:22:14| this is something for student safety. Nature's Way Montessori School is across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8534)|
| 2:22:18| and they have students that attend from Summer Rose and Shannon Valley today. It's logical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8538)|
| 2:22:24| that this new subdivision will also have some students who attend Nature's Way. We think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8544)|
| 2:22:30| there should be safe walking and biking options for students to walk and bike to the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8550)|
| 2:22:34| from the subdivision. And by providing a safe pedestrian option, it actually helps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8554)|
| 2:22:39| reduce traffic because you won't have parents that have to take their students to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8559)|
| 2:22:44| in the morning. Traffic is definitely an issue in this area. So we really would ask you first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8564)|
| 2:22:50| our first request is for sidewalks, both interior and exterior. In addition, we think it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8570)|
| 2:22:55| be important to require a pedestrian crossing to be placed on Murphy Road. The new subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8575)|
| 2:23:02| is across the street from Shannon Valley, and one of its exits, which is Horstall Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8582)|
| 2:23:08| There's several miles of sidewalks on public roads in that subdivision, and you can imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8588)|
| 2:23:15| that will probably be an important walking area that residents of this new subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8595)|
| 2:23:19| may actually want to access for recreational and for exercise. Pedestrian crossing on Murphy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8599)|
| 2:23:24| Road would also facilitate safe student access to Nature's Way Montessori, and again, this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8604)|
| 2:23:31| makes it more harmonious and compatible with neighboring uses. The third thing we'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8611)|
| 2:23:37| to look at is there's traffic and speeding on Murphy Road. Shannon Valley Farms, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8617)|
| 2:23:43| estimate that about half of their traffic enters and exits through Horstall Lane, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8623)|
| 2:23:48| is opposite the entrance from this proposed subdivision. Residents there already encounter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8628)|
| 2:23:53| significant delays in the morning when they're trying to turn left onto Murphy Road, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8633)|
| 2:23:57| if you have another 61 units across the street and they're turning right at that same intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8637)|
| 2:24:01| you're going to have additional traffic conflict. One creative idea that we would suggest is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8641)|
| 2:24:09| the idea for actually installing a roundabout at that location, which would really accommodate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8649)|
| 2:24:14| well the through traffic as well as the turning movements that are needed. It also has the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8654)|
| 2:24:19| benefit of actually slowing down traffic, and the folks that live closest to that street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8659)|
| 2:24:24| known as Murphy Road, it's a 40-mile-an-hour speed limit. Actual traveled speeds are usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8664)|
| 2:24:29| around 50 miles an hour, sometimes up to 60 miles an hour, so a roundabout would actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8669)|
| 2:24:33| force, be a traffic calming device, would force a slowing there. If they don't do a roundabout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8673)|
| 2:24:41| then we really think that engineering and the developer, they need to put in a left-hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8681)|
| 2:24:46| turn lane onto the new subdivision, and there probably needs to be a left-hand turn lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8686)|
| 2:24:51| mirroring that to provide access into Shannon Valley Farm. So there's some improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8691)|
| 2:24:55| here that we haven't seen engineering identify as a need, but we really think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8695)|
| 2:25:02| Fourth, Knoxville City Engineering could look at signalization timing, the stoplights on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8702)|
| 2:25:07| each end of Murphy Road. That would certainly help. Commissioner Adams, you noticed you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8707)|
| 2:25:12| asked about Washington Pike widening a few days ago at agenda review. The city is widening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8712)|
| 2:25:17| Washington Pike all the way out to Murphy Road, so that should alleviate some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8717)|
| 2:25:21| traffic backups, but we still have some volume issues to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8721)|
| 2:25:26| Our final request is a landscaping screen should be required along Murphy Road. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8726)|
| 2:25:31| a landscaping screen just across the street on Shannon Valley Farms for those houses where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8731)|
| 2:25:36| their rears face Murphy Road. Most of the houses out in the rural area, their front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8736)|
| 2:25:41| faces the primary road, but this one, you have the backs facing it, so we think a landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8741)|
| 2:25:48| screen would be there. So that's five things we think would be really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8748)|
| 2:25:52| good improvements. I know that's a lot to deal with right now. I would suggest that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8752)|
| 2:25:56| you discuss and determine which ones of those you want to make requirements, and then probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8756)|
| 2:26:01| postpone this, because it will take a little bit of time to get that on the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8761)|
| 2:26:04| drawing or the staff recommendation. And one thing that all of us struggle with is making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8764)|
| 2:26:09| sure that the intent and the things that are voted on actually are visible to the personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8769)|
| 2:26:16| that do permitting and engineering. So we respectfully ask that you discuss that, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8776)|
| 2:26:22| possibly if there's enough that needs to be updated, you may need to postpone it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8782)|
| 2:26:26| On behalf of all these groups, thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8786)|
| 2:26:31| Okay. Great. I believe Pat is back. So I think we were going to hear from either other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8791)|
| 2:26:39| opposition if there is any, and then the applicant. Go ahead, Pat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8799)|
| 2:26:42| Yeah, let's go ahead. Sorry about that. We had a little technical difficulties here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8802)|
| 2:26:47| I'll turn it over to Mr. Sanderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8807)|
| 2:26:54| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8814)|
| 2:26:55| I see you have not spoken yet, Josh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8815)|
| 2:26:56| I have not. Thank you, Chair. And thank you, Mr. Murphy, for your thorough summary. We've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8816)|
| 2:27:01| exchanged an email or two about this. Just a little background for the commission. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8821)|
| 2:27:07| is, well, I'm speaking on behalf of Smithfield Homes. Smithfield Homes is the developer and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8827)|
| 2:27:13| builder of Shannon Valley Farms, a subdivision we did back probably a decade ago. I've always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8833)|
| 2:27:21| had intentions of adding this as another phase of Shannon Valley. It was villas, it was condos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8841)|
| 2:27:26| it was everything between anything that you could sell between the downturn and now. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8846)|
| 2:27:33| we've said on and said on. So it is a challenging piece because of the topography. It's got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8853)|
| 2:27:37| some flood. It's got some, it's just got issues. And that's honestly, if you know Smithfield| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8857)|
| 2:27:41| Homes, we don't leave, we don't leave land undisturbed unless there are issues that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8861)|
| 2:27:45| can't get over. So we've finally gotten over the issues. I know internal sidewalks are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8865)|
| 2:27:52| not a requirement. And we appreciate that from from the planning standpoint, but as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8872)|
| 2:27:59| a builder, but as a builder and a developer, we do like sidewalks, in the sense that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8879)|
| 2:28:06| does keep people off the street. So if we have the opportunity, and it's not a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8886)|
| 2:28:09| with driveways and utilities, we will most likely install them. I'm not promising that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8889)|
| 2:28:14| but that is an amenity that we think people do put a value on is the sidewalk. I'm happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8894)|
| 2:28:21| that planning allows us to have that discretion because you have challenging sites in East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8901)|
| 2:28:26| Tennessee that cannot accommodate sidewalks and driveways and everything that needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8906)|
| 2:28:30| go into there. So if we can accommodate a sidewalk, especially maybe on the main trunk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8910)|
| 2:28:34| line of this property, or this concept, we will. If we decide to access the amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8914)|
| 2:28:42| across the street in Shannon Valley that we built with the neighborhood years ago, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8922)|
| 2:28:46| will install a crosswalk. We'll talk to Leo and traffic on that already, knowing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8926)|
| 2:28:51| if people are going over there to swim and everything, it does need to have a crosswalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8931)|
| 2:28:55| and flashing light or whatever they're going to require. So that will be installed. A traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8935)|
| 2:29:01| study, I literally got a letter this morning from Cannon and Cannon, the engineer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8941)|
| 2:29:07| we hired to do a traffic impact study. It wasn't a full blown study because it's under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8947)|
| 2:29:13| the threshold, but there was a, when we did Shannon Valley, there was always a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8953)|
| 2:29:19| if we do this phase, what all needs to happen to Murphy Road. So the results are in on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8959)|
| 2:29:24| and I think Mike got emailed it from Cannon and Cannon this morning, and a left turn lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8964)|
| 2:29:27| is warranted into the new subdivision that we'll be doing. So that's kind of news to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8967)|
| 2:29:31| this commission and news to staff that literally just came in. So we will be required to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8971)|
| 2:29:35| a left hand turn lane. I think that's it. We've been sitting on the site. We're ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8975)|
| 2:29:43| to go. We're ready to move some bulldozers in, get TDEC approval and get started on here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8983)|
| 2:29:48| and start building some more affordable housing as we can. And I will yield the rest of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8988)|
| 2:29:54| time for any questions or comments from either opposition or staff or this commission. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=8994)|
| 2:30:00| you all for your time. Thank you, Mr. Sanderson. Chair will recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9000)|
| 2:30:05| Commissioner Adams. Thank you. I really appreciate what Mr. Murphy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9005)|
| 2:30:14| shared about the opportunities that this development offers for connectivity in this area. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9014)|
| 2:30:23| it also, I think, speaks highly that he was representing so many different voices in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9023)|
| 2:30:30| community, not just his, but other developments there and the school. I wanted to ask him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9030)|
| 2:30:41| if he could, or if someone on the who's controlling the screen could sort of indicate where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9041)|
| 2:30:47| roundabout was being suggested. Yeah, it would be at that existing intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9047)|
| 2:30:55| where Horsetail Lane and the new intersection would go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9055)|
| 2:30:59| Okay. So that would be on Murphy Road to help with that kind of traffic congestion and speeding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9059)|
| 2:31:08| Yes, ma'am. Okay. I think that is a great suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9068)|
| 2:31:16| And I had a question as well about the widening of Washington Pike. And when we were provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9076)|
| 2:31:26| a link by Interim Director Brooks to the Washington Pike expansion, and I wasn't confident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9086)|
| 2:31:37| that it was still retaining the bike lanes and sidewalks that were part of it originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9097)|
| 2:31:43| Can anyone from planning clarify that? I'm going to see if Curtis Williams is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9103)|
| 2:31:52| And if he can speak to this, this is still being studied and underway. It's still under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9112)|
| 2:31:56| development. He might have some additional insight. He's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9116)|
| 2:32:03| This is Curtis Williams with City Engineering. I apologize. I don't have additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9123)|
| 2:32:08| That project is something that our Civil Division is taking the lead on. And at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9128)|
| 2:32:15| I don't have those details. Mr. Murphy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9135)|
| 2:32:20| Thank you, Commissioner. I'm really familiar with this and was involved with a lot of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9140)|
| 2:32:25| with City Council and City Engineering recently. They are absolutely planning to do bike lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9145)|
| 2:32:31| Right now they're thinking of a 10-foot wide multi-use path, so biking and sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9151)|
| 2:32:36| That will go all the way from Murphy Road to the interstate. And really importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9156)|
| 2:32:40| it will connect up to New Harvest Park there. Okay. So thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9160)|
| 2:32:48| Because that connectivity was one of the things I am thinking about when I think about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9168)|
| 2:32:55| development and the purpose that sidewalks can play. Because no longer is that sort of a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9175)|
| 2:33:02| to nowhere. But if there's a sidewalk that is coming in from Washington Pike that connects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9182)|
| 2:33:07| to Harvest Park, you've really created this very nice pedestrian thoroughfare to go and do things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9187)|
| 2:33:17| not just walk to one specific location, but to walk from a home in a safe way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9197)|
| 2:33:24| to many different amenities. That's the kind of connectivity that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9204)|
| 2:33:30| we are trying to foster. So I'm excited about the opportunities that this project offers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9210)|
| 2:33:37| It seems in its current existence, the current plan that we're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9217)|
| 2:33:43| it's not taking full advantage of those. And for all of these good ideas, and for that reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9223)|
| 2:33:50| and the connectivity opportunities, I really do believe that a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9230)|
| 2:33:54| might benefit the entire community there. So I will be leaning towards a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9234)|
| 2:33:58| Thank you, Commissioner Adams. Chair recognizes Commissioner Roth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9238)|
| 2:34:06| Thank you, Pat. I can't tell if I'm muted or not. Yeah, I'm on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9246)|
| 2:34:13| Yeah, I think these comments are good. And I'm going to say something here about the subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9253)|
| 2:34:17| planning and the conversations we have. You know, we've got a staff that are professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9257)|
| 2:34:21| about what they do. And they spend a lot of time analyzing these proposals. And they spend a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9261)|
| 2:34:27| of time looking at what works and what doesn't, what conforms to the code, what conforms to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9267)|
| 2:34:33| subdivision regulations. They spend a lot of time doing that. And I don't always agree with everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9273)|
| 2:34:39| the staff says. Obviously, you've seen today, I've actually disagreed a couple of different times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9279)|
| 2:34:45| for various reasons. Having said that, from what I hear, what I've heard the opposition talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9285)|
| 2:34:53| a traffic study and various sundry other things, that's going to be done, or it sounds like maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9293)|
| 2:35:01| it already has been done, and there's going to be turning lanes required. And, you know, because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9301)|
| 2:35:06| think a circle might be a great thing to do, that doesn't necessarily mean it has to. And it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9306)|
| 2:35:13| necessarily mean that we have the ability or should have the ability to force them to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9313)|
| 2:35:18| That would be something I think the county would have to do, and the county would have to weigh in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9318)|
| 2:35:21| on that. And we have engineering, we have requirements in the 13 conditions that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9321)|
| 2:35:29| have to meet engineering, they have to meet all these requirements before they can proceed with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9329)|
| 2:35:34| a subdivision. And I think we get into, I think we get into a lot of times what each individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9334)|
| 2:35:41| commissioner thinks would be nice. And that's great. But I think the time for all that is during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9341)|
| 2:35:46| the planning session, leading up to all this, not to the point where we are now. So I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9346)|
| 2:35:54| make a motion we approve variances one, two, and the alternative design standards one, three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9354)|
| 2:35:59| per staff recommendations. I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9359)|
| 2:36:05| And we have a motion by Commissioner Roth, seconded by Commissioner Scott Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9365)|
| 2:36:09| to approve variances one, two, and alternative design standards one, three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9369)|
| 2:36:14| per staff recommendation. Chair will recognize Commissioner Korbelik.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9374)|
| 2:36:20| Thank you. I have a number of questions for staff. This application confuses me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9380)|
| 2:36:28| I actually even wrote them all out so that I didn't lose any. The first question I have is I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9388)|
| 2:36:35| understand that the recommendation is to approve a development plan of up to 61 detached dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9395)|
| 2:36:42| But we are only looking at a plan for 41 or two. So how can we approve a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9402)|
| 2:36:52| that where we don't see all of it? That's my first question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9412)|
| 2:36:58| This is Mike Reynolds again. So we do have 61 lots on this plan. The staff recommendation is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9418)|
| 2:37:08| have a condition that they can only flat 42 lots before they have to do a traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9428)|
| 2:37:14| to determine whether the turn lane is required at the Murphy Road intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9434)|
| 2:37:20| So we are looking at the full 61 lots. It's just they aren't able to flat the full 61 until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9440)|
| 2:37:28| the traffic study is fully reviewed and approved by staff. And there's an agreement to either turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9448)|
| 2:37:35| in that a turn lane is required or not required. So at this time, we just got information today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9455)|
| 2:37:42| from the applicant regarding the turn lane. So staff hasn't had a chance to really evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9462)|
| 2:37:47| what they've submitted yet. Oh, okay. I thought that the road connection led to the remaining 17| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9467)|
| 2:37:54| lots. So that's an entirely different phase. The applicant owns the remaining property, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9474)|
| 2:38:01| That's correct. Yeah, there's a potential second phase. And it's not PR. Well, it's there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9481)|
| 2:38:11| a part that they would actually be developing. Most likely would be the PR area here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9491)|
| 2:38:18| The RV portion of the property is on the north side of the creek. So they would have to cross| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9498)|
| 2:38:23| the creek again in order to access that portion of the property. So let's say it's less likely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9503)|
| 2:38:29| It's not impossible that it would be used, but it's less likely. Okay. And another question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9509)|
| 2:38:35| section 5.13.02.d talks about usable open space and recreation. And if you have more than 20| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9515)|
| 2:38:44| acres or more, it's supposed to be 15% of the gross area. So can you point out to me how that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9524)|
| 2:38:52| criteria is met? That's the reference in the PR district for recreation. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9532)|
| 2:39:02| Is that what you're referring to? Oh, yeah. Five points. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9542)|
| 2:39:08| And that's the... I just wrote down the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9548)|
| 2:39:14| Yeah, if it's a portion of the PR district, that's where we have the conflict right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9554)|
| 2:39:18| where it talks about its recreational uses are a permitted use. And it describes what recreational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9558)|
| 2:39:26| uses are. And then the second part of that section, it talks about the amount of open space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9566)|
| 2:39:33| that's required. And it's kind of conflicting information where it says it's a permitted use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9573)|
| 2:39:37| within the zone as if it's like any other type of permitted use. But then it talks about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9577)|
| 2:39:43| open space standards. So we've had that issue in the past on how to approach that. It's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9583)|
| 2:39:54| really a standard like where the minimum setback standards are and those types of things where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9594)|
| 2:40:04| that center would typically be located in a zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9604)|
| 2:40:10| Well, we can talk about that. It seemed rather specific to me in that section. I bring it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9610)|
| 2:40:16| because there was a suggestion that there might be a walking trail started along the creek. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9616)|
| 2:40:22| I didn't know if we could look at that requirement as the median, some of the usable open space and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9622)|
| 2:40:27| recreation. I think Mr. Murphy brought that up. Did you look at that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9627)|
| 2:40:37| Oh, yeah, a walking trail could be put in that area, but it would just have to meet the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9637)|
| 2:40:44| standards for the creek buffer standards and those types of things. So it'd be a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9644)|
| 2:40:49| with county engineering too on how to approach that, how to design it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9649)|
| 2:40:56| Okay, two more questions. Another section 5.13.15.B.4 says that the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9656)|
| 2:41:07| shall review conformity and recognize principles of good civic design, land use planning and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9667)|
| 2:41:12| landscape architecture. And it's a, I have every esteem that I was just wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9672)|
| 2:41:21| where the good civic design, how the staff would respond to the good civic design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9681)|
| 2:41:29| principles of land use planning. We're supposed to actually review for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9689)|
| 2:41:36| And I don't know how to do that. I was wondering if you could give me some guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9696)|
| 2:41:41| I would say on a single family lot subdivision, it's a little hard to point to too many things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9701)|
| 2:41:51| I mean, we're really looking at like road layouts and lot layouts. We're not looking at it like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9711)|
| 2:41:58| large structure or anything that could be a focal point. I guess if there was anything of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9718)|
| 2:42:06| a real concern with the layout, I guess we could, it'd be something to address, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9726)|
| 2:42:11| this is such a tight site. The road layout is about what it can be without going a totally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9731)|
| 2:42:16| different direction with the neighborhood. Obviously, this isn't the only way you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9736)|
| 2:42:23| develop the property. It is one of the more common ways to develop a property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9743)|
| 2:42:29| To develop a property. It's a little hard to answer that in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9749)|
| 2:42:34| Commissioners, we need to get going on now with this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9754)|
| 2:42:38| I have one last quick question, Mr. Randolph, and I appreciate your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9758)|
| 2:42:42| I know I drive Murphy Road quite a bit, and I've noticed the volumes have increased substantially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9762)|
| 2:42:47| over time. And I was wondering if in the traffic report, we looked at more than just what is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9767)|
| 2:42:54| on right now, but we looked at the anticipated future volume given the pattern of increased use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9774)|
| 2:43:00| in the last few years. I don't know if somebody from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9780)|
| 2:43:06| county engineering is available to help with, they do evaluate future growth in their traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9786)|
| 2:43:14| impact letter. They submitted today, and that's typically part of a traffic impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9794)|
| 2:43:19| but they might be able to provide a little more detail on what they're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9799)|
| 2:43:26| Yeah, Commissioner Corbett, this is Jim Snow with Noss County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9806)|
| 2:43:30| As Mike's referenced and Josh's referenced, that report just came in literally during the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9810)|
| 2:43:36| so we haven't had a chance to really digest the details of it and really could speak intelligently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9816)|
| 2:43:40| on it just yet. Okay, so maybe we should look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9820)|
| 2:43:46| postponement a little bit so that we can understand what is coming before us for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9826)|
| 2:43:51| Thank you very much. Thank you, Commissioner. We've got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9831)|
| 2:43:55| We need to move on now. Commissioner Roth is needing to leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9835)|
| 2:44:01| Real quick, Commissioner Scott Smith. Yeah, I just want to ask about what were the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9841)|
| 2:44:07| and the vote. We're basically talking about these variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9847)|
| 2:44:11| That's correct. I don't have any issue that I'm aware of where the county has any issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9851)|
| 2:44:17| with any of these variances, so I'd like to ask that we go ahead and vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9857)|
| 2:44:25| Yes, Commissioner Smith, the county's comfortable with the variances represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9865)|

| 2:44:48| I feel like this, Commissioner Korblick has drawn out some other reasons why a postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9888)|
| 2:44:56| may be more appropriate in this circumstance. As well, this is the time we were supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9896)|
| 2:45:02| ask some of these questions, and this particular development, unlike some others, seems to offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9902)|
| 2:45:11| opportunities because of its positioning that we as a commission can help facilitate thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9911)|
| 2:45:18| those. Where it may not be the first go-to for the developer or the community, it seems like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9918)|
| 2:45:26| the developer has spoken and is very open to doing things, and the community has suggested some very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9926)|
| 2:45:33| positive ideas. So I hope that we can, after this motion has been voted on, we have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=9933)|

| 2:52:30| I live adjacent to the subject property on the northern boundary and have for the past 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10350)|
| 2:52:37| A couple of issues I'd like to make everyone aware of. First of all, there's stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10357)|
| 2:52:41| runoff from the neighborhood to the north, which is the Bennington subdivision. It flows off of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10361)|
| 2:52:47| the cul-de-sac at Colchester Ridge Road into the central part of the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10367)|
| 2:52:55| Currently, the concept plan as presented has no indication of how that runoff would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10375)|
| 2:53:02| be handled to make its way to the retention pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10382)|
| 2:53:07| In my packet that I uploaded to the public comments, you can see really good photographs of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10387)|
| 2:53:12| this. If you've got that available, if not, I'll just keep moving on. On the fourth page of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10392)|
| 2:53:21| little attachment, you can see where the runoff enters exactly where it enters the subject| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10401)|
| 2:53:26| property. It's right behind lot number 11. And so I would ask that the applicant address the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10406)|
| 2:53:34| strainage issue during the design and permitting phase with engineering and public works so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10414)|
| 2:53:39| the upstream stormwater runoff makes its way to the retention pond. There you go. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10419)|
| 2:53:48| the amount of rainfall going down in between a couple of homes right where I live, entering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10428)|
| 2:53:53| the back of lot number 11. I think I've got one more big photo on the next page. It sort of gives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10433)|
| 2:54:01| you the large overview. The flooding at the very top of the photograph is where the retention pond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10441)|
| 2:54:09| would be located. And then in relation to this drainage problem, the applicant's request for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10449)|
| 2:54:18| reduction of the peripheral setback from 35 feet to 25 feet at lots 9, 10, and 11 should be denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10458)|
| 2:54:26| as recommended by the staff. This is not in harmony with the surrounding developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10466)|
| 2:54:32| adjacent developments, Bennington to the north and Rofield to the west both have 35-foot setback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10472)|
| 2:54:39| requirements and we all need to follow the same zoning standards. Plus I think this additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10479)|
| 2:54:44| 10 feet of setback will be useful in addressing the upstream drainage problem. And then just a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10484)|
| 2:54:52| couple of other quick points that the community has raised and asked me to mention. We would ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10492)|
| 2:54:58| that the applicant change the name from Bluegrass Subdivision to something more specific. You pick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10498)|
| 2:55:06| Bluegrass Valley, Bluegrass Glen, Ridge, Vale, whatever because we who live in this area often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10506)|
| 2:55:12| just say we live in Bluegrass and so it would be like saying we live in Farragut Subdivision and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10512)|
| 2:55:17| that wouldn't really make a lot of sense. As a forester and an environmental consultant, I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10517)|
| 2:55:24| convinced that the applicant's reforestation plan will be successful without an associated irrigation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10524)|

| 2:55:47| approach around the retention pond but I don't really think it would be appropriate along the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10547)|
| 2:55:53| northern boundary and the western boundary. I would ask the applicant to consider following| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10553)|
| 2:56:00| the landscape screening design guidelines for a type A or a type C screen along the adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10560)|

| 2:56:25| parental responsibility zone for Bluegrass Elementary School and it's inside the reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10585)|
| 2:56:31| speed zone for school drop-off and pickup. So visibility is kind of compromised in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10591)|
| 2:56:39| We've had two fatalities. We've had several accidents through the years. So I would just ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10599)|
| 2:56:44| that the applicant and Knox County Engineering and Public Works look at this situation very carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10604)|
| 2:56:52| when they go through the final design phase. And that's all I've got. I appreciate your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10612)|
| 2:56:59| consideration on these matters. Thank you, Mr. Sisco. Mr. Hickey, your name and address please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10619)|
| 2:57:07| Ryan Hickey, 1914 Pinnacle Point Way, Knoxville, Tennessee 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10627)|
| 2:57:13| Thank you. First, I'll make a few comments concerning what Mr. Sisco's had to say here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10633)|
| 2:57:23| I'd like to point out that the reforestation plan that we have shown here was developed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10643)|
| 2:57:33| Billy Fulgham with Fulgham and McIndoe in cooperation with the University of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10653)|
| 2:57:38| in the forestry department, as well as several other experts in the field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10658)|
| 2:57:44| And we feel like the reforestation on these slopes goes beyond what's typically been done in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10664)|
| 2:57:53| subdivisions. And we feel like that over time it'll be an asset to this subdivision and to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10673)|
| 2:58:02| the community and it'll also provide some buffering. Now I'll switch over to the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10682)|
| 2:58:12| distance issue. We had a traffic engineer out there at the site this morning and they did verify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10692)|
| 2:58:17| there is adequate site distance in excess of 300 feet in each direction. And during the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10697)|
| 2:58:24| phase and the build phase, he will confirm that with Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10704)|
| 2:58:32| Now I want to speak about the peripheral setbacks. We've further evaluated the peripheral setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10712)|
| 2:58:39| and the only lot that we would like to ask on the northern boundary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10719)|
| 2:58:47| after we evaluated some home site plans on those lots, lots 9 and 10 can adequately work for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10727)|
| 2:58:55| with a 35-foot peripheral setback. Lot 11 does get tight with a 35-foot peripheral setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10735)|
| 2:59:07| Essentially, lot 11, you know, you would, it's not really developable right now without the 25-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10747)|
| 2:59:15| peripheral setback reduction. So we would like to ask that that lot be approved with a 25-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10755)|
| 2:59:23| setback reduction, knowing that lots 9 and 10 could go to 35-foot, along with lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10763)|
| 2:59:31| the two lots on the southern boundary, lots 34 and 35,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10771)|
| 2:59:36| we're also agreeable to a 35-foot setback right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10776)|
| 2:59:40| Do you guys have any other questions for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10780)|
| 2:59:46| Thank you, Mr. Hickey. Chair recognizes Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10786)|
| 2:59:52| Thank you, Commissioner Phelps. I have a question for the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10792)|
| 2:59:57| about the reforestation plan. And really, it's about before reforesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10797)|
| 3:00:02| but the security of the mature trees. Can you speak to that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10802)|
| 3:00:06| The what of the mature trees? I didn't, I couldn't hear you very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10806)|
| 3:00:09| I said secural, but essentially saving, you know, kind of earmarking here's some special mature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10809)|
| 3:00:13| trees that we want to make sure we don't lose. So this site, as you can see, the western portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10813)|
| 3:00:21| of the site does get graded to a three-to-one slope. So right in that area, it would be difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10821)|
| 3:00:30| to save the trees. And if you get relatively close to those trees during grading, they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10830)|
| 3:00:37| most relatively die within a year or two. So that's why we've proposed to reforest that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10837)|
| 3:00:46| So there is no, there's no plan for trying to save any of the mature trees. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10846)|
| 3:00:54| I mean, you know, along the boundary, we'll attempt while we're out there doing the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10854)|
| 3:00:58| to save what trees we can. It doesn't do us any benefit to tear trees down that rather they cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10858)|
| 3:01:04| us money to do that. There's no benefit to do that, but at the same point in time, we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10864)|
| 3:01:09| want a tree to die behind a home and then you have to come in and remove it later. That's happened to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10869)|
| 3:01:13| us often. My only other question is about, this is I guess more to either the staff or the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10873)|
| 3:01:21| the renaming of the subdivision. Is there any reason that that can't be done or what's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10881)|
| 3:01:26| process for doing that? No, no. And in Bluegrass subdivision, that's not the name that we intend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10886)|
| 3:01:32| when we record the final plat to have. That was just what the engineer filed here, just use the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10892)|
| 3:01:36| Bluegrass as Bluegrass Road, but it will be renamed when we do the final plat. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10896)|
| 3:01:43| Thank you, Commissioner. Chair recognizes Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10903)|
| 3:01:47| Yeah, I'd like to, I'd like to make a motion to approve the concept plan subject to seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10907)|
| 3:01:52| conditions. Is there a second? We have a motion by Commissioner Scott Smith, second by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10912)|
| 3:02:01| Graf. Approve the concept plan subject to the seven conditions. Ms. Edmonds, would you call the roll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10921)|
| 3:02:07| please? Oh, hang on, hang on. Hang on. Yeah, she did. I'm sorry. Ms. Kovalec?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10927)|
| 3:02:15| No, I just wanted to ask Commissioner Smith if he had an opinion regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10935)|
| 3:02:20| the peripheral setback for lot 11. Do I have an opinion on the plan? I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10940)|
| 3:02:29| Wouldn't that be under the development plan? I thought it would be. It's mentioned in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10949)|
| 3:02:34| Yeah. This is just the concept plan, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10954)|
| 3:02:38| Go ahead, Ms. Edmonds. Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10958)|
| 3:02:47| Commissioner Eddie Smith? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10967)|
| 3:02:52| Commissioner Eason? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10972)|
| 3:02:55| Commissioner Buston? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10975)|
| 3:02:59| Commissioner Dent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10979)|
| 3:02:59| Can everyone hear me okay? I must be having major technical difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10979)|
| 3:03:11| We can hear you, Jacqueline. Okay, I said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10991)|
| 3:03:14| Okay. Commissioner Adams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10994)|
| 3:03:19| Yes. Commissioner Browning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=10999)|
| 3:03:22| Yes. Commissioner Phillips?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11002)|
| 3:03:25| Yes. Commissioner Graf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11005)|
| 3:03:28| Yes. Commissioner Korbelik?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11008)|
| 3:03:32| Yes. Commissioner Scott Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11012)|
| 3:03:36| Yes. Commissioner Boyer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11016)|
| 3:03:39| Yes. Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11019)|
| 3:03:41| Yes. There are 12 ayes and zero nays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11021)|
| 3:03:45| Motion carries unanimously. Is there a motion on the development plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11025)|
| 3:03:52| Eddie Smith, I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11032)|
| 3:03:54| Okay. I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11034)|
| 3:03:57| And do we want to discuss this peripheral, Sandra had brought up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11037)|
| 3:04:04| How's the time? Yeah, I mean, there are the guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11044)|
| 3:04:08| I think that when you're in PR, you can request a 35-foot peripheral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11048)|
| 3:04:12| As I understand, if you adjoin other planned residential, then it would be 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11052)|
| 3:04:19| Could somebody in staff just kind of give us a baseline on how that flows?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11059)|
| 3:04:23| Because I've had that on subdivisions I've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11063)|
| 3:04:26| I've asked for 35 and had to deal with 25. Or the other way around, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11066)|
| 3:04:31| Go ahead, staff. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11071)|
| 3:04:34| So there are situations where planning commission can reduce that 35-foot peripheral to the lowest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11074)|
| 3:04:43| it can go is down to 15-foot when you're adjacent to basically other residential zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11083)|
| 3:04:49| but you can't do it next to the non-residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11089)|
| 3:04:54| So, in this case, they can request it and the planning commission can approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11094)|
| 3:04:58| the 25-foot peripheral. It's a case-by-case scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11098)|
| 3:05:05| whether staff will support the reduction or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11105)|
| 3:05:09| I think we're trying to reduce the amount of peripheral setback reductions as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11109)|
| 3:05:16| And so that's the reason why staff was recommending approval of the reduction on 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11116)|
| 3:05:22| 2, and 3 because of the situation with the driveway to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11122)|
| 3:05:27| It already creates a buffer to the neighborhood to the east,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11127)|
| 3:05:31| and we were recommending denial of the rest of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11131)|
| 3:05:34| But I hope that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11134)|
| 3:05:37| Do you know what the straw flower, the subdivision that backs up to what their peripheral is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11137)|
| 3:05:43| I'm fairly certain it's 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11143)|
| 3:05:46| Okay. I mean, I could go either way on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11146)|
| 3:05:50| I don't really, I mean, I don't want to cause anybody a hardship, but at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11150)|
| 3:05:55| you know, it's not the end of the world, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11155)|
| 3:05:59| Well, I was just mentioning lot 11 because the applicant indicated an extenuating circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11159)|
| 3:06:05| Well, you can make a motion and agree to that, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11165)|
| 3:06:11| We've already got one motion on the floor, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11171)|
| 3:06:14| That would be Commissioner Petty Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11174)|
| 3:06:17| That needs to be amended if we're going to include lot 11 in terms of a peripheral setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11177)|
| 3:06:24| Did that get a second, Pat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11184)|
| 3:06:27| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11187)|
| 3:06:28| Did that get a second, that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11188)|
| 3:06:31| Was it seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11191)|
| 3:06:33| You know, I'll be honest with you, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11193)|
| 3:06:36| Yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11196)|
| 3:06:38| It was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11198)|
| 3:06:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11198)|
| 3:06:39| Commissioner Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11199)|
| 3:06:42| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11202)|
| 3:06:44| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11204)|
| 3:06:48| Amy, this...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11208)|
| 3:06:48| They were asking who seconded the motion, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11208)|
| 3:06:51| Oh, oh, it wasn't me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11211)|
| 3:06:53| I had Commissioner Scott Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11213)|
| 3:06:54| It's a second motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11214)|
| 3:06:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11216)|
| 3:06:56| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11216)|
| 3:06:57| I had that wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11217)|
| 3:06:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11218)|
| 3:06:58| So this is Eddie Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-210311?start=11218)|
