| 0:07:13| or it just lets you guys know who should be using it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| It's pre-loaded with an amount that they could have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=435)|

| 0:07:23| So I can't get beer out of it without a wristband?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| No, and when it's not in operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=446)|

| 0:15:00| I am counsel for Aramark Educational Services, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| I'm joined today by Steve Tamburello, the district manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| and Christina Bull, the catering director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=907)|
| 0:15:08| both of whom are based here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| Very happy to be here in front of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| on a non-controversial matter that hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=913)|
| 0:15:17| is just a standard matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| This is Aramark Educational Services, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| They are applying for a beer catering permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| So this is a little bit different than some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=926)|
| 0:15:28| of the other Aramark work that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| have been familiar with historically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| This is the catering arm of Aramark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| So say, for instance, if you attend an event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| you're an alumni of the law school, as I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| and there's an event that's catered at the law school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=940)|
| 0:15:42| there's an Aramark Educational Services catering component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| Because of a change in the law toward the end of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=945)|
| 0:15:48| an entity like Aramark Educational Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| now, in addition to what they've had previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=950)|
| 0:15:53| also had to get a beer catering permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| So that is the effort that we are here to do today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=958)|

| 0:18:05| ahead of us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| So we've got a request to extend 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1088)|
| 0:18:11| I'll make a motion to extend for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| Do we have any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1096)|
| 0:18:18| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1102)|
| 0:18:22| Good luck getting everything done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1105)|
| 0:18:25| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| Next up is Diddy Market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1106)|
| 0:18:32| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1112)|
| 0:18:32| My name is Love Patel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1112)|
| 0:18:34| And I'm coming for 3700 Willow Springs Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| How's it going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1121)|
| 0:18:41| Now, we got our fire inspection approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| And tomorrow, we have a health inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| And the day after, we have our final building inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| That's progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| How long do you think you'll be open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1139)|
| 0:19:01| About two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1141)|
| 0:19:03| So you want to say 60 or 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| I'll leave that up to my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1150)|
| 0:19:10| So I just want to, so what inspections do you have left to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1150)|
| 0:19:15| Health and final building inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Is that your records as well, just those two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1160)|
| 0:19:23| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1163)|
| 0:19:24| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| So this is an unusual situation, because we've never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| given this many extensions to one before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1169)|
| 0:19:33| And I was across the street from the property recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| And it didn't appear any work was going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| But you guys, you have construction going on to be inspected?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| So all the construction is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1184)|
| 0:19:46| So we just need it to be expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1189)|
| 0:19:49| So was there any new construction done, or it was existing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1189)|
| 0:19:54| Existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| But you turned in plans to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| And they were approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1201)|
| 0:20:01| I think their fire inspection was just completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1201)|
| 0:20:03| Is that correct, Mr. Byrd?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1203)|
| 0:20:04| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1204)|
| 0:20:05| Yeah, that was today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1205)|
| 0:20:06| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| Fire was completed today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| I'm going to make a motion to extend 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1210)|
| 0:20:16| since you're just needing two more weeks to get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| But that's the last extension I'll feel comfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1220)|
| 0:20:25| We're a long ways out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| So a motion to extend 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| All right, we've got a motion and a second on a 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| Yeah, I just want to say this has been prolonged a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| But the applicant is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| And he seems to have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| And he has made some progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1245)|
| 0:20:47| So I can support one more extension on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| Yes, I'll say, had we not gotten approval of fire inspection today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1251)|
| 0:20:56| it was going to be iffy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| But there's progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1258)|
| 0:21:00| So fingers crossed you can get through everything else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1260)|
| 0:21:06| and get your doors open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| All right, first, second, any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1269)|
| 0:21:13| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| All right, so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1279)|
| 0:21:21| Next is e-hotels and management LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| Anybody here from e-hotels and management?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| Mr. Byrd, have you heard from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1295)|
| 0:21:35| I spoke with Mr. Moncad a couple weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1295)|
| 0:21:39| And we talked about what was still needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| And then I expressed the great urgency to be here given last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| I think they were on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| The board was gracious in granting a 30-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1310)|
| 0:21:54| They seem to be on the same page with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| So I don't know what has happened since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| All right, we're nine months in on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| Do you want to wait and see if anyone shows up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| Yeah, we've got one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1328)|
| 0:22:09| We'll go through that and see if anybody shows up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1329)|
| 0:22:12| Last is Fast Hand Tavern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1332)|
| 0:22:19| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| It's Kevin Hibbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| It's 3800 Sutherland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| All right, how are things going with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| It's moving along slowly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1348)|
| 0:22:29| I'm trying to do as much work with myself as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| And I'm working full time on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| So I'm doing most of the work nights and weekends and mornings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| whenever I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| But we're making progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| I just ask if we can extend that maybe another 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| Are you hopeful 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| I'm optimistic on 90 days, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| I'll make a motion for a 90-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1377)|
| 0:23:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| All right, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1382)|
| 0:23:04| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1386)|
| 0:23:08| All right, good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| All right, back to eHotels and Management LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| I don't see anybody walking in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| Do my colleagues have a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1397)|
| 0:23:20| Well, it looks like we had approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1400)|
| 0:23:22| pending final documentation January of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1402)|
| 0:23:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1406)|
| 0:23:26| And we've had extensions in May and June and August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1406)|
| 0:23:36| Mr. Byrd, I guess you had actually spoken with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1416)|
| 0:23:39| and they understood that they needed to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1419)|
| 0:23:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| I was pretty explicit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| I never represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| I speak for the board, but I will often advise people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| what I have seen the board do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| And I said I did not feel confident that there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| would be an extension if there wasn't someone here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| to speak to the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| How many times have they not shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1439)|
| 0:24:01| to one of these appearances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| Do you recall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| October, or I'm sorry, August, last month, they didn't attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| And I think there was one before that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| but I may be misremembering that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| I'm going to call on Mr. Frost, if that's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| I was only what Mr. Roberto just asked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| about how many times a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1464)|
| 0:24:26| So if they don't extend, if the billboard doesn't extend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1466)|
| 0:24:31| the matter dies, and you can come back and re-apply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| and re-study, or you can extend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1477)|
| 0:24:40| I'm troubled by the discussion with Mr. Byrd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1480)|
| 0:24:45| and then not showing up and not being here one other time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1485)|
| 0:24:52| If I recall, I think the last meeting we even said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| we'll do it for 30 days, and we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| going to be very comfortable doing it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| I mean, I'd like to extend it for 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| but I also think that at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| that they haven't shown up, I think we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1506)|
| 0:25:10| I mean, Mr. Frost, if we just don't take action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| is that all we have to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1515)|
| 0:25:17| If you don't take action, they'll simply need to re-apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| Re-apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| Hopefully, they'll have their things on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| I think I'm just not comfortable making a motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| but if somebody else does, that's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1529)|
| 0:25:35| I have a question, Mr. Byrd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| What do they lack?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| They lack the articles of organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| a copy of that for their LLC, and then inspections, fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1542)|
| 0:25:46| and health approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| I'll defer to Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| I'm inclined to agree with Vice Mayor Roberto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| as we see that this request was first submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| September of 2022, and I think there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| been a lot of leniency and grace that's been granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| And based on you having a very open and honest conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| with them to not have a representative here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| or to have reached out to the district representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| I think really shows a lack of not taking this very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| And so regardless of the motion, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| would not be inclined to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| An additional extension, I think that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1592)|
| 0:26:34| would be setting a very bad, poor precedent moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1594)|
| 0:26:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1604)|
| 0:26:45| So as I hear, my colleagues have recommended no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1605)|
| 0:26:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Well, seeing no further business, then we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1613)|
| 0:27:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beer-brd-r-293-230919?start=1622)|
