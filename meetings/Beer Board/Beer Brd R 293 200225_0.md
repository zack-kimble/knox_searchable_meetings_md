| 0:15:30| We have taken over from the prior owners of Vienna Coffee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| which is Vienna Coffee out of Maryville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=934)|
| 0:15:36| and just continuing with the name, menu,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| and we would like to continue serving beer as they had been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=944)|

| 0:15:47| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| We just need the surrender of your current permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| I see you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=951)|

| 0:15:57| I have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=958)|
| 0:15:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=960)|
| 0:16:01| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| Next up is Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=967)|
| 0:16:15| Kim Bumpus, 301 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| Kim, do you want to tell us a little bit about what we're talking about today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=978)|
| 0:16:22| Yeah, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| So we are going to be launching a new series on first Friday called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| Taps and Tunes in partnership with WDVX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| So our position is we will only be selling beer on the first Friday event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=990)|
| 0:16:36| and I will tell you as many questions as we've gotten,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| there is a huge revenue stream if we were to sell every day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| but that is not what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| So it's for first Friday only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1006)|

| 0:16:55| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1015)|
| 0:16:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1016)|
| 0:16:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Do we want to move on to the addendum first and then come back to Fanatic Brewery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| Let's do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Looking at the addendum, first up is Fat Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| Very appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1038)|
| 0:17:19| Sandy Gerard for Fat Tuesday at 417 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1039)|
| 0:17:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| Looks like we approved pending final documentation at the July 16th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| You asked for a 120-day extension, which was granted on October the 22nd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| and we're here today, so you want to give us a little update?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1055)|
| 0:17:39| We're asking for another 120-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| There's why, because there are some construction delays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1064)|
| 0:17:49| and we're working through those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| and we're hoping to be open late spring, early summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1071)|
| 0:17:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1076)|
| 0:17:57| Late spring, early summer of 2020?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1080)|
| 0:18:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| That's 120 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| Four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| Move postponement for 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1086)|
| 0:18:08| Is that the way you phrase this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| Yeah, we'll move to extend it 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Move to extend it 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| I have a motion to second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| Granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| The gathering spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1105)|
| 0:18:38| I'm representing Ms. Terry-Kate Hill, and we've got our finals and stuff today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1118)|
| 0:18:45| but we weren't able to get the health department over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1125)|
| 0:18:53| and that's the only thing that's left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1133)|
| 0:18:56| Can you tell us your name again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| Charles Holland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1138)|
| 0:18:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| He's supposed to be coming over on Thursday, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1143)|
| 0:19:05| He said he's going to try to get over on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1145)|
| 0:19:08| How much more time do you think you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1148)|
| 0:19:10| Just 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Do we want to consider a motion to postpone 60 days just in case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| Yeah, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| I'll make a motion to postpone 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1162)|
| 0:19:23| Extend, extend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| I'm going to change my vocabulary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1165)|
| 0:19:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| Motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1168)|
| 0:19:29| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1169)|
| 0:19:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1170)|
| 0:19:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1171)|
| 0:19:32| That's granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1172)|
| 0:19:33| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| Okay, going back to Fanatic Brewery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1175)|
| 0:19:42| Is anyone from Fanatic Brewery?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| Mr. Frost, since this is the second time we've called, we don't have anyone here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| What are our options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Well, from the paperwork I have, it shows the file is complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| Mr. Howard, do you have any applicable record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1202)|
| 0:20:09| No record, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| Well, I mean, yes, it's really good for somebody to be here, but in this circumstance, they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1211)|
| 0:20:20| done what they need to do to be granted the permit, so I think it would be within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| beer board's ability to grant the permit since they've done everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1224)|
| 0:20:31| So there'd be no change if we had somebody standing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| We'd get a report back that the file's complete, and then there's no applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| I mean, if they were there, I mean, Ms. Dyer, I mean, they would get it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1240)|
| 0:20:47| They would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1247)|
| 0:20:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| And if they don't come and pick it up, we approve it and no one picks it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1249)|
| 0:20:55| It's just nothing changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| It'll come back to you that they didn't pick it up on an addendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| Oh, it'll be on another agenda in the future and we'll know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| What's the date of the March meeting for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| March 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1269)|
| 0:21:11| 24, which is the Tuesday before their Saturday and Sunday event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1271)|
| 0:21:16| I'm making an assumption based on these dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| I mean, I guess I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1284)|
| 0:21:26| Councilperson Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1288)|
| 0:21:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Oh, was yours on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| I was calling on Councilperson Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| I had a question, but I'll second it so that we can discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| So my question is, is there a time frame in which if beer permits are not picked up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1297)|
| 0:21:45| they automatically expire?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| I just don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1308)|
| 0:21:49| Well, a beer permit has to be picked up within 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| And that's why when the people before who had to come back was because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| hadn't completed everything within 90 days and they have to ask for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| extension of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| I mean, you know, you all – I mean, I don't know the people involved with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| the marathon, but, I mean, I generally know the marathon, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| it's a well-run event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1330)|
| 0:22:14| Clearly something's come up or they would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| Yeah, that's not – that isn't my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| My concern was just once we approve one, does it ever cease to be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| because I'm new at this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| And the answer is we approve them, and if they're not picked up in 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| it goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Yeah, if you have a beer permit and, you know, you close up the business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| then eventually the police will catch up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| And a complaint will be filed in the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| But, you know, theoretically, you all could postpone the marathon's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1364)|
| 0:22:53| application till the next meeting and they still have time to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| Also, it's a temporary, so it would expire March the 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| Okay, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| I mean, mine was not – I'm sorry, I asked a question that really wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| germane to this specific one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| I just was trying to learn about beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1389)|
| 0:23:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1391)|
| 0:23:13| That is not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| All right, so I had a motion and a second, I believe, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| I did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| Yeah, I seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| So I had a motion and a second to go ahead and approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| All right, so moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| If you all wanted to, you could ask that whoever the applicant is come on down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1409)|
| 0:23:36| for the next March meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| So if there are any questions, you know, you can ask them at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| but I'm sure there's – they're in a car wreck or something has happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| Otherwise, I think they would – any person would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1428)|
| 0:23:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1430)|
| 0:23:51| All right, moving on to beer board resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| After our discussion at our last meeting and since council has now passed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1434)|

| 0:24:04| the application form for beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1444)|

| 0:24:14| downtown festival district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1454)|

| 0:24:20| last meeting that says beer board will not consider applications without completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrdr293200225?start=1460)|
