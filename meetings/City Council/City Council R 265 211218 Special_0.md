| 0:02:05| Seven present, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-special?start=125)|
| 0:02:06| Thank you, Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-special?start=126)|
| 0:02:08| So the next item and only item on our agenda is elections and confirmations for Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-special?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| Beer Board Chair, and KTA representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-special?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| So, councilmembers, Mr. Frost sent you out the process that you have been following for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-special?start=137)|
| 0:02:24| and I'm going to go over that and plan to follow that unless council chooses to adopt another process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-special?start=144)|
| 0:02:30| So that process, I'll just go over it really quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-special?start=150)|
| 0:02:33| I will announce the office for consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-special?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| and then Mr. Johnson will call the roll asking each member of council whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-special?start=156)|
| 0:02:40| or not he or she wants to be considered for that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-special?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| Once all nine or seven of the nine members who are here state whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-special?start=163)|
| 0:02:46| or not they wish to be considered for that particular office, the nomination is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-special?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| Then Mr. Johnson will ask each member of council to state the name of the person they desire to elect to that office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-special?start=170)|
| 0:02:56| and if one person receives five or more votes, that person is elected to that office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-special?start=176)|
| 0:03:00| If no one receives five votes, the person receiving no votes, if any, is eliminated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-special?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| and the vote is taken again in the same manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-special?start=185)|
| 0:03:08| Does anyone have any questions about that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-special?start=188)|
| 0:03:12| Okay. Then we'll move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-special?start=192)|
| 0:03:15| And Council Member Parker is now present, so let the record reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-special?start=195)|
| 0:03:21| Okay, so we'll start with the election of vice mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-special?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| Mr. Johnson, could you please conduct that process we just described?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-211218-special?start=205)|
