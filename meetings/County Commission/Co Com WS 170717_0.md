| 0:01:08| Ten members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=68)|
| 0:01:10| This is the 11th month of commission, but we're going to back up a month so that Commissioner Bob Thomas will be the first vice president of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=70)|
| 0:01:35| And Commissioner Bob Thomas will be the first vote casting person in the occurrence of a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=95)|
| 0:01:46| But with that notoriety also comes the opportunity to lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=106)|
| 0:01:52| So, Commissioner Thomas, I request that you lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=112)|
| 0:02:02| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=122)|
| 0:02:32| It's with a note of sadness that I recognize the passing of a parent of a member of some would say former commission, but once a commissioner, always a commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=152)|
| 0:02:59| Sam McKenzie's father, Sam McKenzie Senior, passed away on Thursday, July the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=179)|
| 0:03:08| The family will receive friends on Wednesday, July the 19th from 6 to 7 p.m. with the funeral service to follow at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=188)|
| 0:03:25| This will be taking place at Mount Olive Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=205)|
| 0:03:30| That's at 1601 Dandridge Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=210)|
| 0:03:35| And it goes without saying that our thoughts, our prayers, our condolences, our sympathies go to Sam McKenzie at the passing of his father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=215)|
| 0:03:49| For public forum this evening, Carrie Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=229)|
| 0:03:55| Carrie Witt would like to speak on the Knox County Schools Clothing Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=235)|
| 0:04:03| Miss Witt, could you give your address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| 10412 Cobb Lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=247)|
| 0:04:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| I just want to say thank you all so much for allowing me to speak tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| And just that you leave this community with servant hearts and it allows programs like our clothing center to exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=258)|
| 0:04:23| So thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| And thank you, Commissioner Daly and Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=265)|
| 0:04:27| I know that you all have very busy schedules and they were able to stop by to our open house on Friday and see a little bit about what the clothing center is firsthand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=267)|
| 0:04:35| So thank you so much for being able to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=275)|
| 0:04:38| The clothing center, for those that aren't aware, was started in 1936.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| And when it was first started, they actually made the clothing for our students in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=283)|
| 0:04:47| So we've come quite a long way since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=287)|
| 0:04:50| We live solely on donations from community members, our partners who help us by, you know, either raising funds to help us purchase clothes or, you know, having clothing drives themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=290)|
| 0:05:02| So that's how we are able to take care of the students in need in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=302)|
| 0:05:07| Some of our important partners, United Way, Prestige Cleaners, they help us throughout the year with funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=307)|
| 0:05:15| Prestige helps us by taking care of our clothing that comes in that needs to be laundered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=315)|
| 0:05:21| We do have laundry facilities there, but there are times that our lost and founds or donations exceed what we can do in a very quick capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=321)|
| 0:05:29| So they take our clothing out and they'll wash it, fold it, and bring it back to us, which helps us tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=329)|
| 0:05:35| We have two wonderful ladies that work there, Pat Johnson and Sharon Russell, who attend to our students and help make their lives a little bit easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=335)|
| 0:05:44| and help take a little bit of stress away from what they have to deal with each day as they come to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=344)|
| 0:05:52| Last school year, we helped 1,988 students in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| Of those, they come from all of our Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| Not a select few, not half, all of our Knox County schools are affected by the clothing center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| So it's all areas of the county that we're able to reach, which is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| We gave away over 65,000 items of clothing, which is about 10,000 more than what we've given away the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=370)|
| 0:06:18| And that's only able to happen just because of the amount of donations that we have come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| We try to provide the students with a week's worth of clothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=383)|
| 0:06:26| We give away two new pair of pants, three new shirts, five pair of socks, and five pair of underwear, and all those are brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=386)|
| 0:06:34| The rest of the week, we try to fill them with what we consider gently used clothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| which comes from donations from communities and organizations and individuals like yourself that have those things that we can use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=398)|
| 0:06:45| We take sizes 4T to 5X, so we have a large gamut of things that we stock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=405)|
| 0:06:52| And just thank you so much for the attention to this wonderful cause that we love so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=412)|
| 0:06:59| I do have a challenge. Commissioner Daly didn't come in when he was there Friday, and he joined our clothing center PTA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=419)|
| 0:07:05| which oversees the clothing center function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| It's a $10 join, and I'd like to challenge the rest of you to join our PTA this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=430)|
| 0:07:14| We would appreciate that. That helps us be able to operate throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| Seeing no other comments, thank you, ma'am, for your presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| Also at this time, I'd like to recognize that we have in our audience this evening the Honorable Mayor of Knox County, Mayor Tim Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=445)|
| 0:07:36| You wish to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| Also Farragut Alderman Louise Hovland is here with us again this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=459)|
| 0:07:48| I think those are the electeds that are with us this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=468)|
| 0:07:54| As we move further down the agenda, it is now time for amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=474)|
| 0:08:02| As in the work session, we normally, or I normally, try to do this as a two-step operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=482)|
| 0:08:09| First, we'll have all the ads, deferrals, or withdrawals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=489)|
| 0:08:16| For ads, since the meeting of the agenda committee, item 80 on page 12, that's resolution 605, has been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=496)|
| 0:08:31| That's the Health Department vaccination and yellow fever resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=511)|
| 0:08:38| Also, there has been an ad for a spread of record general sessions judges' employee handbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=518)|
| 0:08:50| I think that may be item 90 on page 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=530)|
| 0:08:58| Also, there has been an ad way back up at the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| Item 7, that's resolution 111 on page 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=544)|
| 0:09:09| That's the mayoral appointment to the Knox County Historical Zoning Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=549)|
| 0:09:17| There have been a couple of withdrawals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=557)|
| 0:09:22| Item 83, resolution 901 on page 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=562)|
| 0:09:29| That was an issue of technology in the juvenile court clerk office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| It's been withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| Also, that was withdrawn by the sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=576)|
| 0:09:39| Also withdrawn by the sponsor, item 85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| That's an ordinance 101, page 13, dealing with noise of construction equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=585)|
| 0:09:57| Are there any other ads or withdrawals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=597)|
| 0:10:03| Now for deferrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| Mr. Chairman, I'm Tom Salter with 205 West Baxter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=607)|
| 0:10:10| We'd like to defer for one month number 56, resolution 410.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=610)|
| 0:10:17| That is to defer item 56, resolution 410.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| Defer to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=622)|

| 0:10:32| Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=634)|
| 0:10:35| I didn't catch if you said item 80 was to be added, the contract with Sanofi Pasture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=640)|

| 0:10:43| Thank you, Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| Are there other items to either add, defer, or withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=647)|
| 0:10:59| We can motion the agenda set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| Motion is properly before us that all the items that need to be added, withdrawn, or deferred be so handled and is properly seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=662)|
| 0:11:10| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=670)|

| 0:11:16| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| We're now into the establishment of the consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=678)|
| 0:11:28| I think we should have discussion of item 82.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=688)|
| 0:11:33| That's resolution 801 on page 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| That's the Sammy Hill School property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=697)|
| 0:11:42| So that one will not be on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=702)|
| 0:11:50| Also, we need to discuss item 86, which is ordinance 102, page 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=710)|
| 0:11:58| That's zoning of the paintball and associate activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=718)|

| 0:14:44| Yeah, NACO or whatever you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=884)|
| 0:14:58| Is there anything else that people need to discuss for this evening's agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=898)|
| 0:15:16| I need to look to the fellow members of the Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=916)|
| 0:15:25| We do not have anything from the Audit Committee yet talking about whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| we should have a difference in the length of term of the external auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| That's still a discussion item at the Audit Committee level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| We used to have Audit Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| The background is we had an Audit Committee and we had an external auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=945)|
| 0:15:51| The external auditor served for four years or some set term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=951)|
| 0:15:55| Then we rebid the external auditor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| The way it is currently configured is the external auditor can work for Knox County for four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| and at the end of four years be renewed for an additional four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| Then that's the end of the term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| To let people know, there is some discussion that the external auditor could possibly be a longer term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=970)|
| 0:16:20| than four years plus four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=980)|
| 0:16:23| But that would be a rather lengthy charter review and revision operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=983)|
| 0:16:33| That is currently taking place only in the Audit Committee and not up to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| And they're in their sixth year of their contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| Right, and the current external auditor is in the sixth year of the plus four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1002)|
| 0:16:52| Are there other items that need discussion this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| Did I hear a motion that the consent calendar is then set?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1022)|
| 0:17:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| Motion is properly forced to approve the consent calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1032)|
| 0:17:20| Madam Clerk, the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| Did I hear a motion to approve the minutes of the previous meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| Motion is properly before us to approve the minutes of the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1053)|
| 0:17:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1054)|
| 0:17:35| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1055)|
| 0:17:37| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| And then let me make one last announcement that's unrelated for tonight's activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1060)|
| 0:17:47| What I'm about to say affects zoning next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| And we have been, we collectively have been notified of a request to defer to the month of September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1072)|
| 0:18:02| a zoning item that's on the next to the last page, 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1082)|
| 0:18:12| If that's page 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| No, item 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| Item 102 on page 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1097)|
| 0:18:25| Madam Director of the Commission Office and our legal assistant, Jill of the Jungle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1105)|
| 0:18:32| Am I correct in so stating this is item 102?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1112)|
| 0:18:41| Is that the number one I17RZ?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1121)|
| 0:18:48| Will be deferred to the month of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1128)|
| 0:18:53| And as I announce it now, it becomes irrevocable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1133)|
| 0:19:00| That item will be off of this month's agenda for zoning and will not be considered until the month of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1140)|
| 0:19:10| If there be no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1150)|
| 0:19:17| No, defer to the month of September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| Not to the month, not for one month, but two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| Until the meeting in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1164)|
| 0:19:38| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1178)|
| 0:19:47| This item is listed on page seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| Item number 45 resolution 238.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| It's a proven in intergovernmental memorandum of understanding between the Knotts County Commission, the mayor of Knotts County and the Knotts County Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1192)|
| 0:20:01| Regarding the Board of Education's repayment of $11,962,133.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1201)|
| 0:20:08| To Knotts County for the remainder of its capital improvement project for energy management equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1208)|
| 0:20:22| Mr. Daly. Item number 45.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1228)|
| 0:20:31| Mr. Caldwell, then Mr. Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| I talked earlier this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| No, last week, I guess it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| Can you fill us in the public on what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1239)|
| 0:20:43| And I know it's before your time, but go ahead and explain it the best that you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| Back in 2012, we entered into a new phase of a train agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1249)|
| 0:20:56| At that time, which precedes Gary and myself, the commission approved the contract and the work was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1256)|
| 0:21:04| And on the county side, we never issued the bonds to pay for the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1264)|
| 0:21:10| And so what ended up happening as we got to the end of the fiscal year this past year, as we were doing our audit, we realized that the school construction fund was in the negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1270)|
| 0:21:21| And we did some research and found out why, that those bonds were never issued for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| And so we sat down with Gary and schools and tried to figure out a way to work to make that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1287)|
| 0:21:35| We could have went ahead and issued bonds to make that process work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1295)|
| 0:21:41| But instead, we have some money, some fund balance in our debt service fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1301)|
| 0:21:48| We sat down and agreed to a 10-year term, which fits well in the school's debt service plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1308)|
| 0:21:56| And we offered them this, since we have some fault in it, interest-free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| And so there would be no interest paid on the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| It was just let them pay it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| In years, it fits in their debt plan and gets that fund back to where it needs to be and makes everything whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1328)|
| 0:22:20| Okay, Mr. Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| Thanks, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| You talked this morning, and I guess one of my concerns was how the school was going to pay back this debt without it being added on to a budget next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1347)|
| 0:22:36| Would you explain to me how that would have happened, that taxpayers wouldn't be robbing Peter to pay Paul?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1356)|
| 0:22:43| Well, as Chris mentioned, when we started discussing this, one of the things that I did was I looked at the debt amortization schedule for the school district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1363)|
| 0:22:52| and tried to determine where this repayment plan would fit best in that amortization schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1372)|
| 0:22:59| And this is what I came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| We have two debt issues that will be coming off the schedule in the next couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1382)|
| 0:23:07| which will reduce the amount of debt service that the school district will have going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1387)|
| 0:23:13| And so that's where this comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1393)|
| 0:23:18| The addendum or attachment has the payment schedules that we all see, and then that can be online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1398)|
| 0:23:24| You and I had discussed about this is an energy program that was started by Terrain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| and in my former, where I retired from my job, I'll give a plug to Applied Industrial Technologies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| I dealt a lot with the energy savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| And you and I had discussed this morning how much energy savings have they shown us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1419)|
| 0:23:46| and you'll probably have to have this next week, but I would like to know an audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1426)|
| 0:23:51| if we're going to have an audit, to show because everyone that I did in my former dealings I had with other industrial-type companies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1431)|
| 0:24:01| we had to prove that there was a savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| And I'd like to know if that's in the contract, if they have not lived up to that savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1444)|
| 0:24:10| is there a penalty that they've got to pay us back anything for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| Again, this is long before my time with the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| but the Terrain project has been carried out in actually five phases, and it kicked off back in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1463)|
| 0:24:33| And so, as we discussed, one of the things that I have planned is for us to review this whole project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1473)|
| 0:24:43| to ensure that the district is being reimbursed where it's not saving money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| or to ensure that it is actually saving the kinds of utility dollars that were promised when the agreements were entered into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1488)|
| 0:24:57| This will take a while, because it's going back to, as I say, 2009, just to ensure that everything has been as it was promised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1497)|
| 0:25:07| I will say that the investment in the train aspects of this were over $68 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1507)|
| 0:25:16| and that's being amortized over a progressive 20-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| That's a pretty good chunk of change to be recovered from electrical charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1521)|
| 0:25:28| Yeah, like you and I discussed this morning, the cost savings comes in the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1528)|
| 0:25:33| I've seen that many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1533)|
| 0:25:35| I've been doing it for 38-and-a-half years, and the cost savings are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1535)|
| 0:25:39| I'm not doubting that there's not cost savings there, but it would be nice to have an audit to confirm that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1539)|
| 0:25:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| I have a question for Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| Mr. Caldwell, this fiscal year we're budgeted to spend $75 million on our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1557)|
| 0:26:05| Is this part of that $75 million, or is this $75 million plus this amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1565)|
| 0:26:12| This would be revenue coming in from the schools to debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1572)|
| 0:26:21| and so we did include that in our budget projection because we know what their debt service payment schedule is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| So that was included in the budget that we adopted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1587)|
| 0:26:31| Yeah, it is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| So it's revenue that's coming in, in this case, to debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| So what we do is we'll make a transfer of the total amount over to school construction, so it will reduce that fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1600)|
| 0:26:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| Seeing no further discussion, motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1619)|
| 0:27:00| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1620)|
| 0:27:01| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| Madam Clerk, 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| Item 46 is Resolution 301.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1628)|
| 0:27:11| It's approving Amendment No. 6 to the lease with Samuel J. Ferrell for space located at 1800 North Cherry Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1631)|
| 0:27:18| for the Knox County Sheriff's Office Community Alternatives to Prison Program, CAP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1638)|
| 0:27:23| which amendment extends the lease for a period of two years beginning July 1, 2017 and ending June 30, 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1643)|
| 0:27:31| with the monthly rental amount remaining at $4,245.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1651)|
| 0:27:37| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1661)|
| 0:27:42| I just wanted to connect the dots with our board on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| If you all recall, we had a grant from the state of Tennessee to provide substance abuse treatment services primarily to offenders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1665)|
| 0:27:54| who were not incarcerated, but they also required more additional supervision than those who were on probation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1674)|
| 0:28:02| That's what the Community Alternatives to Prison Program does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| This body, before I was sworn into this body, actually appointed me to the Board of Directors for CAP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1685)|
| 0:28:11| and I want to assure you that they're doing a very good job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| and that property that they're leasing, considering the size of the space that they have, that's a pretty good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1694)|
| 0:28:21| It's frankly kind of a rundown warehouse, so we're right behind the old Levi's factory off of Cherry Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| So motion to approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1707)|
| 0:28:29| It's a great program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| and as we've taken some stands on providing mental health services and substance abuse treatment in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1711)|
| 0:28:37| this is another good program that we should be behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| Seeing no further discussion, motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1730)|
| 0:28:52| Madam Clerk, 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| It's Resolution 411, Approving the Issuance of a Jackson Law Approval Letter to Indomed Incorporated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1734)|
| 0:29:01| allowing Indomed Incorporated to proceed with the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation's permit by rule approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1741)|
| 0:29:09| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Mr. Salter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| Who is a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1757)|
| 0:29:19| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1759)|
| 0:29:25| The Jackson Law letter caught my attention last week, and you sent me the email too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1765)|
| 0:29:29| but I still would like to hear, it's a medical waste facility out on Troy Circle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1769)|
| 0:29:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| And it's kind of caught my interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| I know we're all okay, but I still would like to learn a little bit about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1779)|
| 0:29:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| Let me explain briefly about the Jackson Law, what the county commission's role is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1783)|
| 0:29:50| The company Indomed has to receive a state permit, so they have to, TDEC actually regulates the regulated portion of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1790)|
| 0:30:00| and they also have to meet zoning, they have to meet building codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| The Jackson Law resolution allows the county commission to look at this project as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1804)|
| 0:30:10| and TDEC will not issue a permit unless the county commission is comfortable with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| So that's kind of the purpose of the Jackson Law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| It was a state resolution passed some years ago when a community got a landfill they didn't know was coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1819)|
| 0:30:26| So this allows local governments to look at these projects before they're opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1826)|
| 0:30:32| So do you have other questions as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| Yes, explain what the facility is going to be about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| I don't know who your gentleman beside you is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| Yes, this is Greer Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| And Greer, he's the owner of Indomed, and can I defer to him, is that fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| Yeah, this is a-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| I need your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| I'm sorry, Greer Butler, 8713 Amberley Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1855)|
| 0:31:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| What was your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| Briefly explain what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| It's not going to be an incinerator or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| It's a small-the machine itself is an autoclave with a grinder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| It's about the size of a large copier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1876)|
| 0:31:19| The mass of what it can take is about seven pounds in weight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| This is for the minimal amount of medical waste producer, mainly sharps containers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1884)|
| 0:31:32| some red bag material limited to syringes, tubing, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1892)|
| 0:31:42| Just for-I'm sure you're regulated by the state of Tennessee, or who you're regulated by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1902)|
| 0:31:48| That would be the next process in getting our permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1908)|
| 0:31:50| Yeah, and then they'll be there inspecting and making sure that everything's-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| I think I read where you put it in 55-gallon drums, sealed containers, then you ship it to-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| That would be the max potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| If we have overflow that we cannot process, we have a supplemental process in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1923)|
| 0:32:11| to contract with outside source to manage that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1944)|
| 0:32:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| Madam Clerk, 81.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| It's Resolution 701, approving an amendment to Knox County Contract Number 14-067| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1956)|
| 0:32:43| with B&D Lawn Care and Landscaping for mowing services for the Knox County Parks and Recreation Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1963)|
| 0:32:49| which amendment provides for the addition of Harold Park Road, Knox County Sports Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| and the U.S. Cellular Soccer Complex to the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| I hear a motion. Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| Mr. Doug, question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1984)|
| 0:33:09| You thought she was going to get away, didn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| This is for mowing for three parks that they had to pick up because I believe you had retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=1993)|
| 0:33:20| in your department that were doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2000)|
| 0:33:23| Is this going to be still a cost savings for the department after, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2003)|
| 0:33:30| some of the $350 every cutting could add up real quickly during the summertime?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| I don't know if it's weekly, month, or biweekly, or what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| Yeah, it obviously is still an expense, but as compared to full-time employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| certainly a cost savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| And I think the strategy we've had is to try to become a smaller yet higher skilled workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| and be able to contract out those services that make sense to contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| How many contract services do you have, B&D? Do you have any more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| We have three mowing contractors right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| We'll be re-bidding those after this season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2045)|
| 0:34:10| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2050)|
| 0:34:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2051)|
| 0:34:14| Doug, when we have these mowing contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| we only spend money during the mowing season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| unlike an employee that we have year-round that comes with benefits and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| These, I think, save a lot of money, and I'd imagine we're trying to go to more of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2065)|
| 0:34:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| Over the years, we went from just having, well, probably 10 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| no parks on contract mowed to where we're about 30 of the 42 parks on contract mowing now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| So what we've done is taken our crews and really focused on the parks that are real high use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2082)|
| 0:34:45| that we need to be sure we can respond quickly to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| and contract out the parks that are maybe on the perimeter of the county with a lot of drive time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| or some that aren't quite as critical in terms of public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| But we're still very much trying to guarantee the quality of the park system, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| We've changed some jobs positions to where we have more folks inspecting the parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2101)|
| 0:35:06| and a specialized small crew to go around just fixing and repairing things that the contractors don't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2106)|
| 0:35:15| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is properly before us to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2115)|
| 0:35:22| All in favor, say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| Motion carries. Madam Clerk, I think it's 82.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2127)|
| 0:35:30| It is, Resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2130)|
| 0:35:33| It's approving a Memorandum of Understanding with the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2133)|
| 0:35:36| to transfer a portion of the Sammy Hill School property located at 1725 Delaware Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2136)|
| 0:35:42| to the City of Knoxville for the development of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| into a multipurpose recreation, art, and education facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| for the children and youth of Lonsdale and the greater Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| Second. David Brace or Steve Diggs come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| I think we're all kind of or should be well aware of what we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| But I really just wanted to take a few minutes to talk about, you know, as a kid I grew up at Holston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2168)|
| 0:36:14| and the first memory I have of Emerald Youth is I think Steve and them started fixing dinner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| for the football team at Fulton on a Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| And it's really grown into what it is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| And so I really just wanted to say thank you for doing what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| I mean government can't, you know, the real key is education and getting kids out of poverty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2188)|
| 0:36:34| and government can't do it without organizations such as yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2194)|
| 0:36:37| And I appreciate the work you guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2197)|
| 0:36:42| Were you recognizing Mr. Brace to make comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| If they want to come up and speak or if anybody's got a question of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| David Brace, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| I'm the Senior Director for Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2212)|
| 0:36:54| We also outsource a lot of our mowing as well so we can talk about parks mowing in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| It is something that's important as we've grown in space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| I do want to thank Commission for reviewing this MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2222)|
| 0:37:08| Really appreciate Mr. Armstrong and the folks with the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| They've been great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| Mayor O'Hara was approached about an opportunity in Lonsdale with a longstanding partner in Emerald Youth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2233)|
| 0:37:20| They've been serving inner city youth for over 20 years, I think 25 years actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2240)|
| 0:37:25| And their board has a real desire to invest in communities like Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| They actually believe they'll bring around $8 to $9 million of investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| They needed the city to step in from a property perspective and from an infrastructure perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2254)|
| 0:37:40| The city, Mayor O'Hara has committed $1 million in city council to this current fiscal year budget to do that infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2260)|
| 0:37:47| And this MOU is the next step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| As you've read, it went to the school board for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| And then last commission meeting and then this commission meeting is the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2273)|
| 0:37:57| So if there's any questions, I think we're excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| There's been lots of discussion in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| That's been great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| Mayor O'Hara and Mr. Diggs held a public meeting, had great turnout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| There's lots of discussion about not only the project but some of the other challenges in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2287)|
| 0:38:13| We know this is a community that has real need for youth to have a place to go that's a positive environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2293)|
| 0:38:21| I think Mayor O'Hara is very excited about the fact that the Change Center in East Knoxville will serve that community as well as others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2301)|
| 0:38:28| There's actually going to be some new CAT routes going to the Change Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2308)|
| 0:38:31| And then this project would be directly in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2311)|
| 0:38:34| So two key areas in our community with new youth-serving activities, recreation, education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2314)|
| 0:38:40| So it's exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2320)|
| 0:38:41| So I'm here to answer questions and say thank you for the consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| I know Mr. Diggs may want to say a few words as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| Thank you, Mr. Brice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| This is Steve Diggs, 1050 Ledgerwood Avenue in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2330)|
| 0:38:55| And with Emerald Youth Foundation and Commissioner Andrews, we appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| Thank you for your kind words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| We say thank you to the whole commission for taking a look at this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| This truly is an initiative to really hopefully bring about transformation for children and young men and women in our Lonsdale neighborhood and that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2345)|
| 0:39:15| It's unlike any project I've been a part of before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| I'm really encouraged about the possibilities here and that long-term commitment that we're going to make in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2358)|
| 0:39:25| But we can't do it without this body, the city council, the city, and also the district attorney office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2365)|
| 0:39:33| And we've had the school superintendent in our schools involved with it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| So this truly has been a community-wide effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| And at this point now, we have met with over 350 people individually in Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| and we're continuing that listening tour to make sure that they're fully engaged in this process and can help bring about the success of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2387)|
| 0:39:55| So I'll also answer any questions, but we thank you for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2395)|
| 0:40:02| There are some things that we will have to consider this coming week in relation to the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2402)|
| 0:40:10| As I read our resolution, what's before us allows the law department, in particular Mr. Law Director, to back out of this contract up until the point that the contract is signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2410)|
| 0:40:33| In other words, county commission can approve this, but until such time as the two signatures are on the piece of paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2433)|
| 0:40:45| it is not a firm transfer until the two mayors have signed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2445)|
| 0:41:00| That's what's in our resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| Our agenda today is a rather lengthy piece of property paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2464)|
| 0:41:13| and you have to get down to page 1,582 to then read the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2473)|
| 0:41:23| Paragraph 4 of the MOU, and I'm only doing this to make sure everyone in the public audience understands what we're advancing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2483)|
| 0:41:34| Paragraph 4 states something of assurance of use and recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2494)|
| 0:41:39| The word and is not there. Assurance of use, recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2499)|
| 0:41:46| There is a 15-year schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| Provided this project is undertaken as it's presented, we are assured that the use will be as stated in the MOU for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2508)|
| 0:42:02| If that somehow changes, then prorated for those 15 years, the city will pay a percentage of the fair market value of the property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2522)|
| 0:42:21| That's, I'm reading from the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2541)|
| 0:42:28| My question is, after the 15 years, we, Knox County, nor the city of Knoxville, have an interest in the piece of property. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2548)|
| 0:42:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| Knox County would not have an interest in the property after 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2568)|
| 0:42:53| I just want to make sure we understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| And if never used for the approved use, the city will convey the property back to the county, and the county will reimburse for what expense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2576)|
| 0:43:21| Now, I'm asking the question, if the city conveys the property back to us because it's never used for the approved use, that's a quote out of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2601)|
| 0:43:35| do we reimburse the city for expenses that they have incurred at making the property ready?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2615)|
| 0:43:43| There's something in there, then, that I need to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2623)|
| 0:43:49| And then attachment two didn't make it into our pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2629)|
| 0:43:56| In other words, from page 1582 for the next ten pages, however many pages there are of this particular, for whatever we've got before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2636)|
| 0:44:20| So, based on a couple of three questions here, this will definitely be an item for discussion this coming Monday, whether it's approved today or whether it's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2660)|
| 0:44:37| you don't say no recommendation, is your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| I can change it to that, it doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| You're going to pull it off if I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| Because Bud's got to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| Excuse me, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| That's fine, no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2691)|
| 0:44:54| Now, back to you, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| Yeah, I'm kind of, the first statement that you made, I read the, going back and looking again at the MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2696)|
| 0:45:04| your comment that if we vote on it and the law director doesn't have to execute, what would trigger that refusal to execute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2704)|
| 0:45:15| Or are you just saying it doesn't happen until the two mayors sign it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| And I'm not referring to the MOU, I'm referring to the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| Read the resolution and that's the verbiage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| I saw that in the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| And so, you stated that, and so I'm just making sure that there's not something legal form that we're already uncomfortable with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2728)|
| 0:45:36| You're just saying it takes the two signatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| I want everyone out in TV land to know that we're progressing at all due speed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2738)|
| 0:45:45| I was just making sure that the Commission approved something in legal form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| and I didn't know the law director could pull that back, and I was just making sure of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| I do read that as the verbiage, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2751)|
| 0:45:55| I'll look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| We'll talk about it next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| Was there a question on this side over here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| Everyone said she had some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| Did you ask her questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2765)|
| 0:46:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| I did not know I asked Evelyn's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| This will be an item that we will be discussing at the next regular meeting of the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2771)|
| 0:46:18| The motion is seeing no further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| The motion that is properly before us is no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2782)|
| 0:46:29| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| Madam Clerk, is it 86?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| Yes, it's Ordinance O-17-7-102,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| which is amending the Knox County Code Appendix A, Zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| Article 2, Section 2.20, Specific Terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| Article 4, Section 4.97, Standards for the Approval of Indoor and Outdoor Paintball Ranges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2810)|
| 0:46:58| and Article 5, Section 5.22A, Agricultural Zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| regarding indoor facilities as a use on review in the Agricultural District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| This amends Ordinance O-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2826)|
| 0:47:13| On first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2833)|
| 0:47:17| A motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| This is an ordinance, so it will be discussed at our regular meeting next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2841)|
| 0:47:31| There are a couple of issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| One being we will have a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| and then if the discussion looks like it's headed towards a second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2857)|
| 0:47:43| Mr. Law Director, what would our guidance be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| If this body votes to pass this on the first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| you have to have a public hearing before the second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| and you have to give 15 days' notice for that public hearing to take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2876)|
| 0:48:05| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| I guess kind of part of the conversation we had last month on zonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2889)|
| 0:48:12| when we were discussing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2892)|
| 0:48:14| was this going to go to, I didn't see it in the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| does this go to use on review in the Ag Zone if we approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| or is it going to be every time it's in an Ag Zone they can do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2901)|
| 0:48:25| Every time it's in an Ag Zone they can put the property up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2905)|
| 0:48:28| Is it a use on review, or is it a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| because remember we were talking about that a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| and I want to make sure that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| because not every Ag Zone would be appropriate for that, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2915)|
| 0:48:40| That would be something if we could get clarification on by Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| I would appreciate it from the law department or from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2923)|
| 0:48:54| Mr. Law Director, do you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| Well, in the resolution it's talking about regarding indoor facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| as a use on review in an agricultural district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| So I think it's part of use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| but I'll look into it in a little more detail for next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| Motion is properly before us, and this will be up for deliberation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| first reading at the regular meeting of commission next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2958)|
| 0:49:22| All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| Opposed, no. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| Madam Clerk, I think we're to 91.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| Quick question on 89. Do we have any line item transfers this month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2970)|
| 0:49:37| Mr. Caldwell, do we have any line item transfers this month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2980)|
| 0:49:47| Item 91 is a discussion item regarding tourism and sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2987)|
| 0:49:56| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2996)|
| 0:49:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| I've spent some time doing some research and looking into ways we can grow our tourism industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3000)|
| 0:50:08| and I've asked Chad from the Sports Commission to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3008)|
| 0:50:13| He's also with Visit Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3013)|
| 0:50:16| Bob and I have had several meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| We've met with Carson Daly, and we would like to explore this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3017)|
| 0:50:23| and we wanted you to give us some advice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3023)|
| 0:50:25| and tell us if you see any potential in this type of industry flourishing here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3025)|
| 0:50:33| Sir, could I have your name and address for the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| Yes, it's Chad Culver, 417 East Foxton Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3036)|
| 0:50:43| Youth tourism is definitely growing in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| Most people nowadays, when they're starting to skip vacations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| they're still using that time and that travel to take their kids to tournaments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3050)|
| 0:50:54| In 2010, youth sports spending across the country was $7.2 billion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3054)|
| 0:50:59| and in 2016 it was up to $10.74 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| In Knoxville, Knox County alone, VK booked 31 events in the fiscal year ending in 2016 for $17.8 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3063)|
| 0:51:11| and then after launching the Sports Commission this past fiscal year, we booked 55 events for $42.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3071)|
| 0:51:17| So there's definitely a lot of growth there and a lot of potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| One of the things that we have been doing is trying to make sure we had the stuff we needed to recruit the teams here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3081)|
| 0:51:27| One of the things we did this past year was buy the 10 basketball courts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3087)|
| 0:51:33| which equal 14 volleyball courts that we put in the convention center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| We were able to do six tournaments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| I think we brought in about 309 teams to Knoxville for those six tournaments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| so it's just about getting what is needed in the community to attract the teams and attract the groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3101)|
| 0:51:52| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3112)|
| 0:51:53| Yeah, I want to, Chad's been a little bit modest there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| Chad has done a bang-up job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3118)|
| 0:52:00| He came on VK about 18 months ago, maybe 14 months ago, from Kingsport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3120)|
| 0:52:06| and spent a lot of time on the road between Knoxville and Kingsport until his house sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3126)|
| 0:52:11| But he has done a phenomenal job, AAU, travel volleyball, numerous other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3131)|
| 0:52:18| and there's a lot of USA Cycling, which was a very successful event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3138)|
| 0:52:23| And so he has done a tremendous job in promoting sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3143)|
| 0:52:27| I think we're about to buy some more equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3147)|
| 0:52:30| If you've seen at the police department, there's four trailers parked there now full of basketball courts and basketball goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3150)|
| 0:52:38| I think we're going to buy some volleyball standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3158)|
| 0:52:40| I got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3160)|
| 0:52:41| Basketball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| We're buying basketball and we have volleyball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3162)|
| 0:52:45| He's done a phenomenal job starting us down that path,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3165)|
| 0:52:47| and so I'm lucky enough to sit on that board and get to watch the success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| but there's a hardworking team that's promoting Knoxville in several ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| and one of them is sports tourism, so I appreciate the work you guys do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3178)|
| 0:53:03| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| Just a quick question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| How much as we're growing our sports market, I know we have certain gaps or shoulder seasons to a certain extent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3188)|
| 0:53:14| where maybe we're not getting quite as many room nights as we might.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| We're dominated by football season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| But we've got a BMX track coming online, so we'll be able to sell that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| We've got potentially Airsoft maybe as a sport that we can sell for travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| Where are, as we're looking at maybe new sports to be able to set up facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3209)|
| 0:53:34| where do those tie in with maybe some of our gap seasons, our shoulder seasons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3214)|
| 0:53:40| I'm not saying low seasons because we don't have any low seasons anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| but where are our shoulder seasons that y'all may be trying to target with maybe some incremental sports marketing with the youth market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3222)|
| 0:53:50| Yeah, I think there's a lot of so many new sports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| I mean, for years it was baseball, basketball, and volleyball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| But there's so many new sports that people are utilizing the same field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| So I think you've just got to go out there and you've got to go to the conventions and pull them in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| Like with our new courts, when we bought them, we committed to basketball and volleyball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3243)|
| 0:54:07| But you have futsal and you have handball, and you've got so many other sports that can use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| So it's just finding that niche and finding the promoters and the national governing bodies to come in to Knoxville to do them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3251)|
| 0:54:22| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3264)|
| 0:54:25| I want to thank Chad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| Also, we're still working on an idea that we had for one of our facilities here in Knoxville that's owned by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3267)|
| 0:54:35| And we've run into a lot of logistical, well, not logistical, but ways of titling it to get the athletes in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3275)|
| 0:54:46| And he has given us some ideas, and we're still working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| I want to thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| And it's a sport that could bring in quite a few people in this by using one of our own facilities in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3291)|
| 0:54:58| So thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| Chad, could you speak to how these tournaments, these events will bring people in for a weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3304)|
| 0:55:10| what kind of regular schedule you could have, and how it also leads to spinoffs, people coming back when they do have time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3310)|
| 0:55:19| I think Knoxville, Knox County, the central location within the south, makes it a very regional, attractive place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3319)|
| 0:55:26| You throw in the amenities that we already have and the character and charm of our town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3326)|
| 0:55:32| I think it's an easy sell to get people to come here, and then once they come for a basketball tournament, a baseball tournament,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3332)|
| 0:55:39| cheerleading event, or a soccer game, I know as a parent of one of these kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| a lot of these times you get to these towns and you sleep in a bed and you eat in a restaurant and you go to the field all day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3344)|
| 0:55:51| But there's been several of them that I've been to that I'm like, okay, you pick up the little brochure in the hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3351)|
| 0:56:00| and you want to go back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3360)|
| 0:56:02| And we've done that on a couple of occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3362)|
| 0:56:03| We've gone back to places where we didn't have a tournament because, as you said, most of these people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3363)|
| 0:56:09| they don't take the big two-week vacations, the seven-day vacations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| They take Fridays off eight, nine times a year and are gone on weekends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3373)|
| 0:56:19| So all they usually have is a weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3379)|
| 0:56:21| Could you talk a little bit about how you think Knox County could fit into that market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| Well, a lot of the sports tournaments nowadays, like you said, they show up on Friday sometime and they leave Sunday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3386)|
| 0:56:32| And besides eating in the restaurants and sleeping in the hotels, they can't do a lot of sightseeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3392)|
| 0:56:37| So that's one thing where we're lucky here in Knoxville, Knox County, that when we get them to town, our city will sell itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3397)|
| 0:56:43| And they'll see stuff that they want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3403)|
| 0:56:45| They'll see attractions they want to come back for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| So, you know, as in with USA Cycling a couple weeks ago, we had a lot of people come in town that were very avid cycling fans saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3407)|
| 0:56:54| hey, we're coming back next year, we're going to come back and spend a week in Knoxville instead of three days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3414)|
| 0:56:58| because we want to spend more time, you know, around the city looking around and going to the shops and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| So once we get them here, we feel like the city sells itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3423)|
| 0:57:06| We feel good about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3426)|
| 0:57:07| And events like the U.S. Cycling, which I went to, loved that, looking forward to it next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| Those are great, and we need things like that, but those are not things you can do on a consistently weekly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3432)|
| 0:57:19| I am looking for us to find a way to fill that every weekend gap with 1,000, 2,000 people coming in from out of state and out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3439)|
| 0:57:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3448)|
| 0:57:29| Well, that leads to the youth tournaments, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3449)|
| 0:57:31| And if you do the fields right and you have multipurpose fields that you can use for lacrosse and softball and soccer and baseball,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3451)|
| 0:57:38| that utilizes you to be able to use more weekends than just one sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| And that's what I was saying earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| You've got to find the fields that fit, you know, multipurpose fields that you can use over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3463)|
| 0:57:50| Given the penetration and growth of this, I know there are several places within 100 miles, Gatlinburg is one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3470)|
| 0:57:58| that have already stepped forward and done this type of facilities build, either with public or public-private partnership or strictly private.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3478)|
| 0:58:07| Is there still room for us to get into this market?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3487)|
| 0:58:13| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3493)|
| 0:58:14| I think when you look at, I mean, people across the country are doing it every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| And when I grew up, I like to say when I grew up, there was two travel teams in my age in baseball in Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3497)|
| 0:58:23| and now there's probably 50 or 60 my age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3503)|
| 0:58:25| So there's still plenty of teams going around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| I think that it's just, if you've got a city people want to visit, like we have here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3508)|
| 0:58:33| and you've got the fields and you've got the facilities, people will come to the tournaments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| If they're good tournaments, they're run good, they'll be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| There was an article that I read, and it was referring to Rocky Top, and it said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| Rocky Top's sports world, a state-of-the-art indoor and outdoor sports campus surrounded by the Great Smoky Mountains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3527)|
| 0:58:54| is on pace to set a record for the number of events in just its third year of operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3534)|
| 0:59:01| That site, I don't know if any of you all have ever been to it, is a really nice complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3541)|
| 0:59:05| It was a partnership between Gatlinburg Pittman and Rocky Top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3545)|
| 0:59:09| They share some of the same fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3549)|
| 0:59:12| If you go up there, you'll find cars from North Carolina, Virginia, South Carolina, from literally everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3552)|
| 0:59:22| I just think this is something that we might want to do a feasibility study on to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| to assess the facilities that we have, to look at what we might need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3567)|
| 0:59:31| and how we might be able to partner with a private developer to move forward on something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3571)|
| 0:59:39| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3579)|
| 0:59:42| Commissioner Smith made comment to the bicycle racing that took place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3582)|
| 0:59:50| and Commissioner Thomas is getting ready to ask you to add a category next year that commission can field a team to compete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3590)|
| 1:00:00| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3600)|
| 1:00:03| It has to be a tricycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| We can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3605)|
| 1:00:06| We'd have to be on the bicycle top of the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3606)|
| 1:00:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3611)|
| 1:00:12| First of all, I'd like to, since Vice Chairman Smith first talked to several of us about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3612)|
| 1:00:21| I really commend him for bringing this up because the more I've been involved, the more we've looked at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3621)|
| 1:00:28| it's really, I almost think, and Chad, you can correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3628)|
| 1:00:33| we are positioned in the perfect location with the interstate systems coming together, 540, 75, we've always heard that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3633)|
| 1:00:42| Now, I think even though the success, what you're talking about Rocky Top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| sometimes I think some of those areas get so crowded with all the other things they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| that it sometimes makes it difficult for people to logistically get around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3651)|
| 1:00:55| So I really would hope that this commission would get behind a study to see if it is feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3655)|
| 1:01:05| and then possibly to move forward to see if there are private individuals that would like to get involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3665)|
| 1:01:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| Seeing no further discussion, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| Next item of discussion is item number 92, reorganization in September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3679)|
| 1:01:25| The date is September the 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| Is that an agreeable date to everyone, September the 11th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| Do we know what time they'll be doing the 9-11 remembrance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3693)|
| 1:01:38| It's the time of the first hour, which is 9.50 and then 10.20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3698)|
| 1:01:45| It'll be in that hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| I would do it after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| Time to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| The date, September the 11th, is an okay date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3713)|
| 1:02:06| You're going to be the chairman of all the bad committees then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| Are you unavailable the entire week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3730)|
| 1:02:14| Through the 13th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| We'll be back on the 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| Did we rule out the 8th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| Friday the 8th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| I think Bob was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| Bob's out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| Bob's out the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| Who's out before the 8th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3750)|
| 1:02:35| Nobody's out before the 8th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3755)|
| 1:02:37| I think Bussler is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3757)|
| 1:02:39| I'm out that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| Where's Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3760)|
| 1:02:41| He's in the back of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3763)|
| 1:02:44| I think he's out, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| Why can't we do it the 18th before the work session?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| Everybody's here then because you planned on being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| Unless there's some reason that we shouldn't, I think it works fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| 3 o'clock on the 18th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| Or it would be 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| Well, no, is there no finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3787)|
| 1:03:10| 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3790)|
| 1:03:11| 4 o'clock on the 18th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3791)|
| 1:03:12| 4 o'clock on the 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| September the 18th at 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| Did that give us enough time to set all the committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| How many committees will have to be reset this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3797)|
| 1:03:19| Not very many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3799)|
| 1:03:20| It's in the middle of the cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| Reorganization is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3805)|
| 1:03:35| September the 18th at 4 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| The next discussion item is 93.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| It's a discussion item to close the loophole in the Knox County Zoning Ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3825)|
| 1:03:50| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| Over the years, there's been discussion regarding a residential zone regulation 5.41,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3834)|
| 1:04:03| and it's the OB, Office of Medical and Related Services zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3843)|
| 1:04:09| Basically, when you read the description,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3849)|
| 1:04:11| and what I'll do is I'd just like to give you the numbers of the zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| You read them, and maybe we could have a brief discussion next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3856)|
| 1:04:20| But if you'll look at 5.41.01,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3860)|
| 1:04:25| which is the general description of the Office of Medical and Related Services zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3865)|
| 1:04:31| and then you look at 5.41.02, Section A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3871)|
| 1:04:39| and both the community and the MPC staff has basically, over the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3879)|
| 1:04:46| said this has been a loophole because you have a residential zone classified in an office zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3886)|
| 1:04:53| as opposed to moving it to the RB, general residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3893)|
| 1:04:58| And what brought this to a head was there's a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3898)|
| 1:05:03| in Commissioner Anders' district off of Pellissippi Parkway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| where the applicant on the application, he's got 25 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3907)|
| 1:05:10| he says any use is permitted under the OB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| So when citizens call in to ask, well, what's going on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| they have no idea because you think 25 acres, that's going to be an office park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3918)|
| 1:05:23| when really it's most likely not going to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3923)|
| 1:05:27| So there's no reason to have a residential designation in an office or medical zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3927)|
| 1:05:35| and we just need to move that back over to the regular RB, general residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| So what we could basically do is eliminate Section A of 5.41.02,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3941)|
| 1:05:47| which we would have to do by ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| Do you know what the history is of adding that over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| Nobody seems to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3953)|
| 1:05:55| They just keep calling, well, you know, it's kind of one of those loopholes where we, I mean, who knows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| because these are so old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| Some of these go back to the 70s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3961)|
| 1:06:04| Would we have to go to each person that has a zone of OB and ask them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3964)|
| 1:06:09| do you want to be in the RB or the OB?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| Not if it's already been zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3972)|
| 1:06:13| This would be from anything going forward from the point of the ordinance being approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3973)|
| 1:06:18| by the Knox County Commission after the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| You can't reverse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3982)|
| 1:06:25| But I'd just like you guys to look at it, and the RB zone is 5.12 of the Knox County zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3985)|
| 1:06:32| Email us those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| Email them to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| Can I do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| I'll send them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4002)|
| 1:06:46| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| And we will revisit this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| Yeah, just so everybody understands what's going on, we'll read it, and I think that will make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| Plus, it will help not only the community, it will help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| Plus, it will also help the MPC staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4017)|
| 1:07:02| Seeing no further discussion, moving to the next discussion item, 94.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4022)|
| 1:07:08| Discussion item of the Employee Policy Handbook of the Commission Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4028)|
| 1:07:15| This is a discussion item that we've had the title for three or four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4035)|
| 1:07:23| Where we are now is that I have three, I believe I had asked three people to look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4043)|
| 1:07:31| I was a lucky winner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| Yeah, Commissioner Nystrom was a lucky winner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| I think we got all three right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| Right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| All three together on one side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4059)|
| 1:07:44| I would ask that the Commission Office get those three people a copy of our current employee policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4064)|
| 1:07:55| And I would also ask that some view be given to the internal auditor and how that fits into the employee policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4075)|
| 1:08:13| Good point, I get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| Commissioner Wright, with your discretion, I'll chair that committee, if it's okay with my friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4095)|
| 1:08:22| because it overlaps a little bit with our audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4102)|
| 1:08:25| And I'll work with my fellow commissioners to schedule a visit sometime in the next two months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4105)|
| 1:08:32| once we've gotten a copy of the manual, to have a sunshine meeting on that subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4112)|
| 1:08:38| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4118)|
| 1:08:41| If there be no objection, that is my appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4121)|
| 1:08:46| I saw that coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| Is there any further discussion related to the employee policy handbook?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4130)|
| 1:08:56| Seeing none, moving on, Madam Clerk, 95.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4136)|
| 1:09:00| Discussion item regarding discretionary funding of the Commission Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4140)|
| 1:09:06| This also is an issue that really, I think, started maybe back while the Tennessee General Assembly was in session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4146)|
| 1:09:16| and there may have been discussions of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| That also was a committee of three people, and I did not know whether or not those three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4160)|
| 1:09:29| Commissioner Schoonmaker, Commissioner Bussler, and Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4169)|
| 1:09:36| wanted to make any comment to how discretionary funding is currently taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4176)|
| 1:09:44| As we use sort of the at-rule thumb, is that we have a certain allocated amount each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4184)|
| 1:09:56| and it is normally directed towards schools or 501c3s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4196)|
| 1:10:07| Do you want me to say what I know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4207)|
| 1:10:09| I think you've been beat to the light by Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4209)|
| 1:10:13| The squeaky mic doesn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| The squeaky mic doesn't get it. It's the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4215)|
| 1:10:21| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4223)|
| 1:10:24| Now, when we first talked about this, you wanted us to see how other commissions did what they were doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4224)|
| 1:10:32| and it ranged from anywhere from west Tennessee all the way up, be calling and finding out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4232)|
| 1:10:38| Some have just one big fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| In fact, one county has $145,000 just put back each year for that fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| and they dip out of that fund for their discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4247)|
| 1:10:51| Other counties do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| They have all their fees and whatever clubs they're members of and things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4255)|
| 1:11:00| they're paid for in some counties, and normally if they need something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4260)|
| 1:11:06| they go back and they appropriate money for something in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4266)|
| 1:11:13| Most of the large commissions have a similar to what we have here is a fund that we ask to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4273)|
| 1:11:24| well, it's a certain amount that we use and that's about all we get unless something else comes up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4284)|
| 1:11:29| where they can come back and say we need an X number of dollars for something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| but we can appropriate that fund on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| But the big thing I get out of this, it's so wide-ranged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| We've got one of the best, I guess, the way we go here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| because we can decide in our districts what is additional, what we may need for our communities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4305)|
| 1:11:53| Theirs is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| It's whoever pulls the most money out the quickest is what I found in most counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4315)|
| 1:12:00| And the reason that we're involved in this endeavor is to do exactly, perform exactly as you have performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4320)|
| 1:12:06| You have researched it for us, and you come forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4326)|
| 1:12:11| Well, right now, I think we've got the best forum possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| Now then, we're going to go to Commissioner Squeakmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4335)|
| 1:12:18| Squeaky Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| Well, I think, by the way, Commissioner Gill, I believe, spoke to the commission office in Memphis or Shelby County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4340)|
| 1:12:28| I spoke to the folks in Hamilton County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4348)|
| 1:12:32| They probably have the most unique system where basically the commissioners get $12,500 per year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4352)|
| 1:12:40| that if it's not spent, it is not taken away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| They can add that to the existing council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| It does roll over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| Now, what they've done is basically taken their travel fund and put it into this, if you want to call it a discretionary fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4370)|
| 1:13:00| So, if they're going to a County Commissioners Association meeting, the hotels, the food, the rental car, all that would be taken out of that fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4380)|
| 1:13:12| At the same point, if they want to give $1,000 to help with a sidewalk project in front of some school, they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4392)|
| 1:13:20| They also have the option if one commissioner doesn't travel, doesn't spend any money, but yet the other commissioners do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4400)|
| 1:13:30| and at the end of the cycle they're short on money, he can then transfer money out of his or her account to those commissioners if they need money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4410)|
| 1:13:40| The other thing that they do is, for instance, if Commissioner Thomas is meeting with a constituent for lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4420)|
| 1:13:49| he could then take his lunch cost and deduct that from that $12,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4429)|
| 1:13:56| But he has to fill out a report once a month showing exactly what he's done with his money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4436)|
| 1:14:01| The same thing would hold true if Commissioner Bussler's printer broke down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4441)|
| 1:14:07| and he had to go to Staples and buy a new printer for his commission office, he could put the $88 for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4447)|
| 1:14:15| So there was a lot of diversity right there of what you can use the funds for, but in reviewing the documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4455)|
| 1:14:21| most of them were spending them for things in their district, or if you had a Legacy Parks luncheon where it cost $75 to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4461)|
| 1:14:32| they could use it for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| But again, every month they did detail it for the citizens to know exactly what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4474)|
| 1:14:41| And the system has worked well because obviously they're still doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| Do they have term limits there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4486)|
| 1:14:47| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4487)|
| 1:14:49| Because one guy has had second term trips to Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4489)|
| 1:14:58| With all that being said, I hope we're staying exactly the way we are and being accountable and doing a PO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4498)|
| 1:15:04| We've got the cleanest process probably in the state, and I think we ought to stick with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4504)|
| 1:15:12| Seeing no further discussion, Madam Clerk, moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4512)|
| 1:15:16| Discussion regarding the National Association of Counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| I bring this discussion item on the National Association of Counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4520)|
| 1:15:25| We receive a, I assume, monthly paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4525)|
| 1:15:32| As I look, they're having a convention, and I turn to Tennessee, and it says Knox County would have 18 votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4532)|
| 1:15:50| And I thought, 18 votes of what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| Going back to the beginning of the paper or that section, it says it's based on the number of members paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4553)|
| 1:16:08| Now, this may have been true years gone by, but we may need to revisit what we're paying the NACO and membership dues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4568)|
| 1:16:29| I think it's based on population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4589)|
| 1:16:35| They base it on population and benefits, not members of commission, but benefits to the public, such as the prescription programming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4595)|
| 1:16:43| So it's all based on population, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| Unless I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| We'll come back to this Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| We've got to get the WD-40 out again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4614)|
| 1:16:58| For what it's worth, Commissioner Daley and I had discussed going to that conference in July at the end of the month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4618)|
| 1:17:06| However, when we started looking at the actual sessions that were being held, a lot of the information, it was like, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4626)|
| 1:17:16| It didn't make any sense for Knox County to spend money to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| We looked through every single line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4642)|
| 1:17:25| It was like, what are we getting out of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4645)|
| 1:17:28| So that's why we opted not even to even consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| But I know previous commissioners have gone, both Jeff Owenby and Amy Broyles would go religiously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4652)|
| 1:17:41| But we couldn't find anything to seem like it was going to be of benefit to the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4661)|
| 1:17:49| We'll discuss this again next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4669)|
| 1:17:52| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| No, I was just going to add, I did go make a presentation at NACO last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| And I went through all their meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| And the one that really stood out, though, they did have a great discussion on mental illness in our jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4682)|
| 1:18:08| And that was one I sat in on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| And so there are some that would relate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4690)|
| 1:18:16| But it's worth talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| Seeing no further discussion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4699)|
| 1:18:25| I believe that's all the discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4705)|
| 1:18:32| Commissioner Kaye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| Can we get what Knox County pays for us to belong to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4714)|
| 1:18:39| We'll research that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| I'll have the Director of Commission Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4723)|
| 1:18:47| Now, if you get your really sharp pencil out, I'm going to go really quick now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4727)|
| 1:18:51| Get your sharp pencil out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| Are we taking a test?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| There's going to be a test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4736)|
| 1:18:57| This is not going to be multiple choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| This is going to be essay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4740)|
| 1:19:04| When I finish, you'll have to write an essay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4744)|
| 1:19:08| The Director of MPC, Director Green, will appear before our work session in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4748)|
| 1:19:23| That's August the 21st at 4 o'clock to speak of some of the things that we may have seen contentious in the last zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4763)|
| 1:19:37| It's sort of like today, talking about TIFs for a half hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4777)|
| 1:19:42| Director Green will be here to field questions and make some comment toward the MPC function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4782)|
| 1:19:54| Are we going to talk about sign colors?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4794)|
| 1:20:00| Where do they occur and all that sort of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| Director Green will be here at 4 p.m. on the 21st, August the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| As already mentioned today, Lifetime Products will have a ribbon cutting August the 10th at 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4809)|
| 1:20:21| Lifetime Products, August the 10th at 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4821)|
| 1:20:25| East Bridge Industrial Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| You may have seen earlier in the week the wall that heals is being brought to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4829)|
| 1:20:37| Mayor Burchett made the announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| It's a half-size replica of the wall of Vietnam Memorial in Washington, D.C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4840)|
| 1:20:51| We'll be here on Adair Drive October the 4th through the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4851)|
| 1:21:02| Next thing on my list is Ed and Bob, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| It's a good location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| We're going to South Knoxville this Wednesday from 5 to 7 to So No Tacos.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4870)|
| 1:21:17| This is brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4877)|
| 1:21:18| It's on Sevier Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4878)|
| 1:21:21| You will enjoy that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4881)|
| 1:21:22| If you'll come by and visit with us, you can join us from 5 to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| Whether you're an elected official, a resident of Knox County, or any other person who'd like to come by and have a few tacos with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4886)|
| 1:21:33| talk to us and talk about what may be concerning you in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| Thank you, Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| It's ironic that we have had Legacy Parks named just moments ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4900)|
| 1:21:47| Legacy Parks' annual luncheon is October the 13th at 1130.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4907)|
| 1:21:58| It will be at the Forks of the River Wildlife Management Area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4918)|
| 1:22:05| The reason I bring it up now is that in the past, some commissioners on an individual basis have given the $100 constituent fund into Legacy Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4925)|
| 1:22:21| The question that I have is commission going to do that times ten, or do you prefer to sit at other people's table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4941)|
| 1:22:31| I pay you way in, but do you want to sit as a table of commission, or do you want to sit with other people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4951)|
| 1:22:44| As a commission, I have to have ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| I think they designate a table for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| I don't think we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4970)|
| 1:22:51| I think it's part of our contract with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4971)|
| 1:22:55| We paid last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4975)|
| 1:22:56| Oh, you paid last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4976)|
| 1:22:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| I thought they, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4978)|
| 1:22:59| You're not paying for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4979)|
| 1:23:00| At the visit table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4980)|
| 1:23:03| Do we want to go as a group of commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4983)|
| 1:23:08| Mr. Silla, make sure that we make contact with Legacy Parks to say that we will like to be seated as a table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4988)|
| 1:23:19| and we will be making the appropriate $100 a head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=4999)|
| 1:23:30| We've been invited by the Metropolitan Planning Commission and the City of Knoxville City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5010)|
| 1:23:39| Can I address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| Let me read the invitation, and you can address it, because I'm getting ready to turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5021)|
| 1:23:48| I'm making the vanilla what I received in email that MPC is presenting a cell tower workshop to City Council on the 27th at 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5028)|
| 1:24:08| No, that's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5048)|
| 1:24:09| They're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5049)|
| 1:24:11| Okay, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5051)|
| 1:24:12| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5052)|
| 1:24:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| Well, I was floored when we got that email from the City of Knoxville recorder, Will Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5057)|
| 1:24:23| because when commissioners, I guess it was Gil and Carringer and Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5063)|
| 1:24:34| No, you weren't there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5074)|
| 1:24:35| Myself and Commissioner Daley had returned in October of last year from the Tennessee County Commissioners Association annual meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5075)|
| 1:24:44| I immediately went to the director of the Metropolitan Planning Commission, Gerald Green, and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5084)|
| 1:24:51| hey, we've got to get an ordinance in place for the cell towers, small cell towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5091)|
| 1:24:56| At the same time, I had visited with the Town of Farragut, and I'm glad to see that we do have an alderman here from the Town of Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5096)|
| 1:25:03| They were already in the process of establishing a cell tower ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5103)|
| 1:25:08| and I believe that theirs was in place in January of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5108)|
| 1:25:12| Was your final reading?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| So the MPC has been working on this since October of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5114)|
| 1:25:20| The Town of Farragut was able to get it through the help of consultants in basically 90 days, maybe 120 days, pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5120)|
| 1:25:30| So now what's happened is County Commission initiates a cell tower ordinance for Knox County residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5130)|
| 1:25:38| and now all of a sudden the City of Knoxville jumps in there with the MPC, and now it's, quote, their ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5138)|
| 1:25:46| So if you guys want to show up on the 27th at 5.30 in this room, you can hear, July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5146)|
| 1:25:53| you can hear what the City of Knoxville and, quote, Knox County's ordinance is going to be for small cell towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5153)|
| 1:26:00| Actually, as I understand it, that's a City Council meeting, and MPC is going to do the presentation to Council, and we can observe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5160)|
| 1:26:07| We can watch, yes, but yet it was our, we initiated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5167)|
| 1:26:11| We have no input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5171)|
| 1:26:15| So if you've got any friends on City Council, tell them what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5175)|
| 1:26:24| Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| Yes, on Tuesday, the 25th, it will be Ask the Commissioners with Amber Roundtree and myself at Love That Barbecue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5186)|
| 1:26:35| And if you don't want to go to the cell towers, come and visit me at the Knoxville Soup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5195)|
| 1:26:41| It's a great event. You'll have more fun, I can promise you, at the Knoxville Soup on the 27th, 6 o'clock at the South Knox Community Center on Merrill Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5201)|
| 1:26:50| Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| Well, thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5212)|
| 1:26:57| First of all, let me go back on the cell tower issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5217)|
| 1:27:01| There is an ordinance in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5221)|
| 1:27:03| You cannot stop, by federal law, any cell towers going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5223)|
| 1:27:08| All you can do is put it as a use on review, which is already set by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5228)|
| 1:27:13| I believe that's correct, Mr. Law Director. Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5233)|
| 1:27:16| Except the area has now changed to right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| That is the key issue, and if you talk to Dwight Vandervate, he will tell you what's getting ready to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5241)|
| 1:27:29| Any cell tower now can go in the public right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| and you cannot do anything about it unless you have an ordinance in place that strictly speaks to that language of the right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5254)|
| 1:27:43| But yes, we've had an ordinance for years, but it's not relevant now with the new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| Well, the ordinance says the height of it. Could that not pertain to anything at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5268)|
| 1:27:54| Not now under the right-of-way. It's a whole different ballgame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5274)|
| 1:27:58| All right. But anyway, let me tell you, people you just missed this past Saturday, our veterans get together at the downtown Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5278)|
| 1:28:06| We had over 100 people, veterans there, that represented every branch of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5286)|
| 1:28:14| It's a free breakfast for the veterans, and we do it at the Powell Community Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5294)|
| 1:28:21| We even had a survivor from the Pearl Harbor was there, and we had one of the oldest, well, not the oldest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5301)|
| 1:28:30| but he was a prisoner of war the longest. He was like over seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| He was there, and we had great fellowship there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| And remember, it's every third Saturday at 8 a.m., a free breakfast for your veterans, so get them out there. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5318)|
| 1:28:46| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5326)|
| 1:28:47| Yes, sir. I just wanted to get this on y'all's calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5327)|
| 1:28:49| I think Ed Schaus is real good about getting this out, but September the 8th, lunch at the fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| It'll be the first day of the fair kickoff, and so if you haven't already gotten that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| make sure it's probably the best sandwich bar on fairgrounds you'll ever get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5338)|
| 1:29:04| But come out, it'll be several hundred people there, and I think this year's fair is going to be really, really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5344)|
| 1:29:13| September the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5353)|
| 1:29:16| And speaking of lunch, now I'm going to go to receptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5356)|
| 1:29:23| Madam Director of the Commission Office, how much did we spend on the recent retirement reception?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5363)|
| 1:29:32| So if you can do math, I'd like for you to take your part of $200 to resupply, to replenish our check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5372)|
| 1:29:51| No, I'm not going to call it payday. It's the flower fund. It's the flower fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5391)|
| 1:29:57| $200 is what we spent on the reception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| Are there any other announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| Seeing no further discussion, I would like to remind you again, as I started this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5405)|
| 1:30:10| by asking that you remember Sam McKenzie and the passing of his father.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| And with that, we're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170717?start=5416)|
