| 0:33:48| like to discuss this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| In other words, draw anything off of consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2030)|
| 0:34:00| Seeing no lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| or further discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2042)|
| 0:34:04| Do I hear a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2044)|
| 0:34:06| that the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2046)|
| 0:34:08| that the discussion items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2048)|

| 0:34:25| I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| pause for just a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| for the item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| 901| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2075)|
| 0:34:37| I want to do 901 next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| On page 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| Consideration of a resolution of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| Commission of Knox County, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2086)|
| 0:34:48| approving a residential lease agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2088)|
| 0:34:50| with Allentown Carter & Sons LLC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2090)|
| 0:34:52| for the Knox County Recovery Court to lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2092)|
| 0:34:54| a house located at 2236| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2094)|

| 0:35:04| at a cost of $850 per month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| Resolution 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| I believe this item was held off of consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| for consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| because there was insufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2114)|
| 0:35:18| information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2120)|
| 0:35:22| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2122)|
| 0:35:24| I'll go ahead and make a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| just so we can talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| Do I hear a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2130)|
| 0:35:32| Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2132)|
| 0:35:34| do you wish to start the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| I think one of the items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| if you don't come down, I think you've got to give your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| I think one of the items we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2144)|
| 0:35:46| I guess it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2146)|
| 0:35:48| changed on here. Have you already leased this house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| I'm Ron Hanover, the director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2152)|
| 0:35:54| of the Knox Recovery Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| and Knox County Veterans Treatment Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| and also with me is the Honorable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| Charles Cerny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| who is the judge for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| Veterans Treatment Court and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| Who's the owner of this house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| I believe it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2171)|
| 0:36:15| Citizens Bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| That's the security deposit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2177)|
| 0:36:25| Yeah, but it's not on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2187)|
| 0:36:29| And so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| didn't start in June when the last documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2191)|
| 0:36:33| we had said it started in June or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| May or June or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| Yes, that was a draft and so I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| since changed that to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| December 1st through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| June 30th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| And the funding for this, the $850 a month, is it going to come through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| drug court costs that are charged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2207)|
| 0:36:49| to the occupants of drug court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2209)|
| 0:36:51| It comes from a grant from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| State Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2215)|
| 0:36:57| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2217)|
| 0:36:59| Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| I was reviewing your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2223)|
| 0:37:05| revised lease agreement and I noticed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| like you said, the agreement starts on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| December 1st, but you have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| expiring on 6-30 of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2231)|
| 0:37:13| 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2233)|
| 0:37:15| I'm sorry, that was a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| It was supposed to be 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| Okay, and then also in the agreement it says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| that you're a month-to-month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2241)|
| 0:37:23| basis for that lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2243)|
| 0:37:25| and that at the end of the lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| that it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| the landlord can raise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| rates at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| point. Is that something that you want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| to be locked into when you get somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| first there for six months and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| Yes, what this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| negotiated this particular property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| to be able to house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| veterans and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| non-veterans of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| Recovery Court and Veterans Treatment Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| We've got the funds and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| they're set aside through this particular grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2279)|
| 0:38:01| won't be occupying it, we won't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| putting occupants in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| until we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| get additional funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2287)|
| 0:38:09| or separate funds that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| will not go through the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| and at that time, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| I anticipate to be a couple of months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| we will end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| this particular lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| and then the non-profit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| friends of the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2303)|
| 0:38:25| Recovery Court will pick up the lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| will have a new lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| and then at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| we will put occupants in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2311)|
| 0:38:37| We actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2317)|
| 0:38:39| have a pretty friendly landlord| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| person who is in fact a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| veteran of our armed services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2325)|
| 0:38:47| I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| he was in fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| an Air Force officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| and he's also a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| person who has successfully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| completed our Veterans Treatment Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| so he's very sympathetic with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| us being able to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| this additional service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2343)|
| 0:39:05| to the persons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2345)|
| 0:39:07| who are participating in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| Veterans Treatment Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2349)|
| 0:39:11| and Knox County Recovery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| One of the things that we have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| is there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| times when our participants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2357)|
| 0:39:19| have to have a place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2359)|
| 0:39:21| to live where they can be away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| from people they used to use with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| and that they've become criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| justice system involved with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| and sometimes they're not able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2369)|
| 0:39:31| to get into halfway house situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| or some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| the shelters are not the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| situation for them and in addition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| the folks who provide this grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| our State Department of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| has asked us to basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| shop for a place to put folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| We also anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| that if managed correctly, we'll actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| stay in the black.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| Maybe even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| cash flow a little bit positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2397)|
| 0:39:59| So we do in fact need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2399)|
| 0:40:01| sign a lease with this provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2401)|
| 0:40:03| honestly before we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| lose this house to somebody who wishes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2405)|
| 0:40:07| to rent it as a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2407)|
| 0:40:09| We think that we can put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| up to about six people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2411)|
| 0:40:13| if I recall correctly, five people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| And we think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| this is going to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| much more beneficial situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| for folks who need this type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| Gill. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I just have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| a couple of questions. I think you answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| the number of participants that could stay in the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| Do you have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| indication that you have case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| management services to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| some support for veterans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| and was it a requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| of your grant and how long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| was your grant and how much money was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2447)|
| 0:40:49| Just for the cost of housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| That's a bunch of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| Just hopefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| they're simple though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2455)|
| 0:40:57| Do you provide case management services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2457)|
| 0:40:59| for support for your veterans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| We'll have to tag team that a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2461)|
| 0:41:03| Our recovery court staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| which doubles as our veteran treatment court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2465)|
| 0:41:07| staff, provides case management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2467)|
| 0:41:09| services and counseling services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2469)|
| 0:41:11| And we see to it that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2471)|
| 0:41:13| all participants are referred to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| appropriate agencies, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| but not limited to the VA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| any halfway house, but in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2479)|
| 0:41:21| this case we're contemplating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2481)|
| 0:41:23| a residential situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| when we can't access a halfway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| house circumstance. I don't know if you knew this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| but we're very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2489)|
| 0:41:31| grateful to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2491)|
| 0:41:33| steps providing housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2493)|
| 0:41:35| to many veterans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2495)|
| 0:41:37| And they've got a veteran section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| With respect to our grant, I think it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| remain renewable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| indefinitely, but Ron would probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2503)|
| 0:41:45| have to address that more directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| in the state of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| law that Governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| Bredesen passed, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2513)|
| 0:41:55| had passed, in 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| that we got ongoing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2517)|
| 0:41:59| grant funds from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| to provide these services for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| So unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| some catastrophe happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2525)|
| 0:42:07| we anticipate continuing to have these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| We also anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2529)|
| 0:42:11| I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2531)|
| 0:42:13| staff that I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| assign to go over there twice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| a day. We also have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| leased recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| court van that we can transport| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| participants between the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| office that we provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2547)|

| 0:42:31| outpatient treatment to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2551)|
| 0:42:33| We also do three drug screens a week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| to start off, and we supervise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2555)|
| 0:42:37| them really closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2559)|
| 0:42:41| Are there other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2561)|

| 0:43:17| Point of order, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| In the motion to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| we need to change the date on that lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| on that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| Can we make sure that that's noted in there as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| June 17| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2609)|
| 0:43:31| instead of June 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| Is it in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2613)|

| 0:43:37| It's on the lease agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2617)|

| 0:43:53| Consideration of the closure of a portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2633)|

| 0:43:57| last approximately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| 1,300 feet of Lovelace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2639)|

| 0:44:33| Just wanted to advise the body that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2673)|
| 0:44:35| both the parties that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2675)|

| 0:44:39| and there are folks here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2679)|
| 0:44:41| who are opposed to the closure as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| By way of background, the closure was initiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| when property owners on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| affected street contacted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| Mr. Snowden and explained the nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| of their request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| Jim has observed our standard procedures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| which is to circulate the required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2697)|
| 0:44:59| request to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2699)|
| 0:45:01| folks who have sought it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| They've completed that paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| appropriately and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2705)|
| 0:45:07| been added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| Beyond that, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2709)|
| 0:45:11| would just request that the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| give both parties the opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| speak to the matter and then we'll be glad to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2715)|
| 0:45:17| any questions from a transportation standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2717)|

| 0:45:23| Anyone here to speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| the closure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| Speaking to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| Speaking in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2730)|

| 0:46:04| closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| We have two categories of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| issues that we're trying to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2768)|
| 0:46:10| in this closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2770)|
| 0:46:12| Traffic and safety concerns and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2772)|

| 0:46:16| And we think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| the closure of this portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| of the road will address those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2780)|
| 0:46:22| for our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2782)|
| 0:46:24| Our neighborhood has a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| unique circumstance in which the road dead ends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| into the lake. It is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2788)|
| 0:46:30| a county park or a TVA park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| It's a very small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2792)|
| 0:46:34| narrow neighborhood road that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| dead ends into the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| There's no paved turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| There are two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2802)|
| 0:46:44| TVA parks close to our location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2804)|
| 0:46:46| that can handle traffic flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| parking, turning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2808)|

| 0:46:54| Hickory Creek, which is three miles from our location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2814)|

| 0:46:58| six miles from our location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| Its public use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| has always caused issues for the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| owners around it, but as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| Hardin Valley area population increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| it is becoming more and more of a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| And we fear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| as the area continues to grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| the problem will continue to increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| The road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2836)|
| 0:47:18| is barely big enough to handle the traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| from the homes that are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| much less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2842)|
| 0:47:24| the additional traffic that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2844)|

| 0:47:40| not aware that the road dead ends into the lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| it's causing an unsafe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2862)|

| 0:48:00| area of illegal activity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| we have drug use going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| at the end of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| and they're leaving their needles and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| paraphernalia behind for the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| to clean up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2890)|

| 0:48:34| We have people blocking the road due to no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2914)|
| 0:48:36| parking. These are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| the issues that our community faces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2918)|
| 0:48:40| in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| and we believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| the closure of this small portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| approximately the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| 1,300 feet of this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| which adjoins no other roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| will address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2932)|
| 0:48:54| these concerns. I don't know if they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2934)|
| 0:48:56| them available. I have some pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| that I brought just to give everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| a visual. I know we provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| a plot map and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| paperwork request that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| you can see the road and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2946)|
| 0:49:08| property, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| I'm a visual person, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| I provided some pictures to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| so you could see the road. So this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2954)|
| 0:49:16| where the turnaround, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| are proposing the turnaround would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| so the road would end here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| and there's the sign that the county posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2962)|
| 0:49:24| of notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| The next picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2966)|
| 0:49:28| is again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| just continuing on down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| the road, and you can see that it is extremely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| narrow. It is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2976)|
| 0:49:38| average road. It's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| dead-end road, and it's very small and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2980)|
| 0:49:42| narrow. Next picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| Again, we're getting closer to the end, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2984)|
| 0:49:46| you can see the further you go down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2986)|
| 0:49:48| the more it narrows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2988)|
| 0:49:52| Next picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2992)|
| 0:49:56| Next picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2996)|
| 0:49:58| This is the end. This is the lake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| area, the end of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3000)|
| 0:50:02| Like I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| It's not a boat ramp. It's not a TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| boat ramp. Yes, the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3010)|
| 0:50:12| bed is there, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| people can launch a boat there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| but you have to use someone's driveway to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| turn around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3018)|
| 0:50:20| Anything bigger than a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3020)|
| 0:50:22| small boat and one person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| you can't turn around without using one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| residents' driveway to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3026)|
| 0:50:30| Next picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3030)|
| 0:50:34| We have two houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3034)|
| 0:50:36| that are extremely close, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| these are my neighbors who are feeling the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| brunt of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| Next picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| It's happening in their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3044)|
| 0:50:46| front yard and backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| Next picture, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3048)|
| 0:50:50| Again, just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| the road. Next picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3052)|
| 0:50:54| I have one here with my vehicle on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| so you can kind of get a reference as to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| exactly how narrow the road is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| And there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| the plot map. Also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| to be noted, we will not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| be limiting TVA land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3066)|
| 0:51:08| access. This map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3068)|
| 0:51:10| shows the blue area labeled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3070)|
| 0:51:12| number two is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| TVA land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| It is on both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| of the lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3078)|
| 0:51:20| but our turnaround would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3080)|
| 0:51:22| far enough this side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| that all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3084)|
| 0:51:26| we would be limiting is vehicle traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3086)|
| 0:51:28| They would still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| be accessible by foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3090)|
| 0:51:32| to all areas of the TVA land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3092)|
| 0:51:34| Some of my neighbors would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3094)|
| 0:51:36| to give their personal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| experiences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| and the issues that they've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| We will continue with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| speaking in favor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3108)|

| 0:52:18| at the top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3138)|
| 0:52:20| Could I get you to speak a little bit closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3140)|
| 0:52:22| to the microphone and give your name again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3142)|

| 0:58:28| signs down there that you're being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| video monitored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| It seems to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3512)|
| 0:58:34| not deter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3514)|
| 0:58:36| Yesterday afternoon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| I hate to limit you on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3518)|
| 0:58:40| your speech, but this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| is only the first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| of this item. It will be heard again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| next month. If you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| other additional information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3528)|
| 0:58:50| that you feel pertinent right at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| moment, continue. But if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| a continuation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| events, I think we've heard enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| events to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| help us with our decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| Continuing on with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3544)|
| 0:59:06| those speaking in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3546)|
| 0:59:08| of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| My name is Amanda Ridley, and I live at 13220| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3554)|
| 0:59:16| Lovelace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3556)|
| 0:59:18| And give me your name again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3558)|
| 0:59:20| Amanda Ridley. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| And I live about 33| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3562)|
| 0:59:24| yards from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| picture of the water. And I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3566)|
| 0:59:28| tell you just briefly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| we've had to call the police four times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3570)|
| 0:59:32| just this summer. Now two of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3572)|
| 0:59:34| times, it's about a 25-minute response time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| Two of the times people left, the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3576)|
| 0:59:38| two times they didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| I've had to walk down there by myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| unarmed, at night, when it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3582)|
| 0:59:44| completely dark, not knowing what I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| walking into to make people leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| At least probably eight to ten times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3588)|
| 0:59:50| Just myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3590)|
| 0:59:52| And as Ken had said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| it's just a matter of time before it's one person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3594)|
| 0:59:56| who's not going to tolerate it and is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| retaliate against us. This is really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3598)|
| 1:00:00| about just keeping the eight or nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3600)|
| 1:00:02| kids that live on this road and the grandkids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3602)|
| 1:00:04| that live on this road, giving them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| a safe place to be. Because as of right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| now, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| So, thanks. Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3610)|
| 1:00:12| Speaking in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| of this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| Jonathan Schulte. I live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3616)|
| 1:00:18| at 13176 Lovelace Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3618)|
| 1:00:20| I'm the furthest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| end of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| But we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| down there quite often with our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| And it is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3630)|
| 1:00:32| I can't stress enough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3632)|
| 1:00:34| how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3634)|
| 1:00:36| the idea of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3636)|
| 1:00:38| having to pick up drug needles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3638)|
| 1:00:40| and, you know, the beer cans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| and the trash and all that, I mean, that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| But the drug needles are just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| I mean, it's not acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3646)|
| 1:00:48| And aside from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3648)|
| 1:00:50| personally, my biggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| fear is for Amanda and Ken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| with someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| to go crazy down there one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3656)|
| 1:00:58| and someone get shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| That's my two cents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| Does anyone else wish to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3664)|

| 1:01:16| for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| It's Melissa Wells. My address is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| 13172 Lovelace Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3680)|
| 1:01:22| And I live next to Amanda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| We're the next house up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| we've been there the longest. My mom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3688)|
| 1:01:30| over here, she's been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| 42 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| This has been an ongoing issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| for 42 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| at this point, we don't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| use the lake anymore. We don't go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| there. We live there. We don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| use it. We don't use it because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| there's always an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| with trash, drug needles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| people coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| You know, you just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| can't enjoy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| really, Ken said it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| with what he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3724)|

| 1:02:42| C-R-I-G-G-E-R, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| live at 2707| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3764)|
| 1:02:46| Pine Hill Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3766)|
| 1:02:48| It's a subdivision adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| to Lovelace Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3770)|
| 1:02:52| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3772)|
| 1:02:54| since they built the lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3774)|
| 1:02:56| I have used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| this road as a kid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| and have grown up down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| there. My great-aunt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| owned the place before they built the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| It's been a problem since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| I've known it, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3788)|
| 1:03:10| the cops come down and clean it up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| and then a while later, it's another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| problem. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| like when my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| kids, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3798)|
| 1:03:20| drop the boat off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| I back it in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| and there is a turnaround there at the oak tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| I always use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3806)|
| 1:03:30| He drives the boat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| around to the house, and I take the boat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| and the truck back to the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| And even in the evenings, picking it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| It was worse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| before they had to sign up. It said day use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| I went down there on people's camping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3824)|
| 1:03:46| and am able to turn around and drop the boat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| off and leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| Went down there Sunday evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3830)|
| 1:03:52| with my new wife,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3832)|
| 1:03:54| and she couldn't believe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| I said, well, you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| petition for anything, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| closing down a public road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| will limit the use of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| people in the area for having a boat launch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| all I want to say. And that drug use needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| to be stopped. And when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3850)|
| 1:04:12| things are going on, you need to call the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| and not take matters into your own hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| I've been in that situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| That's about all I need to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3860)|
| 1:04:22| Thank you, Mr. Krueger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3862)|

| 1:04:28| for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3868)|
| 1:04:30| Stephen Campbell,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| 2015 Graybill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| And I've lived down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| 62 years, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| down there about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3880)|
| 1:04:42| two or three times a week, I've never seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| a needle laying nowhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3884)|
| 1:04:46| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| that's where everybody goes fishing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| That's where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| put our fishing boats in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| and it ain't right to close it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| and give a cupcake here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| move down there to the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| His own lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| Like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| it's three miles to the next boat launch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| by lake, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| six miles to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| Ain't but three all the way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| Milton Hill Dam on that side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| We let down there in Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| And we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| going there 52| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3922)|
| 1:05:24| and it just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| ain't right to close a public land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| And we talked to TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| and they said they couldn't do it anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| so the lady| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| was down there today, so we didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| find out nothing about it till Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3936)|
| 1:05:40| That's all I got to say. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| Thank you, Mr. Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3942)|
| 1:05:46| Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3946)|
| 1:05:48| My name's Richard Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| I live at 12924 Lovelace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3950)|
| 1:05:52| Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| I know it was proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| that there was supposed to be ten lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| past that house. There's only four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3958)|
| 1:06:00| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| the house is on the very end. They have access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3962)|
| 1:06:04| from another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3964)|
| 1:06:06| I was born and raised on this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| This road was named after my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| Back in 1961,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3970)|
| 1:06:12| my grandfather gave up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| five acres of land for the first part of that lake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3974)|
| 1:06:16| for that lake to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| And I'm just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| standing up for my rights that I'll be able to go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| and swim at that lake and launch a boat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| or fish or whatever I want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| It is a public TVA property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| and I don't see anybody to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| stop me from seeing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| I've done it for my whole life, for 51| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| years, and I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| continue doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3996)|
| 1:06:38| And I just think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| that we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| straighten it up. I understand it's not used as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| prohibited. If there's anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| down there, call the police. That's what their job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| is to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4008)|
| 1:06:50| And that's what I've got to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4010)|
| 1:06:52| Thank you, Mr. Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| Sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4016)|
| 1:06:58| your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4018)|
| 1:07:00| My name is Mike Stratton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4020)|
| 1:07:02| I live at 2611| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4022)|
| 1:07:04| Shoreline, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| the subdivision that is off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| Lovelace Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| I moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| there 28 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4034)|
| 1:07:16| used that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4036)|
| 1:07:18| road to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| launch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4040)|
| 1:07:22| several boats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| and it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| an easy place to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4046)|
| 1:07:28| Like the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4048)|
| 1:07:30| place that you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4050)|
| 1:07:32| launch a boat, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| say it's three miles, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4054)|
| 1:07:36| the three-mile one on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| Hickory Creek is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| adequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| The water there varies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4066)|
| 1:07:48| from one foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4068)|
| 1:07:50| to three feet deep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4070)|
| 1:07:52| It's very difficult to launch any kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4072)|
| 1:07:54| boat there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4074)|
| 1:07:56| We've...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4076)|
| 1:08:02| A little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| after I had moved there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| erected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| two guardrails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4090)|
| 1:08:12| One of them was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| pictured in the pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| that you were shown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4096)|
| 1:08:22| Those guardrails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| really inhibited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4104)|
| 1:08:26| taking any kind of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4106)|
| 1:08:28| larger craft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4108)|
| 1:08:30| runabout of any kind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4110)|
| 1:08:32| and launching it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4112)|
| 1:08:34| It made it very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4114)|
| 1:08:38| We blamed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4118)|
| 1:08:40| at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| TVA on doing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4122)|
| 1:08:44| because maybe they didn't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| patrol the area. I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4126)|
| 1:08:48| what the reason was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| and I don't know who did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| I had an understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| also that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| the access to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| lake was used by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| local fire departments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| to pull water to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| fight fires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4146)|
| 1:09:08| That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| another thing that I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4150)|
| 1:09:12| how accurate that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4152)|
| 1:09:14| but I had been told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| that over the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| It would be a loss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4162)|
| 1:09:24| for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| convenience of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| neighborhood I live in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| if that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| closed. I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| we have more traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4174)|
| 1:09:36| now on Hickory Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4176)|
| 1:09:38| and on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| Hardin Valley than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4180)|
| 1:09:42| we did have 28 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4184)|
| 1:09:46| but there's other ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| to deal with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4188)|
| 1:09:50| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| I am against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| Thank you, Mr. Stratton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| Ma'am, your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| for the record, and you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| done the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| My name is Deborah Mallard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| I live at 2609| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4206)|
| 1:10:08| Shoreline Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4208)|
| 1:10:10| That's next to Mr. Stratton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4210)|
| 1:10:12| and I agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4212)|
| 1:10:14| everything that he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4214)|
| 1:10:16| One question I would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| is how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| would closing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| part of that road guarantee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| that there's not going to be people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| coming back down there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| I think we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| looking at one particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| way that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4232)|
| 1:10:34| that the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4234)|
| 1:10:36| down there think might work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| but I think it's going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| something else to actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| get people from using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| that portion of the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| and perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| County Commission can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| look at the area and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| see a better way to maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| keep that unsavory traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4254)|
| 1:10:56| there, and that's what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4256)|
| 1:10:58| have to say. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4258)|
| 1:11:00| Thank you, Ms. Mallard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4260)|
| 1:11:02| Sir, I need your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4264)|
| 1:11:06| I'm Justin Ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4266)|
| 1:11:08| I live at 2419| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4268)|
| 1:11:10| Diggs Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| I'm in favor of leaving the area open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| I use the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| I'm 33 my whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| Grew up there, fishing the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4278)|
| 1:11:20| putting boats into my father and grandfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| I understand there's issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4284)|
| 1:11:26| wrongdoings in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| and I believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4288)|
| 1:11:30| that does need to stop by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4290)|
| 1:11:32| proper means and the residents not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4292)|
| 1:11:34| putting their sails out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| And I think we could leave the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| open and could do a better job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4300)|
| 1:11:42| of keeping the area open and clean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| and straightened up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4304)|
| 1:11:46| to where we could all use it and enjoy it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| and the residents of the area wouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4308)|
| 1:11:50| troubled by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4310)|
| 1:11:52| And that's what I have to say. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4312)|
| 1:11:54| Thank you, Mr. Ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| Anyone else to speak in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4316)|
| 1:12:02| Your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| for the record, please, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| Okay. My name is Joan Boyd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| and I live at 2616 Shoreline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4328)|
| 1:12:10| to State Road. That's in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4330)|
| 1:12:12| Shoreline to State subdivision right next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| to Lovelace Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| And I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| that it's a terrible problem at the end of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| road, but by day, there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| some of us local folks who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| might want to take a flat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| sort of walk and can't walk on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| hills, and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| are some other local folks who would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| just walk down with a fishing pole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| and cast a line in the lake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| because they don't have lake access otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4356)|
| 1:12:38| I just was wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| how that would affect walkers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| and people who want to walk in with a fishing pole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| if we wouldn't be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| use that anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4366)|
| 1:12:48| That's all. I just was curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4368)|
| 1:12:52| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4372)|
| 1:12:54| Anyone else speaking in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| Dwight, do you mind coming up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4380)|
| 1:13:08| Really kind of two questions, Dwight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| On KGIS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| where would the turnaround be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| if the road closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4394)|
| 1:13:16| occurred? What's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4396)|
| 1:13:18| last property on there? Is it Mr. Schult?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4398)|
| 1:13:20| Is it his property that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| road would terminus up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4402)|
| 1:13:24| Actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4404)|
| 1:13:26| Jelly, if you could throw those pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4406)|
| 1:13:28| back up there. Do you still have the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| No? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| The inland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4412)|
| 1:13:34| I guess, the cove or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4414)|
| 1:13:36| in reference to the cove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| where would the road stop in reference to the water stopping right there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| Probably about 1,200 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4420)|
| 1:13:42| above the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4422)|
| 1:13:44| where the road enters the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4424)|
| 1:13:46| Just for a little bit of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| background, I think, because this may be confusing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| I'm assuming the Commission knows this and you may not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4430)|
| 1:13:52| but the road obviously predates the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| Lovelace continued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4434)|
| 1:13:56| across and came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4436)|
| 1:13:58| the other side, we believe in Rhone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| County, and when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| the lake was impounded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4442)|
| 1:14:04| that was the condition that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| was left in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| Obviously, we don't ordinarily build a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| road right down to the edge of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4450)|
| 1:14:12| water like that. Just a little bit of background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| Let me ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4454)|
| 1:14:16| while he's addressing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| what is the width of the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| down through there? I'd have to defer to Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| He's actually done the site work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4462)|
| 1:14:24| There are no existing current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| county-owned property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4466)|
| 1:14:28| or real estate that would be called sacks, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4468)|
| 1:14:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4470)|
| 1:14:32| I'm not sure I followed the last question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4474)|
| 1:14:36| Basically, this was probably of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4476)|
| 1:14:38| appropriate width for the time that it was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4478)|
| 1:14:40| In effect, when the lake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| was impounded, it became a dead-end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4482)|
| 1:14:44| road for whatever reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| We'd have to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| 30, 40, 50 years to know why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| One of the things we've discussed internally is why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| there's no barricade at the end of it because,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4492)|
| 1:14:54| in theory, right now, a party could simply drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| down to the end of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| If you were from out of town, if you'd had too much to drink,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4498)|
| 1:15:00| if you were late and confused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| you literally could just drive into the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| That's just one of those legacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| questions to which we don't have a good answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4506)|
| 1:15:08| It is the way that it is because it's been that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| for who knows how many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| I was just building on Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4512)|
| 1:15:14| Anders' question of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4514)|
| 1:15:16| where would the turnaround be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4516)|
| 1:15:18| There is no turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| It's just a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| of a straight-sided, parallel...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4526)|
| 1:15:28| In effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4528)|
| 1:15:30| the area is functioning as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| ad hoc park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4532)|
| 1:15:34| but there was never a park there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| There was simply a road that continued on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| that was placed underwater when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| TVA impounded the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| The use has grown up subsequent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| to that, but as has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| been mentioned, there's not actually a park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| or any sort of public facility there. It's simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4548)|
| 1:15:50| the end of a public road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4550)|
| 1:15:52| at the beginning of a TVA lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| To your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| Mr. Andrews, if I understand correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4556)|
| 1:15:58| the distance is probably about 1,200 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| to the top of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4560)|
| 1:16:06| I've been out to Loveless,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| but I haven't went out to the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4568)|
| 1:16:10| insufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| docking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| and boat ramp access and parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| On the KGIS map,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| one side of the road is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| obviously TVA right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| and then on the other side is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| obviously residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| Does the county own any part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| between the water and the lake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| No, sir, not to my knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| By the way, Jim was pointing out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| right there in the picture where you see the sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4598)|
| 1:16:40| is the location of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4600)|
| 1:16:42| proposed turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4602)|
| 1:16:46| So TVA has access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| to all of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4608)|
| 1:16:50| all of that wooded areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| north of the current road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4612)|
| 1:16:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| I guess I'd characterize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4616)|
| 1:16:58| it as unimproved access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4618)|
| 1:17:00| Obviously, if TVA wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| undertake improvements, they certainly could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| But TVA would continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4624)|
| 1:17:06| to have access, and the property would still be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| right where it is, contiguous to the water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| Has TVA issued an opinion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| this closure? Not yet. Jim's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| in contact with them. He's going to do a site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4634)|
| 1:17:16| visit next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| Speaking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| candidly, obviously we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4640)|
| 1:17:22| their opinion to be a good cooperative partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4642)|
| 1:17:24| but at the end of the day, they can't obligate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4644)|
| 1:17:26| this commission to maintain a public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| facility up to the edge of their water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4648)|
| 1:17:30| if it's not the will of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4650)|
| 1:17:32| While we will solicit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| their opinion and hopefully have it prior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4654)|
| 1:17:36| to the next time you hear this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4656)|
| 1:17:38| from my standpoint, you're not bound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| by it at all. This is a county road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4660)|
| 1:17:42| We maintain it on your behalf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| If this body opts to close it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| we can close it. If this body opts to keep it open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4666)|
| 1:17:48| we can keep it open. And other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4668)|
| 1:17:50| than just the professional courtesy of giving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| TVA a right to weigh in on it, I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| think that they would have any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4674)|
| 1:17:56| bearing on your deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4676)|
| 1:17:58| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4678)|
| 1:18:00| if the road was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4680)|
| 1:18:02| the terminus, TVA could come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4682)|
| 1:18:04| on the other side if they wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4684)|
| 1:18:06| to grant boat access at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4686)|
| 1:18:08| the new dead end of Lovelace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| Road, and they have water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| and they have access to land and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| out there, correct? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4696)|
| 1:18:18| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4700)|
| 1:18:22| Thank you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4702)|
| 1:18:24| Chairman. If you're heading west on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4704)|
| 1:18:26| Lovelace and you hit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| Pine Hill Drive, how far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| would the turnaround be from Pine Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| Let me let Jim speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| to that since he's done the site visits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4714)|
| 1:18:40| Commissioner Schoonmaker, I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| entirely sure. I didn't measure that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4722)|
| 1:18:44| but it's several hundred feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| at least. Okay, because I'm trying to look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| at Google Maps, and so you think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| say a thousand feet from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4730)|
| 1:18:52| that road or not quite that far? It's kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| of hard to tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4734)|
| 1:18:58| I can measure it real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| Did you say Pine Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| John? Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| That's the first road to the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4744)|
| 1:19:06| or the last road to the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4746)|
| 1:19:08| as you're heading west on Lovelace? As the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4748)|
| 1:19:10| map implies, it's 2,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| From there to the end of the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| Well, not to the end, to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| requested terminus. Okay, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| fine. Thank you. So it would be 3,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| feet to the end of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| What I'm looking at is if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| this were to go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| they can also post a sign there that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| road's closed, you know, basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4768)|
| 1:19:30| 2,000 feet ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4770)|
| 1:19:32| So people can turn around at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4780)|
| 1:19:42| Dwight is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4782)|
| 1:19:44| and I'm looking at the same thing you're looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| John, Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4786)|
| 1:19:48| I'm assuming it's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| close to where the water begins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| is where we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| about on the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| Would that be a fair statement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4796)|
| 1:19:58| Yes. I think so. Okay. That gives me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4798)|
| 1:20:00| a better idea. So let's say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| we vote this to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| So they can then gate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| they can do whatever they want to then, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| All the residents. Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4810)|
| 1:20:12| We would, the property would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4812)|
| 1:20:14| revert to the petitioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| Knox County would no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| have any maintenance responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4818)|
| 1:20:20| So prospective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| maintenance, resurfacing, things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4822)|
| 1:20:24| that, we'd no longer provide winter weather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| treatments and things like that. It becomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| a private road. So with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| all that, I would want the petitioners to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| with all that that entails. Because, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| we would not maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4834)|
| 1:20:36| shoulders, we would not maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4836)|
| 1:20:38| the surface of the road, we would not provide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| you know, when we get to the end of the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| right-of-way, that is where we stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4842)|
| 1:20:44| And, Dwight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4844)|
| 1:20:46| I'm looking at this map as well. There's roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| either side. Have you heard of any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| complaints from the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| like on down Pine Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| any complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4856)|
| 1:20:58| around there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4858)|
| 1:21:00| Any complaints around there? Like Laurel Lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| that area, any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| activity on those roads as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4864)|
| 1:21:06| that you don't want to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4866)|
| 1:21:08| in that area? No, sir, not to my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4868)|
| 1:21:10| knowledge. But I would say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4870)|
| 1:21:12| most of what we've heard tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4872)|
| 1:21:14| has been what I characterize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4874)|
| 1:21:16| as sort of public order crimes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4876)|
| 1:21:18| Those wouldn't ordinarily come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4878)|
| 1:21:20| You know, obviously the reason we're in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| this discussion is because of the request for closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4882)|
| 1:21:24| But we don't have any sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| of what the Sheriff's Department's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| call volume there or anything like that has been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| We just came into this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| discussion, again, because the petitioners requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| the closure. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4896)|
| 1:21:38| Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| Mr. Van de Veet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4900)|
| 1:21:46| I was laying on the black. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4906)|
| 1:21:48| My concern is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| if we do close the road and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| the residents put up a gate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4912)|
| 1:21:54| then anyone else that wants to go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| fishing, whatever, they're trespassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| Will they not be trespassing if they...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| They could access the lake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4922)|
| 1:22:04| from the TVA property, but they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| could not access the lake from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4926)|
| 1:22:08| former section of Lovelace Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| And who owns the road after...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4930)|
| 1:22:12| Is Knox County still on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4932)|
| 1:22:14| or does it revert to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| homeowners? No, sir, it would revert to the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| Again, we'd give up the maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| responsibility. They would take on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| the responsibility of maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| for the paved surface, and it also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4944)|
| 1:22:26| would actually be added back by the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4946)|
| 1:22:28| assessor for purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| of taxation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4950)|
| 1:22:32| That would be a hardship on the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4952)|
| 1:22:34| that want to go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| there to the end of the street and fish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| even if they don't have a boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| If they want to carry a canoe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4960)|
| 1:22:42| down there, that would be a hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| on the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4964)|
| 1:22:46| I don't think... I don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| if... I guess my question here would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4968)|
| 1:22:50| then, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| vote to close the road, they put a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| gate up, that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| the only way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4976)|
| 1:22:58| we may have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4978)|
| 1:23:00| illegal activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4980)|
| 1:23:02| happening to stop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| If a gate's not put up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4984)|
| 1:23:06| who's to say that they're not going to go down there and trespass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| anyway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4988)|
| 1:23:10| Just by closing the road would not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4990)|
| 1:23:12| stop someone from going down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| to use the end of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| for a boat dock or a fishing spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| or swimming hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=4998)|
| 1:23:20| There are a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| questions here that we generally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| Jim and I are talking about this in the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5004)|
| 1:23:26| bring you no expertise and really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5006)|
| 1:23:28| shouldn't be a part of that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| One is the public order implications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| of how the property is used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5012)|
| 1:23:34| presently. That probably would be a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| for the Sheriff's Office. And then the other is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| this larger question of access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5018)|
| 1:23:40| to the lake for recreational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| purposes. Obviously, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| are other parks in the area with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| improvements such as garbage cans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| security lighting, boat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| ramps and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5030)|
| 1:23:52| I think it might be useful for this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| if between this meeting and the next meeting we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5034)|
| 1:23:56| provide you or actually ask Doug if he would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| provide you with a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| site map of those other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5040)|
| 1:24:02| facilities that are in that area and an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5042)|
| 1:24:04| inventory so that as you make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5044)|
| 1:24:06| your deliberations, you can consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5046)|
| 1:24:08| what all your options are and what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5048)|
| 1:24:10| implications are for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| related parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| Being a new member, never been on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5054)|
| 1:24:16| road closure before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| lead me through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5058)|
| 1:24:20| that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| to take place. Is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5062)|
| 1:24:24| just because illegal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5064)|
| 1:24:26| activity is at the end of the road, is that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| reason to close a road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| Let me let Jim answer that because he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5070)|
| 1:24:32| has been at the helm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5072)|
| 1:24:34| of so many more of these than I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| I will say that we look at this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| and again, because we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| talked about public order issues and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5080)|
| 1:24:42| talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5082)|
| 1:24:44| recreation and access to recreational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| facilities, we will come at it from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5086)|
| 1:24:48| point strictly of transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| value, whether or not we have a need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5090)|
| 1:24:52| to maintain this as a public facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| whether it is part of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| larger network of public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5096)|
| 1:24:58| transportation facilities and that should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5098)|
| 1:25:00| and typically is the limit of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| discussion. The other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5102)|
| 1:25:04| issues again as far as public order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5104)|
| 1:25:06| crime, as far as recreation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| we would want to defer to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| departments that are responsible for those, but I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5110)|
| 1:25:12| let Jim walk you through the process of a road closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5112)|
| 1:25:16| Yes, Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5116)|
| 1:25:18| You're right, typically on road closures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5118)|
| 1:25:20| they are more, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5120)|
| 1:25:22| we've had some where there's been safety related concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5122)|
| 1:25:24| you know, we want to close a road due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| unsafe conditions or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| in some cases, more often times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| it's due to a road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| that was platted and never constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| So essentially the road don't exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| and as long as all the adjoining properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| agree to it, it makes sense to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| However, in this case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5140)|
| 1:25:42| there are a few instances we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| had in, I guess, my 18 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5144)|
| 1:25:46| here, there's been a couple of these instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| where there have been some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| concerns with safety and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5150)|
| 1:25:52| and we have asked this body to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5152)|
| 1:25:54| hear that. I mean, Mike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5154)|
| 1:25:56| said we're going to be neutral on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| one way or the other. However,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| you know, the folks that are here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| and petitioning us, they do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| a concern and, you know, their concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| are the safety and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5166)|
| 1:26:08| So we wanted to at least, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| submit that to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| because based on the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| anybody can petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5174)|
| 1:26:16| the request of a road closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5176)|
| 1:26:18| As to my knowledge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5178)|
| 1:26:20| there's no specific guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5180)|
| 1:26:22| for that. Typically we close them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| due to safety or unused right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5184)|
| 1:26:26| However, in this case, these folks have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| the safety concerns. So it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| a little unusual, but I do believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5190)|
| 1:26:32| it meets the intent of the road closure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5192)|
| 1:26:34| process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5194)|
| 1:26:36| Mr. Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5196)|
| 1:26:38| so we're here tonight, comes back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5198)|
| 1:26:40| 30 days later. Comes at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5200)|
| 1:26:42| So we vote tonight and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5202)|
| 1:26:44| next meeting? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| Thank you. Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5206)|
| 1:26:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| My question is, if you access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| the water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| if you're coming off the water and you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| use this as a public dock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5216)|
| 1:26:58| if you close the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5218)|
| 1:27:00| how would you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| you still could potentially have the same kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| problems as you dock a boat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5224)|
| 1:27:06| in terms of your public order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5226)|
| 1:27:08| issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5230)|
| 1:27:12| closing the road wouldn't stop that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| if I access the water by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| boat. Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5236)|
| 1:27:18| correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| So if I come off the water and want to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5240)|
| 1:27:22| this facility, you could potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| still have some of the same public order issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| I'm a retired telephone guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5246)|
| 1:27:28| Are you asking the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5248)|
| 1:27:30| I'm asking the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5250)|
| 1:27:32| director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5252)|
| 1:27:36| If they come off the water on TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| land, they come off the water on TVA land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| TVA land will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5260)|
| 1:27:42| only reach so many feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5262)|
| 1:27:44| up before it hits the private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5264)|
| 1:27:46| property. The question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| and I don't know the answer to the question is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5268)|
| 1:27:50| whether these people are using private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5270)|
| 1:27:52| property as a park also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| or they're using TVA lands as a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5274)|
| 1:27:56| But they're using county road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| as access. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| the issue before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5280)|
| 1:28:02| Alright. Then that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5282)|
| 1:28:04| my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| And returning to, oh, okay. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5286)|
| 1:28:08| So I just want to know what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| would, have we looked at what it would take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5290)|
| 1:28:12| to improve facility access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| in that to make that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5294)|
| 1:28:16| a park or that is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| under consideration at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| I can answer that. Knox County would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| to purchase property to have a park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| That was the root basis of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5304)|
| 1:28:26| Is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| property that is currently owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| parallel lines that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| 12 feet apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| or 18 feet apart or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| I don't know the width of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| I assume we will hear that next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| month. And my last question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| is, when we looked at the slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5322)|
| 1:28:44| who are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5324)|
| 1:28:46| property owners present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5326)|
| 1:28:48| where the property is fenced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5328)|
| 1:28:54| That's what I wanted to know. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| to the right would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| are the other property owners here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5338)|
| 1:29:00| It's TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| See, I was a little confused on that. TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| and he's saying it's him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5344)|
| 1:29:06| Well, to the right, if they're heading westbound, it's TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| on the right and their property on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5350)|
| 1:29:12| Because that's what I was a little confused on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| when they began to speak. I wasn't real| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| clear when they put the slide up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| Come here, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| Commissioner Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| were you going to ask a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5364)|
| 1:29:26| I think what we've got here is a problem is that it's growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5366)|
| 1:29:28| And once upon a time, people that lived| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| on that road, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5370)|
| 1:29:32| accessed the water and had a good time. That's their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| neighborhood. And now it's grown. People have heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| about this and said, hey, I can go down this road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| and the lake's right there and you can put your boat in or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5378)|
| 1:29:40| I have one more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5380)|
| 1:29:42| other question I was really thinking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5382)|
| 1:29:44| In traffic calming that we do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5384)|
| 1:29:46| speed bumps, everything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5386)|
| 1:29:48| there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| certain guideline you follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5390)|
| 1:29:52| as who you listen to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| to decide what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| going to do, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| So you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| decide what those people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| that are affected by whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| changes could be made, and they get to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5404)|
| 1:30:06| by a majority vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5406)|
| 1:30:08| Yes, sir, that's correct. We term that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5408)|
| 1:30:10| influence area. And the influence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5410)|
| 1:30:12| area is designed to prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5412)|
| 1:30:14| people who live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| far outside, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| the neighborhood, but use it as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| an opportunity to cut through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| from voicing over the concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5422)|
| 1:30:24| of the folks that live immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5424)|
| 1:30:26| in the area that's affected by speeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| So in this case, is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| anybody outside of Lovelace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| that would be considered affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| by the closure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| I think that may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5436)|
| 1:30:38| the question that's before the body commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| because I guess these folks... I was hoping you would answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| I'll tell you what we will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| We will provide, since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| the core question seems to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| lake access, we'll provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5448)|
| 1:30:50| or ask Doug to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| or both a map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| that shows this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| and then ask him to show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| other locations he has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5458)|
| 1:31:00| nearby that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5460)|
| 1:31:02| equivalent or superior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5462)|
| 1:31:04| facilities in terms of boat ramps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| in terms of pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| access to the lake. I can't remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| Commissioner Daly or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5470)|
| 1:31:12| Commissioner Gill, somebody mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5472)|
| 1:31:14| pedestrian access to the lake. We'll ask Doug| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5474)|
| 1:31:16| to give you an inventory of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5476)|
| 1:31:18| the facilities in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5478)|
| 1:31:20| that he maintains that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| formal parks that would function| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| as a formal park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| And then if we are able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5486)|
| 1:31:28| pull any information from the sheriff's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| as far as call history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| or from 911, we'll try to provide that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| Hopefully it will help with these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| deliberations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5500)|
| 1:31:42| And just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| I believe Mr. Witt testified that he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| got 100% of the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| passed where they want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5508)|
| 1:31:50| close the road in support of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| the road closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5512)|
| 1:31:54| Is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| everybody's understanding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| Mr. Witt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| That is correct. All property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| are in favor. Everybody's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| that touches this road is in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5524)|
| 1:32:06| Also, I can answer the question as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5526)|
| 1:32:08| the width, if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| That was actually part of the proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| It is in the written proposal that I provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| The widest point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| is 14 feet. As we go down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| toward the end of the road, we're getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| narrower and narrower all the way down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| Okay. My question is not about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| width of the roadway. It's the width of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| What is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5546)|
| 1:32:28| owned by Knox County is the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5548)|
| 1:32:30| I understand. I'm sorry. I misunderstood you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| That's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5552)|
| 1:32:34| If there is nothing down through there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5554)|
| 1:32:36| except the road and no place for us to have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| turnaround even, then we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| imposing upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5560)|
| 1:32:42| other property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| As my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| and looking at TVA maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| if you would look at the pictures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| I don't know if that's possible. When we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| down there at the end of the road, the gentleman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| mentioned a guardrail earlier. That| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| is the edge of the TVA property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| That's the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5578)|
| 1:33:00| the guardrail was put up. You go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| past those guardrails, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| are now on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| resident's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| If you look at KGIS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| and other TVA maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5590)|
| 1:33:12| on the left side of the road going down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| you have property owner's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| You have the road. On the right side, you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| TVA property. There's no other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| property here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5600)|
| 1:33:22| Sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5602)|
| 1:33:24| give me your name again, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5604)|
| 1:33:26| I'm Kent Hargett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| I live at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5608)|
| 1:33:30| the very end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5610)|
| 1:33:32| That's my home up on the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| What do you wish to add| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5614)|
| 1:33:36| to the discussion? There's two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5616)|
| 1:33:38| The guardrails were put up by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5618)|
| 1:33:40| TVA and Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5620)|
| 1:33:42| because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5622)|
| 1:33:44| people were coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5624)|
| 1:33:46| down the road and taking four-wheelers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| and motorcycles up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| across and across the back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5630)|
| 1:33:52| I have several neighbors that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| will vouch for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5634)|
| 1:33:56| That was the reason they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| were closed off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| I'm an erosion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| control. I have a certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| for that and that's the reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| Second, my home is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5646)|
| 1:34:08| last one in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5648)|
| 1:34:10| that has dock rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| We're the last one that has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| In fact, when I went to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| apply for my dock, TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5656)|
| 1:34:18| wanted me to position my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| dock so I would block| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5660)|
| 1:34:22| this questionable area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| and I wouldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| For the sole reason, I try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| to keep it open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| for our neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| on a continuous basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| I can prove that at the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| probably the best person to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5678)|
| 1:34:40| is a TVA person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5680)|
| 1:34:42| that shows, I can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| show the plot that my property is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5684)|
| 1:34:46| last one that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| dock rights in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5690)|
| 1:34:52| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is my last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5694)|
| 1:34:56| Is this the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| request to close this road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5698)|
| 1:35:00| This is the first reading. We will read| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| this again next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| I'm a little confused because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5704)|
| 1:35:06| this road is 60 years old?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5706)|
| 1:35:08| This road is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| how the buffalo used to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| cross the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| So we've had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| 60 years worth of concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| but this is the first time somebody has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5718)|
| 1:35:20| come before the commission to request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5720)|
| 1:35:22| the road? That's what I'm trying to, I'm a little confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5722)|
| 1:35:24| This is the first time that Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| has been requested to close the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| Seeing no further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5732)|
| 1:35:34| discussion, am I correct? No further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| discussion. The motion that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| before us is to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5738)|
| 1:35:40| on first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5740)|
| 1:35:42| the termination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5742)|
| 1:35:44| of the last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| 1,300 feet of Loveless Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| Point of order. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5750)|
| 1:35:52| I would like to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5752)|
| 1:35:54| before we vote that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5754)|
| 1:35:56| my vote tonight is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5756)|
| 1:35:58| if new information comes out, it may change next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5758)|
| 1:36:00| I am going to vote in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5760)|
| 1:36:02| to let this move forward but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5762)|
| 1:36:04| if we go down there and see some things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5764)|
| 1:36:06| are different from TVA, my mind could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5766)|
| 1:36:08| change on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5768)|
| 1:36:10| That's the reason we read these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| twice because this is a political| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| issue. The building of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| roads is politic. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| closing of roads is politic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5778)|
| 1:36:20| Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5780)|
| 1:36:22| seated before us is only bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| us the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5784)|
| 1:36:26| Any further?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| The question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| Bustle, I did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| mean to wake you up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| I was sitting here trying to think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| what's positive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| and negative about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| If the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5802)|
| 1:36:44| is closed, is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| road part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| that live right on that road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| their road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5812)|
| 1:36:54| No, it's their real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5814)|
| 1:36:56| Only what's in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| of them. Will it have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| to be redrawn to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5820)|
| 1:37:02| this is new property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| that's added to their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5826)|
| 1:37:08| No rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| Reassess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| Reassess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5832)|
| 1:37:14| All their access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| is the road that's immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5836)|
| 1:37:18| in front of their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5838)|
| 1:37:20| toward the lakeside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5840)|
| 1:37:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| Now then, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| I feel the same way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| Brad does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| Being familiar with how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| TVA and the lakes and the dead end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5854)|
| 1:37:36| roads, because we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| up in Norris and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| we go through the same sort of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| I don't know, it's kind of just the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5864)|
| 1:37:46| drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| next to some of our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5868)|
| 1:37:50| that TVA has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5870)|
| 1:37:52| a gate up sometimes and sometimes they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5872)|
| 1:37:54| and they go out and they camp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| on the points and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| We've always been told TVA's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| property, they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| And they can access it from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5882)|
| 1:38:04| lake and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| that's why I want to see all this, because I want to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| how different it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5890)|
| 1:38:12| from what we've always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5892)|
| 1:38:14| experienced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5894)|
| 1:38:16| But I'd like to move it forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| like Brad says and then if there's other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| things that come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| to the next time we vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| and all. Because they both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| all, everybody makes a good point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5906)|
| 1:38:28| on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5908)|
| 1:38:30| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5910)|
| 1:38:32| Well I'm on the opposite side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| I believe Buffalo crossed first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| and the citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| come and they have the right to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5918)|
| 1:38:40| go down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5920)|
| 1:38:42| I think we're trying to solve a criminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5922)|
| 1:38:44| problem by closing the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5924)|
| 1:38:46| and giving property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| to the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| and I just don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| Commissioner Deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| Yes, thank you Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| Because I just don't have enough information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5936)|
| 1:38:58| and without the additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5938)|
| 1:39:00| information being provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| it's just difficult to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5942)|
| 1:39:04| make an adequate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| discussion. So I just wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5946)|
| 1:39:08| to make sure I say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| Motion is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=5950)|

| 1:53:48| may have created a problem here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6828)|
| 1:53:50| but you're recognized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6830)|
| 1:53:52| Thank you. Since the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6832)|
| 1:53:54| is not present, can we go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6834)|
| 1:53:56| and request that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| commission office send them a certified letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| asking them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| to appear at our December meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6842)|

| 1:54:08| exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6848)|
| 1:54:10| Because it's my understanding from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6850)|
| 1:54:12| conversations with the Metropolitan Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6852)|
| 1:54:14| Commission and the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| that the option on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| the land has expired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| and they potentially have no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6860)|
| 1:54:22| access to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6862)|
| 1:54:24| because of no agreements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6864)|
| 1:54:26| with the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6866)|
| 1:54:28| off of Harvey Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| Is that a fair statement, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| Mr. Kelly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| They have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6876)|
| 1:54:38| their access is challenged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6878)|
| 1:54:40| now according to the way they wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6880)|
| 1:54:42| develop the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6882)|
| 1:54:44| There is a dispute between the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6884)|
| 1:54:46| property owner and then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6886)|
| 1:54:48| proposed applicant which would make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6888)|
| 1:54:50| impossible to develop according to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| the plan that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6892)|
| 1:55:00| The reason I say we may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| be creating a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| is because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| rules that we have in effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=6906)|

| 2:03:10| on behalf of the Development Corporation of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| These particular applications for a sector plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7393)|
| 2:03:16| and rezoning are for two parcels totaling 3.64 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7396)|
| 2:03:23| They were in holdings within the Midway Business Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7403)|

| 2:03:30| with the surrounding zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7410)|

| 2:03:45| and is zoned EC Employment Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| And this is just making that property consistent with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7428)|
| 2:03:52| We believe changes in conditions since the 2010 sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7432)|

| 2:04:21| of Thorn Grove Pike and the improvement of Midway Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7461)|
| 2:04:25| The major changes have been changes in governmental policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7465)|
| 2:04:29| including the approval of sector plan amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7469)|
| 2:04:33| rezonings, and approval of development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7473)|
| 2:04:36| for approval of this property as a business park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7476)|
| 2:04:40| consistent with the changes in county policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7480)|

| 2:04:54| was submitted to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7494)|
| 2:04:58| We would request your approval of the two items, the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7498)|
| 2:05:02| amendment to BP-1 and the rezoning to EC Employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7502)|

| 2:08:33| in the zone request, let us focus on the Development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7713)|
| 2:08:36| Corporation's own traffic count numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7716)|
| 2:08:38| and consider that at an average of 15 gallons of gas per car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7718)|
| 2:08:43| 200 gallons of diesel fuel per truck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| this equals more than 300 million gallons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7725)|
| 2:08:48| of highly toxic fuel being stored and transferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7728)|
| 2:08:51| each year within this massive sinkhole drainage basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7731)|
| 2:08:55| The transfer and transport of 300 million gallons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7735)|
| 2:08:58| of petroleum in addition to all the other hazardous chemicals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7738)|
| 2:09:01| and materials in those trucks, together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7741)|
| 2:09:04| with the typical runoff associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7744)|
| 2:09:06| with hundreds of parked and idling trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7746)|
| 2:09:08| on 20 or more acres of paved parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7748)|
| 2:09:11| the disaster is not a question of if, but rather when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| and how severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7755)|
| 2:09:17| I share these thoughts with you with no illusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7757)|
| 2:09:19| that the environmental science or known risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7759)|
| 2:09:23| will disrupt the scheme to provide publicly funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7763)|
| 2:09:25| infrastructure for the influential special interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7765)|
| 2:09:31| I request of you, I remind you that the commission has never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7771)|
| 2:09:35| publicly acknowledged, discussed, or deliberated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7775)|
| 2:09:39| the published science, the associated warnings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7779)|
| 2:09:43| or required any dye test to survey the potential impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7783)|
| 2:09:47| on the watershed, nor have you engaged your own geologist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7787)|
| 2:09:50| hydrologist to advise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7790)|
| 2:09:52| You've relied upon the Development Corporation's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7792)|
| 2:09:55| veracity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| Our primary intent is to ensure there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7797)|
| 2:09:59| will be no plausible deniability or public liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7799)|
| 2:10:03| protection or personal liability protection for anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7803)|
| 2:10:07| knowingly and willingly enabling the destruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7807)|
| 2:10:11| of this irreplaceable resource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7811)|
| 2:10:14| And to assure that all who hear our concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7814)|
| 2:10:17| should know that they'll never be able to say they didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7817)|
| 2:10:21| Finally, and coincidentally, everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7821)|
| 2:10:23| should remember that 15 years ago yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7823)|
| 2:10:27| it also was settled with Knox County, Knoxville, Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7827)|
| 2:10:31| County, and the Development Corporation, SM&E,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7831)|
| 2:10:33| and Mr. Johnson, and others for dumping 800 dump truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7833)|
| 2:10:37| loads of diesel contaminated debris in a sinkhole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7837)|
| 2:10:40| in South Knoxville, polluting 17 wells,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7840)|
| 2:10:43| involving 150 plaintiffs, costing the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7843)|
| 2:10:46| and Knox County tens of millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7846)|
| 2:10:49| with no admission of guilt, personal consequence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7849)|
| 2:10:51| or prosecution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7851)|
| 2:10:52| See the newspaper article attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7852)|
| 2:10:55| The Midway Project involves more than 1,000 wells| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7855)|
| 2:10:58| and thousands of residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7858)|
| 2:11:01| Do the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7861)|
| 2:11:04| For the Midway disaster, or impending disaster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7864)|
| 2:11:08| our ultimate intent is to create a solid legal record that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7868)|
| 2:11:11| will ensure maximum consequences for everybody involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7871)|
| 2:11:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7877)|
| 2:11:19| Councilman McAdams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7879)|
| 2:11:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| Just two quick points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7887)|
| 2:11:28| The Development Corporation has had this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7888)|
| 2:11:30| studied repeatedly by engineering firms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7890)|
| 2:11:33| by geologists, and by environmental consultants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7893)|
| 2:11:37| Development Corp will comply with all applicable state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7897)|
| 2:11:40| federal, and local requirements, including| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| all environmental requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| The issues that Mr. Wolfenbarger raises| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| have been thoroughly addressed and will be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7906)|
| 2:11:49| as development proceeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7909)|
| 2:11:52| And this will be a very friendly, environmentally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7912)|
| 2:11:58| business park, or environmentally friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7918)|
| 2:12:00| business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7920)|
| 2:12:01| The runoff is more highly regulated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7921)|
| 2:12:04| within this business park than it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| is on any of the surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7926)|
| 2:12:09| The usage of chemicals and other potential contaminants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7929)|
| 2:12:16| such as septic tanks, will not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7936)|
| 2:12:18| permitted on this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7938)|
| 2:12:20| The Development Corporation is confident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7940)|
| 2:12:22| and its engineers are confident, that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7942)|
| 2:12:25| will be a safe property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7945)|
| 2:12:28| The other point in regard to the fuel center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7948)|
| 2:12:30| the rezoning to the EC Employment Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7950)|
| 2:12:35| zone that the Development Corporation has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7955)|
| 2:12:36| requested for this parcel and for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7956)|
| 2:12:39| the rest of the property does not permit fuel centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7959)|
| 2:12:44| There is no fuel center plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7964)|
| 2:12:46| A fuel center is not permitted in the zoning requested today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7966)|
| 2:12:51| or the zoning that you've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7971)|
| 2:12:53| approved for the remainder of the business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| We'll be happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7976)|
| 2:12:58| And Mr. Johnson and Mike Stomer with S&ME| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7978)|
| 2:13:02| are here if you have any engineering questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7982)|
| 2:13:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7985)|
| 2:13:07| Mr. Wolfenbarger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7987)|
| 2:13:12| Those traffic numbers came from their application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7992)|
| 2:13:16| So it may not be on their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7996)|
| 2:13:19| It's going to promote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=7999)|
| 2:13:21| And with regard to Mr. McAdams, he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8001)|
| 2:13:24| pretends he likes to pivot to stormwater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8004)|
| 2:13:27| We're not talking about stormwater here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8007)|
| 2:13:29| We're talking about the impending accident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8009)|
| 2:13:31| that's going to occur in these thousands of sinkholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8011)|
| 2:13:35| that are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8015)|
| 2:13:36| We're not talking about a sinkhole once every 100 yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8016)|
| 2:13:40| We're talking about a sinkhole or a depression,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8020)|
| 2:13:42| which is a closed mouth sinkhole that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8022)|
| 2:13:44| can walk from one to the other in feet, 10 feet, 5 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8024)|
| 2:13:48| That's why the US Geological Survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| if you look at that map that I provided for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8031)|
| 2:13:53| all those pimpled areas tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8033)|
| 2:13:56| or should tell you, that this is a unique site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8036)|
| 2:14:01| There's about 15 of these sites throughout the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8041)|
| 2:14:04| This is the largest one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8044)|
| 2:14:06| This is not voodoo science here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8046)|
| 2:14:09| I mean, if the US Geological Survey said this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8049)|
| 2:14:12| printed these maps since 1940, and then in 1995,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8052)|
| 2:14:17| the NPC staff stated in the East Knox County Sector Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8057)|
| 2:14:21| that this site is unsuitable for industrial activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8061)|
| 2:14:25| I mean, it's unambiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8065)|
| 2:14:27| It's clear as daylight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8067)|
| 2:14:29| They can talk all the silly talk they want to talk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8069)|
| 2:14:32| but they picked the wrong site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8072)|
| 2:14:35| Because it's near an interchange,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8075)|
| 2:14:36| doesn't make it suitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8076)|
| 2:14:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8079)|
| 2:14:40| Mr. Wolfenbarger, I asked a moment ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8080)|
| 2:14:42| was there anyone else who wished to speak in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8082)|
| 2:14:45| I'm sorry, I did not pause to recognize that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8085)|
| 2:14:49| Was there anyone else here to speak in opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8089)|
| 2:14:52| I don't know of anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| I mean, we're just creating a legal record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8093)|
| 2:14:57| because it's going to be a disaster,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8097)|
| 2:14:59| and we want folks to have options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8099)|
| 2:15:02| And one last time, Mr. McAdams, commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8102)|
| 2:15:08| do you have any questions of those who have presented?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8108)|
| 2:15:12| Seeing no one asking a question, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8112)|
| 2:15:14| make a motion that this request be approved for NPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8114)|
| 2:15:20| recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8120)|
| 2:15:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8121)|
| 2:15:23| Seeing no further discussion, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8123)|
| 2:15:25| probably before us to approve for NPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8125)|
| 2:15:29| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8129)|
| 2:15:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8131)|
| 2:15:32| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8132)|
| 2:15:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8133)|
| 2:15:35| Thank you, Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8135)|
| 2:15:42| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8142)|
| 2:15:44| 10-H-16-RC is a request of the Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8144)|
| 2:15:49| of Knox County for rezoning from A, agricultural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| to E, C, employment center, property located northwest side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8151)|
| 2:15:56| of Thorngrove Pike, north of I-40,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8156)|
| 2:15:58| southwest of Midway Road, in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8158)|
| 2:16:03| I recognize that the applicant and the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8163)|
| 2:16:09| is still in attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8171)|
| 2:16:12| The Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8172)|
| 2:16:14| recommends approval of the E-C zoning for this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8174)|
| 2:16:21| consistent with the action that they took on the sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8181)|
| 2:16:23| amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8183)|
| 2:16:26| This is a logical extension of the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8186)|
| 2:16:28| again, surrounded by other E-C zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8188)|
| 2:16:32| And a portion of the property in question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8192)|
| 2:16:35| a portion of the property in question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8195)|
| 2:16:38| according to their approved concept plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8198)|
| 2:16:40| will be used for road improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8200)|
