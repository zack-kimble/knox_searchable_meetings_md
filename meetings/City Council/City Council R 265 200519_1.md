| 2:52:29| to Knoxville, but that's not the issue about bringing tax dollars or jobs. The issue is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10349)|
| 2:52:35| what's the interpretation? And the people from Estes make a big point about saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10355)|
| 2:52:40| oh, it's clear that C6 allows truck parking. I have before me, and I sent in a letter from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10360)|
| 2:52:49| March 21st, 2019, which was right at the time of the original MPC meeting from Scott Elder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10369)|
| 2:52:58| Zoning Chief, City of Knoxville to John Sanderson. This is the same person that Mr. Aaron sent his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10378)|
| 2:53:04| letter to, and it's a zoning letter, and it says the C6 portion of the lot may not be used as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10384)|
| 2:53:14| storage lot for tractors, trailers, equipment, or freight. So the idea that the C6 is clearly a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10394)|
| 2:53:22| could be, could be used for tractors is sort of silly. If C6 could be used for tractors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10402)|
| 2:53:30| why in the first place did they even ask for rezoning? It's sort of silly, because the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10410)|
| 2:53:36| point that a lawyer for Estes and Smithbilt and Primos Land made in the City Council appeal last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10416)|
| 2:53:44| year was that, hey, if we don't get this rezoned, we can't park tractors there, and so therefore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10424)|
| 2:53:51| you know, we need to get it rezoned. 30 seconds to go. 30 seconds. That's my rebuttal. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10431)|
| 2:53:58| Thank you, Mr. LeBlanc. Council members, that concludes the parties who are speaking to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10438)|
| 2:54:04| Now you have an opportunity to discuss it. Ms. Rider, go ahead. I would like to ask Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10444)|
| 2:54:12| Aarons to clarify a few things. We've heard a lot of discussion here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10452)|
| 2:54:20| some of which doesn't bear on the decision. It's my understanding the decision that we are making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10460)|
| 2:54:25| is the interpretation of the zoning administrator, which is Mr. Aarons. Mr. Aarons, could I get you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10465)|
| 2:54:33| to speak on who makes the interpretations of the code that we have, and how did we get here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10473)|
| 2:54:44| and what does the split zoning accomplish? Mr. Aarons? Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Peter Aarons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10484)|
| 2:54:51| Director of Plans Review and Building Inspections. I'm the zoning administrator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10491)|
| 2:54:54| I'm tasked with interpreting and enforcing the zoning code. Split zoning is, it's not common,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10494)|
| 2:55:04| but it's, we've had zoning letters about them in the past, and we really, in those situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10504)|
| 2:55:12| we look at what the appropriate and permitted uses are for each of the zones, and we make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10512)|
| 2:55:18| one doesn't bleed into the next. The letter that Scott sent is accurate when it says the C6| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10518)|
| 2:55:26| portion of the site may not be used as a storage lot for tractors, trailers, equipment, or freight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10526)|
| 2:55:31| A storage lot is something that's long-term versus when you've got truck sales service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10531)|
| 2:55:41| and accessories, and the C6 allows the parking of these trucks or equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10541)|
| 2:55:49| as long as it's not located in a required parking spot. So, Estes, Mr. Sanderson came back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10549)|
| 2:55:59| apparently and asked for more clarification, and a lot of times they'll do that when it is split| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10559)|
| 2:56:05| zoned. They want to make sure that what they're proposing meets the zoning requirements, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10565)|
| 2:56:12| specifically, there was more than just the employee parking. There was parking for trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10572)|
| 2:56:18| or equipment as well. Well, not equipment, but there was parking for trucks as well. I looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10578)|
| 2:56:25| the, at this point in time, I recognized that this was contentious, and there was some talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10585)|
| 2:56:33| that trucks couldn't even park on that part of the property, and so I looked into what C6 does allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10593)|
| 2:56:41| to see if it's the actual presence of the trucks or if it's the activity of the terminal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10601)|
| 2:56:47| that's prohibited in the C6, and in conferring with Gerald Green, the Executive Director of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10607)|
| 2:56:54| Planning, we agreed that the presence of trucks is not prohibited, but the intense use associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10614)|
| 2:57:05| with a terminal is prohibited in the C6, and so that's why in the zoning letter, I made it clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10625)|
| 2:57:12| that any activity associated with the terminal, and I put some examples in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10632)|
| 2:57:20| loading, unloading, hitching, unhitching, those activities need to take place in the I-3 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10640)|
| 2:57:29| so I feel confident that what they're proposing is not an intense I-3 use in the C6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10649)|
| 2:57:42| from what it was described to me, employees come, they drive their personal vehicle to the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10662)|
| 2:57:49| they park, they walk to their truck, they get in their truck, and they go to the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10669)|
| 2:57:55| and so from my perspective, that's not I-3 activity, that's what's permitted in the C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10675)|
| 2:58:06| Does that answer your questions, ma'am? Yes, so you answered another question I had here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10686)|
| 2:58:12| what can be done in the I-3 zone that can't occur in the C6 zone, so you were talking about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10692)|
| 2:58:19| terminal, so that's what we've accomplished by maintaining the split zoning, is pushing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10699)|
| 2:58:27| terminal activity to the further back part of the property, and maintaining a large buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10707)|
| 2:58:35| What are the required parking spaces for this development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10715)|
| 2:58:42| You said as long as it's a storage, they can't use, they have to maintain the required parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10722)|
| 2:58:50| spaces, so what are they having to maintain, and they're allowed to have the parking in the C6?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10730)|
| 2:58:56| So, the required parking was calculated based on the size of the terminal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10736)|
| 2:59:03| and they met those requirements, in addition to those minimum requirements, they added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10743)|
| 2:59:10| the additional truck parking within the C6. I think it's important to note that many times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10750)|
| 2:59:18| terminals have storage areas where there might be broken down trucks that are in need of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10758)|
| 2:59:24| there might be trailers that are in need of repair, those are the sorts of activities that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10764)|
| 2:59:30| we would consider a storage yard, that would also be prohibited in the C6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10770)|
| 2:59:35| that would be allowed in the back of the property. And so, another thing to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10775)|
| 2:59:44| we keep talking about C6, we just made the transition to the new zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10784)|
| 2:59:49| which that new property is zoned as, the property is now rezoned as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10789)|
| 2:59:58| I believe it's CR2, which also allows for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10798)|
| 3:00:04| Is it CH2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10804)|
| 3:00:05| Or CH2, I believe so. I'm trying to pull it up real quick. I looked at this the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10805)|
| 3:00:14| and it does allow for... I apologize, I'm scrolling through on my iPad here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10814)|
| 3:00:31| Yes, the CR does allow for heavy retail rental and service, which is consistent with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10831)|
| 3:00:39| Let me jump to the definitions real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10839)|
| 3:00:42| But it's CH, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10842)|
| 3:00:43| Yes, I'm sorry, I keep saying...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10843)|
| 3:00:45| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10845)|
| 3:00:55| So, is the plan allowed, the use allowed in the new zoning versus the old zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10855)|
| 3:01:05| They're very similar. The heavy retail rental and service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10865)|
| 3:01:08| indicates that...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10868)|
| 3:01:14| Here we go. Examples of heavy retail rental and service establishments include large-scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10874)|
| 3:01:20| home improvement centers with outdoor storage, display, and rental components,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10880)|
| 3:01:25| lumber yards, recreational vehicle dealerships, boat sales, rental and service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10885)|
| 3:01:31| truck rental establishments, and sales, rental, and repair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10891)|
| 3:01:35| truck rental establishments, and sales, rental, and repair of heavy equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10895)|
| 3:01:40| So, that is consistent with the language of the C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10900)|
| 3:01:44| And so, no matter the zone, I think what they're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10904)|
| 3:01:49| meets the base zone, whether it be CH or C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10909)|
| 3:01:58| Okay, so my last question I asked you about the required parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10918)|
| 3:02:01| They've been allowed, as long as they have their required parking separate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10921)|
| 3:02:05| your determination is that they can have the cabs, the tractors, of the trucks on the C6 buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10925)|
| 3:02:16| What, how do we, what, how do we tell them where they can park them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10936)|
| 3:02:23| So, in the previous code, there were no maximum parking requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10943)|
| 3:02:28| And so, they met their minimum for the employee parking and visitor parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10948)|
| 3:02:34| as it was, it was identified before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10954)|
| 3:02:37| And on their site plan, we counted up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10957)|
| 3:02:44| traditional passenger vehicle spaces, and they met those minimum requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10964)|
| 3:02:49| And then those additional spaces were, they are oversized and more in line with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10969)|
| 3:02:56| spaces that are appropriate for the cabs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10976)|
| 3:02:58| So, those, those are not to be parked in the passenger vehicle area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10978)|
| 3:03:08| but they can be parked in that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10988)|
| 3:03:16| Okay, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10996)|
| 3:03:17| Basically, they've got twice as many parking spots as they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=10997)|
| 3:03:21| and, or as are required, and half of them are going to be trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11001)|
| 3:03:27| half of them are going to be the employee's personal vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11007)|
| 3:03:35| Okay, the, the language where they were talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11015)|
| 3:03:39| you cannot park trucks or heavy equipment in required spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11019)|
| 3:03:43| that, those are the situations where, if folks don't have enough room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11023)|
| 3:03:48| and they've got their required spaces, and then we get complaints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11028)|
| 3:03:54| or we see that they're occupying those required spaces with display vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11034)|
| 3:04:00| with display equipment, and there's not enough room for employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11040)|
| 3:04:08| customers, those that are frequenting the establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11048)|
| 3:04:12| That's when we would come in there and say, look, you're required to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11052)|
| 3:04:16| you're required to have X number of parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11056)|
| 3:04:21| Where are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11061)|
| 3:04:22| And that's where, as we would walk the site with, with the property owner or tenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11062)|
| 3:04:28| if we saw that they had display vehicles or display equipment in those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11068)|
| 3:04:32| we would say you need to move those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11072)|
| 3:04:36| And how is that enforced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11076)|
| 3:04:41| Not proactively at the, at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11081)|
| 3:04:46| Obviously, if we see an issue, we'll address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11086)|
| 3:04:50| We've got folks that are driving around, and when we do see issues, we try and track them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11090)|
| 3:05:00| It's a bad time to ask about enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11100)|
| 3:05:02| We're doing a lot of things remotely right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11102)|
| 3:05:05| Okay, well, I don't mean in a pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11105)|
| 3:05:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11107)|
| 3:05:08| I'll, I'll see if others may have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11108)|

| 3:05:15| Do we, how many, do we know how many employees that they have or anticipate for this location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11115)|
| 3:05:25| I do not know that answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11125)|
| 3:05:27| I would imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11127)|
| 3:05:29| Does anybody with Estes be able?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11129)|
| 3:05:33| Someone from Estes able to answer that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11133)|
| 3:05:36| Ma'am, currently it's 104 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11136)|
| 3:05:40| We expect that to grow to as many as 167 in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11140)|
| 3:05:48| Councilwoman Testerman, any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11148)|
| 3:05:50| Yeah, I'm just, I'm struggling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11150)|
| 3:05:52| I think I'm struggling with, you know, a year ago between council and Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11152)|
| 3:06:00| Knox County Planning Commission denying the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11160)|
| 3:06:07| So I'm not sure how, trying to figure out how we got here in a year's time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11167)|
| 3:06:16| Mr. Ahrens, do you want to comment on the differing conversations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11176)|
| 3:06:24| I was not part of the planning commission conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11184)|
| 3:06:29| nor was I part of the city council conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11189)|
| 3:06:34| I became involved when the zoning letter became an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11194)|
| 3:06:41| Other than that, I don't have a good answer for you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11201)|
| 3:06:48| But what we've accomplished by maintaining the zoning is keeping the terminal pushed back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11208)|
| 3:06:56| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11216)|
| 3:06:58| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11218)|
| 3:07:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11220)|
| 3:07:01| So I don't think there's any question as to whether a terminal can be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11221)|
| 3:07:06| And in my zoning letter, I attempted to emphasize that all of those activities need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11226)|
| 3:07:15| taking place at the back of the property so that we don't have, you know, the beeping backup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11235)|
| 3:07:22| horns or sirens that are going on constantly in that C6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11242)|
| 3:07:26| Um, all of that intense use needs to take place back in the industrial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11246)|
| 3:07:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11256)|
| 3:07:37| Any more questions, Ms. Ryder? Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11257)|
| 3:07:40| I was going to make a motion if anybody, if nobody has any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11260)|
| 3:07:47| Ms. Singh? Ms. Singh and then Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11267)|
| 3:07:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11271)|
| 3:07:52| Councilwoman Ryder, I know that you're very thorough in your research and you generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11272)|
| 3:07:57| try to get people to come to talk to each other and reach some sort of compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11277)|
| 3:08:02| But when Esty's folks were speaking, I didn't hear any reference to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11282)|
| 3:08:10| discussions to the neighborhood or any compromises that have been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11290)|
| 3:08:15| Um, so these conversations began in February, um, renewed, and, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11295)|
| 3:08:25| I, I was going to say, let's have a sit down and have a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11305)|
| 3:08:28| Uh, and unfortunately, once the appeal is filed, I can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11308)|
| 3:08:33| Um, so I did, um, have our attorney, Mr. Frost, reach out to the parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11313)|
| 3:08:41| The parties involved, um, and, and one of the speakers did mention that there were conversations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11321)|
| 3:08:46| back and forth. Um, I just, it, it, much to my chagrin, it's still maintained to be an appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11326)|
| 3:08:53| situation where we are faced in deciding if Mr. Aaron's interpretation of, of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11333)|
| 3:09:01| And, um, I'm, you know, it, it clearly says truck sales are allowed in C6 and, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11341)|
| 3:09:11| and so that's the interpretation that he has given and, and that's what I struggle with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11351)|
| 3:09:17| Um, you know, we did maintain the buffer. The terminal is that far back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11357)|
| 3:09:24| And, um, I, I would hope Esty's will continue conversations with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11364)|
| 3:09:32| I think what Mr. Aaron's has said to us here is regardless of how we decide on this appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11372)|
| 3:09:38| a truck terminal can still be there. There's still a large portion of industrial there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11378)|
| 3:09:45| And that's been for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11385)|
| 3:09:49| I think Mr. Thomas had his hand up. I don't, I don't know if anybody else has anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11389)|
| 3:09:54| Yeah. Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11394)|
| 3:09:55| Yes. Ms. Singh, uh, actually asked one of my questions and I'll just reiterate, it's always a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11395)|
| 3:10:01| the better option, you know, especially when you're dealing with that much property. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11401)|
| 3:10:06| some of it may not be suitable, but for the parties to get together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11406)|
| 3:10:09| sometimes you can get close to win-win situations or at least amicable situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11409)|
| 3:10:19| In light, a bit of what, uh, council person Testament said, I'm bothered a bit by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11419)|
| 3:10:24| inconsistency that we might be having here. If the council a year or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11424)|
| 3:10:29| interpret it one way, and now we're being asked to interpret it another way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11429)|
| 3:10:33| which is the way I'm kind of understanding this, that, uh, that, uh, presents a problem for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11433)|
| 3:10:40| Uh, then the other thing is, um, possibility that we're not going to be able to enforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11440)|
| 3:10:47| uh, this, you know, and I'm afraid the temptation is going to be, uh, strong for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11447)|
| 3:10:54| a business of any kind, uh, park their trucks here or park it there. And, uh, so, um,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11454)|
| 3:11:01| this, how we're spread thin as far as enforcement, uh, concerns me on this. So those are just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11461)|
| 3:11:07| comments. Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Uh, Ms. Fugate, and then we'll do Ms. Testament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11467)|
| 3:11:15| Thank you. Um, this is a very confusing situation. I think my, the other concern I have now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11475)|
| 3:11:24| is if we have a corporation that has done acts based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11484)|
| 3:11:33| opinion they have gotten from the city of Knoxville, what does, what kind of liability does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11493)|
| 3:11:41| that, um, give to the city? Um, maybe one of our attorneys can talk to about that, but if a city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11501)|
| 3:11:49| employee interprets zoning and tells someone that something works or how, I mean, I wasn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11509)|
| 3:11:59| on council when all this happened, but I just think it's confusing if they go through a process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11519)|
| 3:12:08| get an opinion that says what they want to do is okay, and then it's appealed. It, I just think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11528)|
| 3:12:15| that also is troubling. Somebody help me with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11535)|
| 3:12:25| Mr. Swanson, you're muted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11545)|
| 3:12:29| I can help you with the liability question. Uh, and really we don't have any significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11549)|
| 3:12:36| liability in this area. Uh, what we have is our, uh, chief building official and our chief zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11556)|
| 3:12:45| administrator for the city, uh, offering a, his interpretation of the code, which he is authorized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11565)|
| 3:12:52| to do by the code, uh, and the law as it exists, uh, would support his ability to do that, would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11572)|
| 3:13:00| not, uh, provide any real sense of liability, uh, to either to the city or to the individual who| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11580)|
| 3:13:07| makes that interpretation. Uh, so that, that's kind of where we are. And if, if, if somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11587)|
| 3:13:13| made a mistake earlier on in giving advice about what was permitted and what's not permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11593)|
| 3:13:19| that still allows, uh, Peter Arians to, to provide the correct advice, uh, in his interpretive letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11599)|
| 3:13:31| Thank you, Ms. Testerman. Uh, Ms. Fugate, did you have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11611)|
| 3:13:34| I was just going to say thank you. That's exactly what I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11614)|
| 3:13:38| Okay. Ms. Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11618)|
| 3:13:40| Can I ask, um, was Director Green there? Is there something that he can lend to this conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11620)|
| 3:13:47| Director Green, are you on the call still? There you are. Mr. Joe, could you...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11627)|
| 3:13:55| Yes, I'm here. Yes, thank you. Gerald Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11635)|
| 3:13:59| Director of Knox County Planning. The, the history, and I'm not sure what I can add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11639)|
| 3:14:05| is that there was a rezoning request to rezone what was then the C6 parcel to I-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11645)|
| 3:14:13| That was denied because, as Mr. Arians explained, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11653)|
| 3:14:17| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11657)|
| 3:14:21| use, uses permitted in the I-3, including truck terminal activity itself, did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11661)|
| 3:14:28| seem appropriate to the Planning Commission nor to the City Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11668)|
| 3:14:32| and so the rezoning was denied. And from that point on, we were not heavily involved. Mr. Arians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11672)|
| 3:14:40| came to me to run his interpretation by me, and his reasoning seemed sound, and I agreed with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11680)|
| 3:14:52| Thank you, Mr. Green. Ms. Testerman, did you want to follow up questions for him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11692)|
| 3:14:57| No, I think I just, I kind of wanted to see where he landed or what historic perspective he had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11697)|
| 3:15:04| Okay. Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11704)|
| 3:15:06| So, Mr. Green, to, just to have you clarify, you and Mr. Arians did confer on that, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11706)|
| 3:15:15| determination that we're discussing right now. Yes, ma'am, that's correct. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11715)|
| 3:15:24| I'm ready to make a motion. Okay. I would like to make a motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11724)|
| 3:15:32| Okay, is there a second to the motion? Ms. Ryder made a motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11732)|
| 3:15:37| Is there a second to this motion? I'll second for the sake of discussion, which is what we just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11737)|
| 3:15:44| Okay, motion made to deny the appeal by Ms. Ryder, seconded by Ms. Fugate. Discussion? Ms. Singh?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11744)|
| 3:15:54| Ms. Singh? Yes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11754)|
| 3:16:01| Is, when the neighbors were speaking, there was mention of putting up fencing, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11761)|
| 3:16:10| Estes did put up some fencing. Anyway, I'm wondering if I could speak to some, if some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11770)|
| 3:16:16| of the neighbors would speak on, is there anything with this situation that they feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11776)|
| 3:16:21| a compromise, some landscaping or some sort of compromise that would make them feel better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11781)|
| 3:16:31| Is there someone from the neighbor side? I'm looking for someone to raise their hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11791)|
| 3:16:39| Okay. Mr. LeBlanc has raised his hand. Okay, Mr. LeBlanc. Mr. LeBlanc, you know, are we open to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11799)|
| 3:16:46| something? Yes. But realize that all this happened, all the appeals last April and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11806)|
| 3:16:57| with the city council, and then this zoning letter came out. We didn't hear about this zoning letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11817)|
| 3:17:03| until January of this year, and that's why then we said we started putting in appeals and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11823)|
| 3:17:09| Now, Estes says they never heard about it either, but you know, I would think that whoever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11829)|
| 3:17:14| was involved in it last year should have known the concern the neighbors had and should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11834)|
| 3:17:19| reached out to us. As far as I know, nobody reached out to us. Somebody reached out from Estes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11839)|
| 3:17:25| somebody called me last week, okay, and I had an extensive 30-minute conversation with that person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11845)|
| 3:17:32| okay, and explained the concerns and so forth. But my concern, and I thought that this city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11852)|
| 3:17:39| meeting was mainly about the interpretation and so forth. So, you know, if Estes wants to talk to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11859)|
| 3:17:45| some neighbors, I'm sure that I don't represent all the neighbors, okay. I probably represent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11865)|
| 3:17:51| some of them and have been heavily involved in this process, but if Estes wants to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11871)|
| 3:17:56| what can be done, then we're open to that. So, but so far, other than a call last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11876)|
| 3:18:06| sort of out of desperation because they'd never heard, you know, hey, this is brand new to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11886)|
| 3:18:11| we don't know anything about it. And this appeal has been going on to the BZA and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11891)|
| 3:18:17| And the other thing is just, it would be a simple matter for Estes to go through and just say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11897)|
| 3:18:23| let's do a BZA zoning variance and put trucks. And that way they can define, under that variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11903)|
| 3:18:29| they can define very carefully where the trucks are parked, how many are there going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11909)|
| 3:18:35| you know, trucks are always going to be facing out, that type of thing, as well as present to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11915)|
| 3:18:39| the neighbors what they're doing, rather than just, we're looking at a, the picture Mr. Roten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11919)|
| 3:18:47| put up there and trying to figure out what's a tree, what's a fence, what's a, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11927)|
| 3:18:52| those type of things. So no, we don't think that Estes has been forthcoming in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11932)|
| 3:18:58| trying to work with neighbors. Now they may say we haven't been forthcoming either, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11938)|
| 3:19:05| that's the situation. Thank you. Any more questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11945)|
| 3:19:13| Yes. I'm sorry. I'm just trying to really understand what happened about rezoning. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11953)|
| 3:19:22| there was an attempt to have it rezoned to all industrial, and that is what City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11962)|
| 3:19:29| said no to. And then they came back and asked, well, if, can we build the terminal part on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11969)|
| 3:19:41| the industrial part and use cab parking in Seaside so that we can still buy this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11981)|
| 3:19:48| and build our terminal? Is that kind of what I'm understanding here, Peter, or Mr. Ayer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11988)|
| 3:19:54| Yes, ma'am. That's my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11994)|
| 3:19:59| C6 accomplishes a couple things. It keeps the terminal in the back of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=11999)|
| 3:20:05| and it also requires a landscape plan before we had landscape requirements that needed to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12005)|
| 3:20:11| through planning staff and get approved. There's design standards for those landscaping buffers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12011)|
| 3:20:17| So it's my understanding that that was the logic behind maintaining that C6 strip as a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12017)|
| 3:20:29| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Ayers, Ms. Huguette. Any other questions from Council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12029)|
| 3:20:37| We have a motion. Oh, Ms. Singh. Yes. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12037)|
| 3:20:41| I am wondering if both parties are willing to sit down with each other and see if they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12041)|
| 3:20:46| work on something, because this is, as you were saying, I'm sorry, I forgot your name,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12046)|
| 3:20:52| that you just heard about this last week. Do you guys feel that that's a possibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12052)|
| 3:21:04| Ms. Singh, you're directing your question to both parties, basically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12064)|
| 3:21:07| I am. I'm sorry, I wasn't clear. Yeah, I'm wondering if both parties are willing to sit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12067)|
| 3:21:13| down and discuss this and see if they can find a compromise on this before. If they need to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12073)|
| 3:21:21| back to Council, that's okay, but if they could work it out on their own, that would be probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12081)|
| 3:21:26| better for both parties. Mr. LeBlanc has raised his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12086)|
| 3:21:32| Okay, Mr. LeBlanc. The answer from me is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12092)|
| 3:21:37| Someone from the Estes Company want to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12097)|
| 3:21:47| Ms. Maidment has raised her hand. Ms. Maidment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12107)|
| 3:21:53| While we would be open to discussing things, I did try to do so with Mr. LeBlanc, and he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12113)|
| 3:22:00| stated that he wanted to keep his cards close to the vest and did not want to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12120)|
| 3:22:08| what his issues were for a compromise prior to this meeting. So I did not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12128)|
| 3:22:14| anything to work with at the time, and we've been working on this project for nine months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12134)|
| 3:22:22| and we have equipment sitting on the site. We were at the point of the permits ready to roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12142)|
| 3:22:27| when we were made aware of this. So while we were always open to talking with neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12147)|
| 3:22:32| about processes, we believe that we have met the requirements and then some as to proper buffers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12152)|
| 3:22:41| landscaping that instead of an eight-foot tree, we're putting in a 12-foot tree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12161)|
| 3:22:45| We have designated areas because of wetlands and topography to add to the setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12165)|
| 3:22:53| and we've tried to address traffic issues based on what the city has asked. As far as delaying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12173)|
| 3:22:59| this vote, I don't think it's fair and reasonable to ask us to wait to do so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12179)|
| 3:23:04| but are we open to having a sit-down discussion with the neighbors? Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12184)|
| 3:23:11| Thank you, Ms. Maidment. Any other questions or discussion among council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12191)|
| 3:23:19| Mr. Thomas. I would just like to reiterate I'm in sympathy with the comments of Ms. Singh. I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12199)|
| 3:23:25| really like for the parties to at least give this a try because this is a tough issue, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12205)|
| 3:23:33| I see both sides of it. If they could somehow take a little bit more time and maybe two weeks or a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12213)|
| 3:23:42| month and try to work something out on this because both sides have their own views and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12222)|
| 3:23:49| lot of it is credible on each side, so I don't know if that's possible. It would be up to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12229)|
| 3:23:55| but those are my sentiments as well. Mr. Frost. Yes, I'm not taking sides or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12235)|
| 3:24:05| but there is a motion already on the floor. Thank you, Mr. Frost for the reminder. Is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12245)|
| 3:24:13| any other discussion on the motion on the floor which is to deny the appeal? It's been made by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12253)|
| 3:24:21| Councilwoman Ryder, seconded by Councilwoman Fugate. Any further discussion? Seeing none,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12261)|
| 3:24:27| please do a roll call vote. Councilwoman Ryder. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12267)|
| 3:24:34| Councilman DiBerto. Yes. Councilwoman Singh. Yes. Councilman Smith. Yes. Councilman Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12274)|
| 3:24:47| Can I clarify? Yes to uphold the appeal. Yes to deny the appeal. The motion on the floor is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12287)|
| 3:24:54| deny the appeal, so a yes vote denies the appeal. I'm just going to say, based on Council and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12294)|
| 3:25:03| Planning Commission's 12 months ago, I'm going to vote to approve the appeal. The motion on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12303)|
| 3:25:13| floor is to deny, so that would be, I think what you want to do is vote no is what you're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12313)|
| 3:25:19| say? No, I'm voting to approve. This has gotten so confusing. If this motion were to fail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12319)|
| 3:25:38| you would have a chance to make a motion to approve it, and then you could vote in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12338)|
| 3:25:42| of the appeal. The motion is upholding the building administrator's determination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12342)|
| 3:25:52| if that helps. So the appeal is to say, my motion was to, sorry, I don't know if somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12352)|
| 3:26:03| wants to help me now. I can't believe we've gotten this far. Okay, my motion is to deny the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12363)|
| 3:26:08| meaning that I am siding with the building administrator, and just before anybody, I feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12368)|
| 3:26:14| bad because a couple people have already voted, but I knew where my vote was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12374)|
| 3:26:18| That does not preclude any continued conversations and negotiations. It's just that the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12378)|
| 3:26:24| being filed precluded me from having conversations with any parties involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12384)|
| 3:26:29| I'm voting to uphold the appeal by Mr. LeBlanc. So then you would vote no to my motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12389)|
| 3:26:40| Okay, no. No by Ms. Testerman. Please continue the roll call vote. Councilman Thomas? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12400)|
| 3:26:50| Councilwoman Fugate? Yes. Vice Mayor McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12410)|
| 3:27:00| Yes. Councilman Parker? No. Is that 6-3? Yes, ma'am, 6-3 in favor of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12420)|
| 3:27:14| Okay, and no votes for Ms. Parker, Ms. Testerman, and Mr. Thomas. That's correct. I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12434)|
| 3:27:22| I don't know if I have to say that. I think someone said I have to say that. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12442)|
| 3:27:27| thank you. Let's move on to the next item, 10-B. Oh, no, no, 11-A. Yes, ma'am, 11-A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12447)|
| 3:27:34| Mayor, do you mind hanging on just a moment? I just had a comment to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12454)|
| 3:27:39| Councilwoman Ryder, so at this point, you can have conversations, and if you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12459)|
| 3:27:47| if they will sit down and have discussions, you'll be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12467)|
| 3:27:49| I relish that opportunity. I always, I always want to do that. This is never what I want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12469)|
| 3:27:59| Never. Thank you. No, didn't want this. Other council members are free to do that, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12479)|
| 3:28:06| if they wish. Mr. Thomas? Yeah, not to pile on, but any efforts that are still within the realm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12486)|
| 3:28:13| of possibility for these parties to sit down and become better neighbors, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12493)|
| 3:28:22| I would encourage. That's all. Thank you, Mr. Thomas. As we approach our 10 o'clock hour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12502)|
| 3:28:32| if anyone needs to dismiss themselves to use the facilities, go ahead, but let's not take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12512)|
| 3:28:36| a recess in the interest of time, and that's okay with everybody. All right, let's move on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12516)|
| 3:28:42| to item 11-A, please. 11-A is a resolution respectfully requesting that Governor Lee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12522)|
| 3:28:49| and the members of the Knoxville Legislative Delegation consider a path forward to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12529)|
| 3:28:53| the necessary steps to accept Medicaid expansion for Tennessee. Motion to approve. I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12533)|
| 3:29:01| Motion made by Councilwoman Ryder, seconded by Councilwoman Fugett. Ms. Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12541)|
| 3:29:06| I would like to add my name as a co-sponsor to this resolution, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12546)|
| 3:29:12| Okay, let the record reflect that Ms. Testerman is a co-sponsor in addition to the other co-sponsors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12552)|
| 3:29:18| Ms. Fugett? Thank you, Mayor. That's why I seconded it. I, too, want to be added as a co-sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12558)|
| 3:29:25| I don't know if we have to amend by consent. Y'all will let us pile on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12565)|
| 3:29:34| Do we have to do an amendment to add people to the sponsorship?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12574)|
| 3:29:41| There's no problem with adding sponsors if they ask to be included as sponsors at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12581)|
| 3:29:47| Okay. Anytimes. Thank you. Ms. Ryder? Yeah, so it will be reflected that it was unanimous. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12587)|
| 3:29:55| appreciate that. I just wanted to say that, real quickly, this is becoming a very long meeting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12595)|
| 3:30:02| we're not done yet. Anyway, I'm encouraged by some of the renewed bipartisan discussions that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12602)|
| 3:30:09| Tennessee legislature has initiated. There have been opinion pieces and articles to expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12609)|
| 3:30:16| Medicaid. It's been a long discussion. It's been four years of lots of stalling and stall-outs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12616)|
| 3:30:24| I think this is really important. I've never made it a secret that Medicare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12624)|
| 3:30:28| and access to healthcare is important to me. Healthcare access gives us the ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12628)|
| 3:30:35| maintain good health through preventative care. It gives us negotiated pricing on medicines like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12635)|
| 3:30:41| insulin, allergy medicines, heart medications, and seizure medications. Just tip of the iceberg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12641)|
| 3:30:47| there. It gives people the ability to negotiate pricing on urgent care or surgery care. It keeps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=12647)|

| 3:43:31| Ms. Malia, are you on the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13411)|

| 3:43:49| Council in support of the resolution. Okay. Is there anyone else who signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13429)|
| 3:43:57| to this item? I don't think so. Jennifer Stambaugh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13437)|
| 3:44:01| Yes, ma'am. Ms. Stambaugh, are you on the line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13441)|
| 3:44:06| Yes, I am. Okay. Thank you for staying with us for so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13446)|

| 3:44:23| My reasons for supporting this resolution are threefold. Firstly, political, secondly, practical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13463)|
| 3:44:30| and thirdly, personal. For political reasons, I have a master's degree in teaching and work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13470)|
| 3:44:35| in the schools. It's been long established that the right to a free education is guaranteed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13475)|
| 3:44:41| the Constitution. However, as the past couple months have demonstrated, you can't access your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13481)|
| 3:44:46| right to an education if you as a child or your parents or teachers are sick. Therefore, the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13486)|
| 3:44:52| to an education also necessitates the right to healthcare as well. It is impossible to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13492)|
| 3:44:58| school and get your constitutionally protected right to an education if you are sick. Life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13498)|
| 3:45:04| liberty, and pursuit of happiness are not possible if you are dying or confined to a bed by an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13504)|
| 3:45:10| illness that would be preventable if you had healthcare. Secondly, I support this for practical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13510)|
| 3:45:16| reasons. Ensuring healthcare as a human right would actually improve the economic standing of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13516)|
| 3:45:22| our country. 22 different studies have now been done that prove that Medicare for all would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13522)|

| 3:45:41| savings is a reduction in administrative costs. There's also savings from having a uniform electric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13541)|

| 3:45:54| reducing the possibility for fraud. Also, with people having access to healthcare, they would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13554)|
| 3:46:03| get underlying conditions treated preventatively. For example, going to a routine checkup and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13563)|
| 3:46:10| getting put on high blood pressure medicine is a lot cheaper than an ambulance ride, emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13570)|

| 3:46:21| And thirdly and finally, I support this for personal reasons. I believe it is morally wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13581)|
| 3:46:26| for our country to put any other issue as more important than the health of its citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13586)|

| 3:47:19| and healthcare as a human right is the only moral solution both for helping my family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13639)|
| 3:47:25| and for helping out everyone else in our communities. Thank you for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=13645)|

| 3:53:52| I just have a quick question out of curiosity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14032)|
| 3:53:55| Does the university have any responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14035)|
| 3:54:00| or help with any of the infrastructure on campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14040)|
| 3:54:03| that just crossed my mind as I was reading through this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14043)|
| 3:54:10| Ms. David Brace could answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14050)|
| 3:54:12| I mean, I'm pretty, I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14052)|
| 3:54:14| I better let someone else answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14054)|
| 3:54:15| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14055)|
| 3:54:16| Answer it incorrectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14056)|
| 3:54:17| David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14057)|
| 3:54:18| Yeah, Mr. King can jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14058)|
| 3:54:19| Sorry, I walked outside to walk my dog, so it's dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14059)|
| 3:54:23| So very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14063)|
| 3:54:26| Yes, UT is responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14066)|
| 3:54:28| for the infrastructure on their campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14068)|
| 3:54:30| There are projects that we collaborate with UT on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14070)|
| 3:54:33| in areas around campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14073)|
| 3:54:35| And so, but within the campus itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14075)|
| 3:54:38| and the streets that they own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14078)|
| 3:54:39| they handle all of the maintenance within those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14079)|
| 3:54:42| So does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14082)|
| 3:54:44| Yeah, I just didn't know what type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14084)|
| 3:54:46| you know, how, what that shared responsibility looked like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14086)|
| 3:54:49| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14089)|
| 3:54:50| Yeah, all of those landscaping improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14090)|
| 3:54:52| that you see within the interior portions of campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14092)|
| 3:54:55| are all handled by the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14095)|
| 3:54:57| And those are their streets to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14097)|
| 3:55:00| Again, there are connections around campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14100)|
| 3:55:02| that we collaborate on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14102)|
| 3:55:03| and then there's areas around campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14103)|
| 3:55:05| that are our streets that we handle everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14105)|
| 3:55:07| But along Cumberland and the intersections along Cumberland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14107)|
| 3:55:11| and that project, we've collaborated with UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14111)|

| 4:00:37| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14437)|
| 4:00:38| Just briefly, I think we all know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14438)|
| 4:00:39| that this is one of the most important things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14439)|
| 4:00:42| we can be doing and I know all of you are quite aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14442)|
| 4:00:45| of what this system does here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14445)|
| 4:00:50| And as far as I'm concerned, we've cracked the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14450)|
| 4:00:53| It's very important that we've cracked the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14453)|
| 4:00:55| as far as being able to give some assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14455)|
| 4:00:58| to homeless and mentally ill people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14458)|
| 4:01:00| that are in the conflict between minor violations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14460)|
| 4:01:04| and going to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14464)|
| 4:01:06| So this is a great start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14466)|
| 4:01:08| It came about through a collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14468)|
| 4:01:10| between the county and the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14470)|
| 4:01:12| maybe three or four years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14472)|
| 4:01:14| And I would like to see us continue this and build on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14474)|
| 4:01:17| So that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14477)|
| 4:01:20| Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14480)|
| 4:01:22| I do think someone from Helen Ross MacDowd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14482)|
| 4:01:24| Houston Smeltzer is here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14484)|

| 4:01:29| and think it's a good part of the solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14489)|
| 4:01:33| Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14493)|
| 4:01:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14495)|
| 4:01:37| Yeah, I think we did a good job with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14497)|
| 4:01:40| we had a plan in action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14500)|
| 4:01:41| and then the state pulled their funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14501)|
| 4:01:45| So I know we had to really roll and change things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14505)|
| 4:01:49| I am hoping that we're able to enlarge the capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14509)|
| 4:01:55| to make this a bigger project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14515)|
| 4:01:59| It sounds like a good place to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14519)|
| 4:02:03| So yeah, I just hope we're able to build on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14523)|

| 4:02:28| I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14548)|
| 4:02:31| I don't know if Mr. Smeltzer is still on the call here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14551)|
| 4:02:35| Mr. Smeltzer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14555)|
| 4:02:37| I'm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14557)|
| 4:02:38| It originally started at 72 hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14558)|
| 4:02:42| because that's the Baker Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14562)|
| 4:02:43| but I'll let Mr. Smeltzer comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14563)|
| 4:02:46| Yes, I'll give the simple answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14566)|
| 4:02:48| And then Leanne Human-Hillyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14568)|
| 4:02:50| our VP of Clinical Services is on as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14570)|
| 4:02:52| The short answer is prior to the state's funding cuts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14572)|
| 4:02:56| this program could allow for 72 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14576)|
| 4:02:59| And as we retooled the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14579)|
| 4:03:00| to allow for the new funding pattern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14580)|
| 4:03:03| a 24 hour stay plus a community-based program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14583)|
| 4:03:06| we call FACT is now in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14586)|
| 4:03:11| So Mr. Smeltzer, do we have enough beds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14591)|
| 4:03:15| or enough locations in the FACT program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14595)|
| 4:03:19| for folks to move on to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14599)|
| 4:03:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14601)|
| 4:03:22| In terms of capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14602)|
| 4:03:24| we have not turned anyone away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14604)|
| 4:03:25| from not having available bed space since the program began.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14605)|
| 4:03:29| And how many folks have you all served| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14609)|
| 4:03:34| since the program began?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14614)|
| 4:03:37| Actually, we provided the recorder, Will Johnson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14617)|
| 4:03:40| with a very short five slide presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14620)|
| 4:03:43| that has all the data for the program to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14623)|
| 4:03:47| And Leanne Human-Hillyard, as I said, is on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14627)|
| 4:03:50| She can unmute and kind of go through the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14630)|
| 4:03:53| But again, give a short answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14633)|
| 4:03:55| for the target number that we were projecting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14635)|
| 4:03:58| We were right on target| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14638)|
| 4:03:59| with the volume we were hoping to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14639)|
| 4:04:04| Mr. Smeltzer, do you want to just run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14644)|
| 4:04:05| through these real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14645)|
| 4:04:09| This is Leanne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14649)|
| 4:04:09| I'll defer to Leanne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14649)|
| 4:04:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14651)|
| 4:04:12| This is Leanne Human-Hillyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14652)|
| 4:04:13| Can you all hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14653)|
| 4:04:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14654)|
| 4:04:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14655)|
| 4:04:16| So I'll do this as briefly as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14656)|
| 4:04:18| Yes, we did retool the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14658)|
| 4:04:20| I will tell you that last year we served over 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14660)|
| 4:04:24| Year to date, we've served 373.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14664)|
| 4:04:27| So we are on track to get to that same 500 number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14667)|
| 4:04:31| And Houston is absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14671)|
| 4:04:33| So we retooled the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14673)|
| 4:04:34| to reduce the residential drop-off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14674)|
| 4:04:37| which is very, very critical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14677)|
| 4:04:38| But we did that to align with utilization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14678)|
| 4:04:41| that we had been seeing over the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14681)|
| 4:04:43| The other thing that we did was pull those resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14683)|
| 4:04:47| to provide for the community-based component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14687)|
| 4:04:51| which we call FACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14691)|
| 4:04:52| We really heard feedback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14692)|
| 4:04:56| that while our outcomes looked good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14696)|
| 4:04:59| for engaging individuals into their first appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14699)|
| 4:05:04| with outpatient providers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14704)|
| 4:05:06| we didn't have a step beyond that for this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14706)|
| 4:05:10| So that's what was created with the FACT program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14710)|
| 4:05:14| And it's really the focus for FACT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14714)|
| 4:05:17| was housing and employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14717)|
| 4:05:20| treatment, engagement, and stabilization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14720)|
| 4:05:23| So you can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14723)|
| 4:05:24| If you wanna look at this slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14724)|
| 4:05:26| 44% of the individuals were served through the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14726)|
| 4:05:30| can you go back to the other one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14730)|
| 4:05:33| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14733)|
| 4:05:34| 44% of the individuals were provided services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14734)|
| 4:05:38| with the drop-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14738)|
| 4:05:39| And I'll just, as a reminder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14739)|
| 4:05:41| because someone spoke earlier about services in Seattle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14741)|
| 4:05:44| that they provide for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14744)|
| 4:05:46| We do very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14746)|
| 4:05:47| This is pre-booking, upon arrest, low-level misdemeanor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14747)|
| 4:05:51| They, if they don't come to our program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14751)|
| 4:05:53| they are going to jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14753)|
| 4:05:55| So 44% of the individuals went to the drop-off center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14755)|
| 4:05:58| And then 49 actually went to the drop-off center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14758)|
| 4:06:03| and the Community FACT program in addition to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14763)|
| 4:06:06| 8% came through a different avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14766)|
| 4:06:09| Very small numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14769)|
| 4:06:10| but most of those are coming directly through Avenue B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14770)|
| 4:06:13| which is through jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14773)|
| 4:06:15| If you wanna,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14775)|
| 4:06:16| would you all like to go through all of these quickly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14776)|
| 4:06:21| Okay, so it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14781)|
| 4:06:22| Okay, so it's important to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14782)|
| 4:06:24| that the majority of the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14784)|
| 4:06:25| that we see are uninsured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14785)|
| 4:06:28| and that the population is over 50%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14788)|
| 4:06:33| are reporting homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14793)|
| 4:06:36| You wanna go to the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14796)|
| 4:06:37| We're very proud of this outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14797)|
| 4:06:39| So for individuals that come to the drop-off center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14799)|
| 4:06:42| we wanted to make sure that we not only engage them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14802)|
| 4:06:45| in an outpatient treatment appointment anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14805)|
| 4:06:47| not just for McNabb, wherever they chose to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14807)|
| 4:06:50| we wanted to make sure that appointment was kept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14810)|
| 4:06:52| and they showed up to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14812)|
| 4:06:54| So we see a 68% success of our individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14814)|
| 4:06:57| who actually make that appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14817)|
| 4:07:00| When you look at a benchmark for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14820)|
| 4:07:03| what we found was 35% is the benchmark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14823)|
| 4:07:07| for the state of Tennessee's goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14827)|
| 4:07:09| For a similar population, not just exact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14829)|
| 4:07:12| it's for inpatient post-discharge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14832)|
| 4:07:14| to outpatient appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14834)|
| 4:07:16| So we're proud of that 68%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14836)|
| 4:07:19| Do you wanna go to the next one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14839)|
| 4:07:20| So this is important, I think, for you all and interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14840)|
| 4:07:24| So we want to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14844)|
| 4:07:26| this is outcomes for the community-based program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14846)|
| 4:07:30| We wanted to track housing and employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14850)|
| 4:07:33| What you see from this slide are individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14853)|
| 4:07:36| that upon admission, 33% are reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14856)|
| 4:07:42| that they are housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14862)|
| 4:07:44| Within 30 days, if they're in this quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14864)|
| 4:07:47| this is a quarterly report, within 30 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14867)|
| 4:07:51| the individuals in the FACT program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14871)|
| 4:07:53| who have been in the program 30 days show an 88% housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14873)|
| 4:07:56| If they are in the program for up to 90 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14876)|
| 4:08:00| they're 100% housed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14880)|
| 4:08:02| So when I look at that graph, what it tells me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14882)|
| 4:08:05| is that the staff are very focused on housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14885)|
| 4:08:09| within the first 30 days for individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14889)|
| 4:08:12| in the FACT program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14892)|
| 4:08:15| Employment looks very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14895)|
| 4:08:18| These are for individuals who are in need of employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14898)|
| 4:08:22| to establish an income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14902)|
| 4:08:23| At admission, we have 19%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14903)|
| 4:08:26| 30 days, very similar to our housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14906)|
| 4:08:28| We see an 82% of employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14908)|
| 4:08:31| It doesn't include individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14911)|
| 4:08:33| who receive disability benefits, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14913)|
| 4:08:36| that we remove them from that measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14916)|
| 4:08:40| And the final report is what we look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14920)|
| 4:08:43| from data through Knox County, we get arrest data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14923)|
| 4:08:47| and we want to see if six months post-admission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14927)|
| 4:08:51| to the program, did the individual return to jail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14931)|
| 4:08:56| And we are looking at a 48% success rate of individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14936)|
| 4:09:01| with no additional jail stays six months post-admission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14941)|
| 4:09:05| The benchmark for that, the closest thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14945)|
| 4:09:07| that we could find, because this is very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14947)|
| 4:09:10| this program is very innovative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14950)|
| 4:09:14| So there's the closest benchmark we could find to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14954)|
| 4:09:17| was where 68% of incarcerated individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14957)|
| 4:09:19| with substance use disorders return to jail upon release.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14959)|
| 4:09:23| So this is our third quarter report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14963)|
| 4:09:25| We'll have one at the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14965)|
| 4:09:28| but every quarter looks very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14968)|
| 4:09:30| We don't have a lot of swings in the reporting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14970)|
| 4:09:33| that we get quarter to quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14973)|
| 4:09:36| And I'll be happy to answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14976)|
| 4:09:39| or talk to you about any changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14979)|
| 4:09:40| that we've made for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14980)|
| 4:09:43| Thank you, Ms. Hilliard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14983)|
| 4:09:44| Any questions for Ms. Hilliard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14984)|
| 4:09:48| Ms. Singh, are you raising your hand or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14988)|
| 4:09:50| I am, yes, I'm in the dark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14990)|
| 4:09:52| Maybe you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14992)|
| 4:09:53| Yes, I had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14993)|
| 4:09:57| The FACT program is what is out in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=14997)|
| 4:10:02| is that working with the homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15002)|
| 4:10:06| going into the community there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15006)|
| 4:10:08| Absolutely, I appreciate the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15008)|
| 4:10:11| So the FACT program, when we wanted to develop that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15011)|
| 4:10:16| we wanted to find a model that we knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15016)|
| 4:10:18| that we could go out into the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15018)|
| 4:10:20| meet people where they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15020)|
| 4:10:22| because that's the best way we're gonna know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15022)|
| 4:10:24| how to help an individual in their own environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15024)|
| 4:10:27| And so the services would be very intensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15027)|
| 4:10:30| very frequent touch points with that individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15030)|
| 4:10:33| whether they're in a home or in the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15033)|
| 4:10:36| or wherever they may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15036)|
| 4:10:38| with the goal of making sure we first get basic needs met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15038)|
| 4:10:42| of course, and then work on the housing, employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15042)|
| 4:10:46| engaging in treatment, obtaining medications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15046)|
| 4:10:48| whether that means we need to take them to the pharmacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15048)|
| 4:10:52| take them to the grocery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15052)|
| 4:10:54| take them to their first appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15054)|
| 4:10:55| take them to get their medications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15055)|
| 4:10:58| And every single person that's in that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15058)|
| 4:11:02| has a unique treatment plan that we're working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15062)|
| 4:11:05| because everyone's very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15065)|
| 4:11:06| I will say that there is no other program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15066)|
| 4:11:09| that is that intensive in this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15069)|
| 4:11:11| for the uninsured population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15071)|
| 4:11:14| A very similar program is what we call PACT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15074)|
| 4:11:17| and that's for individuals that have insurance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15077)|
| 4:11:20| TennCare, with very strict criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15080)|
| 4:11:23| So I really feel like this is meeting a huge gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15083)|
| 4:11:26| for a very unique, hard-to-engage population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15086)|
| 4:11:30| Okay, I also have some questions about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15090)|
| 4:11:33| did you call it the drop-off center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15093)|
| 4:11:35| Be healthy. That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15095)|
| 4:11:37| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15097)|
| 4:11:37| So someone had mentioned to me that the cost was very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15097)|
| 4:11:43| They said about $3,000 for a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15103)|
| 4:11:47| And I wondered if that's correct, and if it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15107)|
| 4:11:51| how is that investment seen as the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15111)|
| 4:11:54| that it saves us down the road in emergency rooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15114)|
| 4:11:59| and all the other things that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15119)|
| 4:12:02| Sure, that's a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15122)|
| 4:12:03| And our CFO is on the line, too, if we need to pull him in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15123)|
| 4:12:06| but I hope I can answer this question that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15126)|
| 4:12:09| We, I don't have $3,000 a day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15129)|
| 4:12:12| so I don't know how that information's getting reported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15132)|
| 4:12:17| When we look at our data, we are seeing a cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15137)|
| 4:12:20| I'm trying to pull it up right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15140)|
| 4:12:22| about $32 to $33 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15142)|
| 4:12:26| So when you look at the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15146)|
| 4:12:29| what we're funding is a firehouse model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15149)|
| 4:12:32| for law enforcement to drop off 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15152)|
| 4:12:36| And then we have the FACT community-based component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15156)|
| 4:12:42| So when you look at how much funding we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15162)|
| 4:12:45| based on the number of individuals that we serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15165)|
| 4:12:50| through the BHUC, or through the drop-off component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15170)|
| 4:12:53| as well as the community-based program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15173)|
| 4:12:57| it averages about to $33 a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15177)|
| 4:13:02| So I think, it is a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15182)|
| 4:13:04| So if you have more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15184)|
| 4:13:09| on how you're getting to that other higher number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15189)|
| 4:13:12| I'd be happy to talk with you about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15192)|
| 4:13:14| and work through the numbers with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15194)|
| 4:13:16| Because I think there's a lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15196)|
| 4:13:18| the program is extremely complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15198)|
| 4:13:20| and there's a lot of pieces to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15200)|
| 4:13:22| And I think from our initial version of the original,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15202)|
| 4:13:26| just plain drop-off center with the beds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15206)|
| 4:13:30| it's not really a bed-day design any longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15210)|
| 4:13:32| once that funding from the state went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15212)|
| 4:13:41| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15221)|
| 4:13:44| And I just wanna commend this program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15224)|
| 4:13:47| and thank you for that presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15227)|
| 4:13:50| This is definitely what we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15230)|
| 4:13:53| and what we need more of to help people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15233)|
| 4:13:56| I just wanted to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15236)|
| 4:13:58| If I may have one more statement to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15238)|
| 4:14:01| I'd like to say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15241)|
| 4:14:02| I'd like to thank Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15242)|
| 4:14:05| Without them, we could not be as successful as we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15245)|
| 4:14:07| They've been amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15247)|
| 4:14:09| They make the majority of the referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15249)|
| 4:14:12| They've done an amazing job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15252)|
| 4:14:14| Of course, the Sheriff's Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15254)|
| 4:14:16| as well as the DA's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15256)|
| 4:14:18| And we meet regularly to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15258)|
| 4:14:19| We've got individuals from other states| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15259)|
| 4:14:21| reaching out to us to learn and model off our design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15261)|
| 4:14:25| We met today and there was an individual that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15265)|
| 4:14:29| a success story that we were looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15269)|
| 4:14:30| that for years was going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15270)|
| 4:14:33| and was being arrested 20 to 30 times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15273)|
| 4:14:36| And that individual, after the program has been doing well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15276)|
| 4:14:39| she was arrested three times last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15279)|
| 4:14:41| and so far this year, none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15281)|
| 4:14:43| So it is making a difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15283)|
| 4:14:45| and I appreciate all you all's support in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15285)|
| 4:14:48| And it makes us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15288)|
| 4:14:50| well, I think we're all doing a really great thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15290)|
| 4:14:52| for the citizens in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15292)|
| 4:14:57| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15297)|
| 4:14:58| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15298)|
| 4:15:01| Seeing none, please conduct a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15301)|
| 4:15:04| Councilwoman Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15304)|
| 4:15:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15307)|
| 4:15:09| Councilman DiBerto?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15309)|

| 4:19:29| It's really late and we're all tired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15569)|
| 4:19:33| but Mr. Green, I've had conversations with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15573)|
| 4:19:37| and several questions about this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15577)|
| 4:19:39| And I understand, I guess if you want to explain it briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15579)|
| 4:19:44| and then I'll ask some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15584)|
| 4:19:48| And one of the things when I spoke to you today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15588)|
| 4:19:51| is I obtusely, because I couldn't talk about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15591)|
| 4:19:55| referenced the appeal we had a while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15595)|
| 4:19:57| And I know everybody saw how we struggled with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15597)|
| 4:20:00| I feel like there's some things about that appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15600)|
| 4:20:04| that tie to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15604)|
| 4:20:06| And to me, it takes all these decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15606)|
| 4:20:10| out of any public light and puts them in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15610)|
| 4:20:13| that the public has not noticed that decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15613)|
| 4:20:15| are being made and that's where I struggle with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15615)|
| 4:20:17| So I would rather find a way to not delay development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15617)|
| 4:20:22| but to make sure the public is aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15622)|
| 4:20:24| that development is occurring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15624)|

| 4:20:41| The standards were written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15641)|
| 4:20:43| Previously, the standards were not known.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15643)|
| 4:20:45| Developers came into this community and planned districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15645)|
| 4:20:49| with no idea of what standards would be imposed on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15649)|
| 4:20:52| The community could ask for things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15652)|
| 4:20:53| never knowing exactly what their grounds for asking were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15653)|
| 4:20:58| In the five years I've been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15658)|
| 4:21:00| four and a half years of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15660)|
| 4:21:02| we dealt with planned districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15662)|
| 4:21:04| Never were there public comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15664)|
| 4:21:06| on any of the projects we've received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15666)|
| 4:21:08| Most of them were approved by consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15668)|
| 4:21:10| based on planners' perception of what was required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15670)|
| 4:21:14| Some of the older ones did have community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15674)|
| 4:21:18| What we're doing is going to an objective-based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15678)|
| 4:21:22| plan approval process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15682)|
| 4:21:24| where everyone in the same district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15684)|
| 4:21:27| is subject to the same standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15687)|
| 4:21:29| not a piecemeal approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15689)|
| 4:21:31| subjective that would take up to four months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15691)|
| 4:21:34| for approval for a small project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15694)|
| 4:21:36| in a previously planned district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15696)|
| 4:21:41| Okay, Ms. Leiser?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15701)|
| 4:21:45| I'll let Mr. Roberto ask a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15705)|
| 4:21:48| while I find my notes that I have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15708)|
| 4:21:51| Okay, Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15711)|
| 4:21:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15713)|
| 4:21:57| I guess a little bit more detailed history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15717)|
| 4:22:00| I think, is good here to walk through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15720)|
| 4:22:03| And I agree, it's late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15723)|
| 4:22:07| so everyone wants to talk about zoning right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15727)|
| 4:22:10| and I know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15730)|
| 4:22:12| Basically, what we're talking about here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15732)|
| 4:22:14| is former planned developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15734)|
| 4:22:16| that were in the former zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15736)|
| 4:22:20| as PC1, PC2, SC1, SC2, SC3, I1, B, P1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15740)|
| 4:22:27| and those are being brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15747)|
| 4:22:28| into the current zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15748)|
| 4:22:30| via the transition rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15750)|
| 4:22:32| which this amends in section 1.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15752)|
| 4:22:36| These previous planned zone districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15756)|
| 4:22:38| went through a rezoning to the planned district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15758)|
| 4:22:41| and then they also went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15761)|
| 4:22:42| a use on review development plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15762)|
| 4:22:46| and that plan would have a lot of detail in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15766)|
| 4:22:49| Use, uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15769)|
| 4:22:53| what you could do with temporary outdoor displays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15773)|
| 4:22:56| where your garbage is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15776)|
| 4:22:58| where your loading dock's going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15778)|
| 4:23:01| and it would assure that the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15781)|
| 4:23:03| was something that would be aesthetically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15783)|
| 4:23:07| acceptable for that specific area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15787)|
| 4:23:11| This amendment releases these developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15791)|
| 4:23:14| from that preexisting development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15794)|
| 4:23:18| as well as from the public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15798)|
| 4:23:21| that was going on to review it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15801)|
| 4:23:24| for past, like we talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15804)|
| 4:23:26| or future development plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15806)|
| 4:23:30| The CG2, CR2, and CG3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15810)|
| 4:23:36| all have permitted uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15816)|
| 4:23:37| and I've had a lot of discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15817)|
| 4:23:40| with Director Green about this as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15820)|
| 4:23:44| and those do contain design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15824)|
| 4:23:46| and he'll probably talk to you about that here in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15826)|
| 4:23:50| but what they lack is a public process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15830)|
| 4:23:52| that used to be, that used to exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15832)|
| 4:23:57| That process does not need to be overly burdensome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15837)|
| 4:24:00| and I would recommend it not be overly burdensome at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15840)|
| 4:24:03| but I think leaving an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15843)|
| 4:24:05| for the public to participate is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15845)|
| 4:24:08| This debate that we're going to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15848)|
| 4:24:10| is really not about preserving a plan that is outdated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15850)|
| 4:24:14| because some of these plans could be 15, 20 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15854)|
| 4:24:17| and I think it would be easy to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15857)|
| 4:24:19| that some of those probably need some updates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15859)|
| 4:24:23| but it is about protecting a public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15863)|
| 4:24:27| and the public process was set up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15867)|
| 4:24:30| because the thought was that these types of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15870)|
| 4:24:34| would be sensitive to surrounding areas around them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15874)|
| 4:24:40| I like the goal of what is trying to be done here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15880)|
| 4:24:43| which is about providing flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15883)|
| 4:24:46| It's not, you know, again, it's not about trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15886)|
| 4:24:48| to lock people into plans that are 20 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15888)|
| 4:24:51| but I'd like to, and I talked to Director Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15891)|
| 4:24:54| about this too, I'd like to try to preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15894)|
| 4:24:57| some way of a public process in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15897)|
| 4:25:02| and unfortunately, that's not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15902)|
| 4:25:06| and that's really what was done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15906)|
| 4:25:08| in the previous zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15908)|
| 4:25:13| So the idea is not, it is to provide flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15913)|
| 4:25:16| but then not to remove the public process that was in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15916)|
| 4:25:22| There is examples of these, you know, all over the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15922)|
| 4:25:25| so it's not just in any one district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15925)|
| 4:25:31| That's where I struggle with this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15931)|
| 4:25:33| and I'm sure if I misstated something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15933)|
| 4:25:36| Director Green will let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15936)|
| 4:25:38| Council Member Roberto, I think you made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15938)|
| 4:25:42| some very good points, and I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15942)|
| 4:25:46| I think looking back at the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15946)|
| 4:25:47| the reason that the plan districts were put in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15947)|
| 4:25:52| was because our standards overall were so lacking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15952)|
| 4:25:55| These areas were identified as places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15955)|
| 4:25:57| where additional review was needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15957)|
| 4:26:00| With the new zoning ordinance, we're picking the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15960)|
| 4:26:04| that were commonly placed on development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15964)|
| 4:26:07| in the plan districts, the design standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15967)|
| 4:26:11| the architectural design, the pedestrian access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15971)|
| 4:26:13| the landscaping, the lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15973)|
| 4:26:16| the restriction on temporary uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15976)|
| 4:26:19| restrictions on outdoor entertainment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15979)|
| 4:26:21| They're all a standard part of the zoning ordinance now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15981)|
| 4:26:24| and especially in the CR2, the CH2, the CG2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15984)|
| 4:26:28| the CG3 zones for those enhanced design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15988)|
| 4:26:31| and even material limitations are embedded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15991)|
| 4:26:35| So we have those protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15995)|
| 4:26:37| We do not have the public process on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=15997)|
| 4:26:41| We had a public process when these standards were vetted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16001)|
| 4:26:44| when the zoning ordinance was vetted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16004)|
| 4:26:47| What we've done, as I've stated before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16007)|
| 4:26:49| overall is to raise the bar for development standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16009)|
| 4:26:52| and in exchange for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16012)|
| 4:26:55| we've made the process a bit easier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16015)|
| 4:26:58| and I think that we've reached a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16018)|
| 4:27:01| You spoke about a compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16021)|
| 4:27:03| I think we've reached a great compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16023)|
| 4:27:05| where we upgraded the standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16025)|
| 4:27:07| made the standards much better than under the old ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16027)|
| 4:27:12| and made them uniform and objective for all districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16032)|
| 4:27:17| We made them easier to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16037)|
| 4:27:19| Council Member Ryder asked me a good question today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16039)|
| 4:27:22| that, you know, these plan districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16042)|
| 4:27:24| they were supposed to have restricted covenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16044)|
| 4:27:27| Well, I guess they have them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16047)|
| 4:27:30| I've never seen them with any of the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16050)|
| 4:27:33| that have come for the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16053)|
| 4:27:36| since I've been here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16056)|
| 4:27:37| It's always a condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16057)|
| 4:27:39| whether it's actually complied with or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16059)|
| 4:27:42| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16062)|
| 4:27:43| I've never seen them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16063)|
| 4:27:44| If you ask me where they were for any development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16064)|
| 4:27:47| I couldn't, I would not be able to find them easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16067)|
| 4:27:50| I can't get them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16070)|
| 4:27:52| They may be in the city somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16072)|
| 4:27:54| I'm not sure that the city, as a governmental entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16074)|
| 4:27:58| is enforcing restricted covenants on a private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16078)|
| 4:28:03| I think that's, I'm not quite,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16083)|
| 4:28:05| I'd have to defer to Mr. Swanson on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16085)|
| 4:28:09| but I think there are several challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16089)|
| 4:28:12| in the old zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16092)|
| 4:28:14| that we overcame with the new zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16094)|
| 4:28:16| And a lot of those challenges resulted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16096)|
| 4:28:19| in the creation of the plan districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16099)|
| 4:28:21| and a case-by-case review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16101)|
| 4:28:23| which is not an efficient way to review development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16103)|
| 4:28:26| and to allow good development to occur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16106)|
| 4:28:28| in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16108)|
| 4:28:33| Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16113)|
| 4:28:35| So, Mr. Green, I agree with you that we obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16115)|
| 4:28:38| I mean, I stuck it out till one o'clock in the morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16118)|
| 4:28:40| some nights for us to go line by line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16120)|
| 4:28:43| that we have a better zoning code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16123)|
| 4:28:46| and we have higher standards now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16126)|
| 4:28:49| Included in that line-by-line review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16129)|
| 4:28:51| was this transition rule that we're asking to remove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16131)|
| 4:28:56| And I went through one of the plan developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16136)|
| 4:29:02| not in my district, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16142)|
| 4:29:03| because it's just one that rose to the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16143)|
| 4:29:04| and was easy to remember and find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16144)|
| 4:29:07| was the Kroger in Fountain City,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16147)|
| 4:29:08| which is technically in the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16148)|
| 4:29:11| And you and I went through it, talked about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16151)|
| 4:29:14| and the new code might actually end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16154)|
| 4:29:18| with more landscaping and more walkability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16158)|
| 4:29:22| and better pedestrian access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16162)|
| 4:29:23| And one of the things that came from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16163)|
| 4:29:25| Fountain City Connections being involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16165)|
| 4:29:26| in those negotiations was a CAT bus stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16166)|
| 4:29:30| that Kroger paid for as part of that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16170)|
| 4:29:34| You know, the public was involved in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16174)|
| 4:29:37| And one of the things that I presented to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16177)|
| 4:29:41| and I talked to developers about this today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16181)|
| 4:29:45| is, you know, there are a lot of people in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16185)|
| 4:29:49| that have had a lot of vested interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16189)|
| 4:29:51| in the shopping centers that need to be developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16191)|
| 4:29:54| along Broadway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16194)|
| 4:29:56| And if all of a sudden those were, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16196)|
| 4:29:59| just like with what's going on with Estes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16199)|
| 4:30:01| if it's already planned, the development is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16201)|
| 4:30:06| and you find out because the tractors are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16206)|
| 4:30:09| that's the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16209)|
| 4:30:10| The public doesn't even know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16210)|
| 4:30:11| I addressed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16211)|
| 4:30:13| And your argument was that development is easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16213)|
| 4:30:16| and making development harder is not gonna make it happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16216)|
| 4:30:19| versus not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16219)|
| 4:30:20| And I agree with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16220)|
| 4:30:22| But, you know, I asked Mr. Ahrens and if folks remember,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16222)|
| 4:30:25| I asked in the budget hearing last week about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16225)|
| 4:30:29| in Nashville, you know, when development's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16229)|
| 4:30:32| it's available online the minute the process starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16232)|
| 4:30:36| so the public will know that something's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16236)|
| 4:30:39| that a development's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16239)|
| 4:30:42| Mr. Ahrens, I asked him about that again today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16242)|
| 4:30:44| and he says his hope is that that software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16244)|
| 4:30:47| and that will happen in about 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16247)|
| 4:30:50| If all goes well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16250)|
| 4:30:52| I just think the public needs to know, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16252)|
| 4:30:56| the changes that are coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16256)|
| 4:30:57| especially when sometimes they've put hours and hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16257)|
| 4:31:00| of time into things and it might result in something like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16260)|
| 4:31:04| you know, an amenity like a bus stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16264)|
| 4:31:07| that might not rise out of the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16267)|
| 4:31:10| and is not gonna rise out of the design guidelines per se| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16270)|
| 4:31:14| that are in the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16274)|
| 4:31:15| And that's all if, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16275)|
| 4:31:19| the public seat at the table or even be aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16279)|
| 4:31:21| and one of the developers pointed at me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16281)|
| 4:31:22| and then I'll be quiet and let somebody else speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16282)|
| 4:31:25| is, you know, downtown is already built and established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16285)|
| 4:31:29| but there's a downtown design review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16289)|
| 4:31:32| Cumberland has a review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16292)|
| 4:31:34| There's public notice process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16294)|
| 4:31:36| And that's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16296)|
| 4:31:37| And when you discuss this at the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16297)|
| 4:31:41| I'm not trying to disagree about the better standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16301)|
| 4:31:44| that we came up with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16304)|
| 4:31:45| it's just the public notice component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16305)|
| 4:31:46| has given me a lot of heartache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16306)|
| 4:31:50| And sorry, I lost my track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16310)|
| 4:31:56| Yeah, anyway, I'll leave it at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16316)|
| 4:31:59| before I start rambling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16319)|
| 4:32:01| Ms. Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16321)|
| 4:32:01| Okay, and I can understand your concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16321)|
| 4:32:04| about public involvement, that we need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16324)|
| 4:32:08| And we'll, we have a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16328)|
| 4:32:11| Planning has a great webmaster and a website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16331)|
| 4:32:14| where you can work with Mr. Aarons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16334)|
| 4:32:16| and see if we can make that process for public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16336)|
| 4:32:19| I know we have our development activity report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16339)|
| 4:32:22| and other things that may be able to enhance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16342)|
| 4:32:25| With regard to the bus stops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16345)|
| 4:32:26| there is a provision in the parking ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16346)|
| 4:32:29| that allows developers to take a reduction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16349)|
| 4:32:33| in their parking if they're within a quarter mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16353)|
| 4:32:36| of a transit route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16356)|
| 4:32:38| And there could be a requirement that they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16358)|
| 4:32:41| the staff could require a transit stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16361)|
| 4:32:45| be part of the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16365)|
| 4:32:47| if they're within a quarter mile of a transit route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16367)|
| 4:32:49| and take that parking reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16369)|
| 4:32:51| So we are trying to address those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16371)|
| 4:32:53| all those concerns that were identified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16373)|
| 4:32:56| in the old plan districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16376)|
| 4:32:58| And again, I'll talk to our webmaster tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16378)|
| 4:33:01| and work with Mr. Aarons and see if there is a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16381)|
| 4:33:04| we can speed up the process of providing notification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16384)|
| 4:33:07| pending development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16387)|
| 4:33:09| Okay, so real quick, my last thoughts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16389)|
| 4:33:11| I'm sorry, Ms. Testerman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16391)|
| 4:33:13| is that you had said in the agenda review meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16393)|
| 4:33:16| that there's something about a second amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16396)|
| 4:33:19| that you had discussed the possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16399)|
| 4:33:21| of a special use review or plan development in lieu of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16401)|
| 4:33:27| and then those thoughts didn't move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16407)|
| 4:33:31| past your discussion that the agenda review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16411)|
| 4:33:34| So, and the point of that public notice, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16414)|
| 4:33:42| In the first draft that we had before this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16422)|
| 4:33:46| before the planning commission was headed as a special use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16426)|
| 4:33:50| but we realized a special use review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16430)|
| 4:33:53| but we realized that would not provide the flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16433)|
| 4:33:56| that would be needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16436)|
| 4:33:57| particularly with residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16437)|
| 4:33:59| So it was amended back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16439)|
| 4:34:01| It went from plan development in the adopted ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16441)|
| 4:34:07| to special use in the first draft| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16447)|
| 4:34:09| before the planning commission and revised draft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16449)|
| 4:34:11| put it back to plan development, wording plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16451)|
| 4:34:14| And the draft that had special use would apply only to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16454)|
| 4:34:19| again, it had accepted the non-residential districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16459)|
| 4:34:22| and would apply only to residential districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16462)|
| 4:34:25| We felt those districts, because of the desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16465)|
| 4:34:28| to maybe protect steep slopes on a development site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16468)|
| 4:34:33| might require more flexibility that would be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16473)|
| 4:34:37| through the plan development process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16477)|
| 4:34:42| Thank you, director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16482)|
| 4:34:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16483)|
| 4:34:46| I think we're ready to go to Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16486)|
| 4:34:49| Did you have more that you had to say right now, Mr. Green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16489)|
| 4:34:53| No, I'm fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16493)|
| 4:34:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16494)|
| 4:34:54| Thank you, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16494)|
| 4:34:56| Mr. Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16496)|
| 4:35:03| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16503)|
| 4:35:04| So if I could go to the conversation, Mr. Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16504)|
| 4:35:08| that we had, and sounds like a little bit similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16508)|
| 4:35:11| to councilwoman Ryder's conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16511)|
| 4:35:13| except we discussed the Kroger, Cedar Bluff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16513)|
| 4:35:17| and Kingston Pike, that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16517)|
| 4:35:21| But as I understand it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16521)|
| 4:35:24| we have raised the bar on the standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16524)|
| 4:35:28| traffic flow, landscape, pedestrian access, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16528)|
| 4:35:34| But in a development like that, there is a master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16534)|
| 4:35:39| And as we talked about, you may have these out parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16539)|
| 4:35:45| that on the master plan are represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16545)|
| 4:35:48| say, as a fast food restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16548)|
| 4:35:50| Well, that fast food restaurant, instead of fast food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16550)|
| 4:35:54| it becomes a Verizon store or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16554)|
| 4:35:56| But as long as it stays within the footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16556)|
| 4:36:01| of that master plan, then it still maintains the standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16561)|
| 4:36:07| that were established at the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16567)|
| 4:36:10| Are you following me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16570)|
| 4:36:11| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16571)|
| 4:36:14| So I guess my point, but let's say that that out parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16574)|
| 4:36:18| then kind of changes the integrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16578)|
| 4:36:21| or it increases square footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16581)|
| 4:36:23| or then it goes back through a review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16583)|
| 4:36:28| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16588)|
| 4:36:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16590)|
| 4:36:30| And under the current ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16590)|
| 4:36:31| that review process would take about four months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16591)|
| 4:36:34| It would involve two hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16594)|
| 4:36:37| before the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16597)|
| 4:36:38| and one approval and hearing for the city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16598)|
| 4:36:42| But if you've got an out parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16602)|
| 4:36:43| that's really just essentially keeping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16603)|
| 4:36:47| with the character of the master plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16607)|
| 4:36:51| of what was originally approved, the design process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16611)|
| 4:36:56| then I guess in my point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16616)|
| 4:37:00| we've got to be able to expedite that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16620)|
| 4:37:04| as we're trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16624)|
| 4:37:06| if you're really keeping within the confines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16626)|
| 4:37:09| and the character of what was originally established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16629)|
| 4:37:12| and went through the review on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16632)|
| 4:37:16| I think, so I'm trying to, you know, identify that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16636)|
| 4:37:23| and then what occurrences within that scope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16643)|
| 4:37:28| would have to change in order for it then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16648)|
| 4:37:30| to go back through the public process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16650)|
| 4:37:35| If it increased in square footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16655)|
| 4:37:39| if it went from a drive-thru with drive-thru lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16659)|
| 4:37:42| to a basic retail operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16662)|
| 4:37:46| if the, even if the location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16666)|
| 4:37:51| the exact location of the building changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16671)|
| 4:37:55| that would change in parking, traffic flow, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16675)|
| 4:37:59| would require it to go through the review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16679)|
| 4:38:05| But then if that didn't happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16685)|
| 4:38:09| then that's when, we're trying to expedite the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16689)|
| 4:38:13| if it's staying consistent with the original master plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16693)|
| 4:38:18| Am I communicating that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16698)|
| 4:38:22| Yes, and we're doing a bit there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16702)|
| 4:38:24| even if it changes from the master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16704)|
| 4:38:28| the ordinance would allow it to be reviewed by staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16708)|
| 4:38:31| if it met the standards of the zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16711)|
| 4:38:35| But because we've elevated those standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16715)|
| 4:38:39| we're not having, I guess, a level of confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16719)|
| 4:38:43| in what's been redefined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16723)|
| 4:38:48| I think that's correct, that level of confidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16728)|
| 4:38:50| And you stated it well, having a level of confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16730)|
| 4:38:54| in the standards that have been adopted by the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16734)|
| 4:38:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16739)|
| 4:39:00| Sorry, that was long-winded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16740)|
| 4:39:02| No, not, no, it's-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16742)|
| 4:39:05| Council members, there's not, is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16745)|
| 4:39:10| I don't think there's a motion, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16750)|
| 4:39:12| No, ma'am, we don't have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16752)|
| 4:39:13| Okay, is there any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16753)|
| 4:39:18| Is there, I'm sorry, does someone wanna make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16758)|
| 4:39:22| Councilwoman Rodgers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16762)|
| 4:39:23| I'm willing to move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16763)|
| 4:39:25| Okay, motion made by Councilwoman Testament to approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16765)|
| 4:39:27| is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16767)|
| 4:39:28| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16768)|
| 4:39:30| Seconded by Councilwoman Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16770)|
| 4:39:32| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16772)|
| 4:39:34| Ms. Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16774)|
| 4:39:37| Green, whoops, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16777)|
| 4:39:40| So if someone has a development like the Kroger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16780)|
| 4:39:45| at Cedar Bluff, and apparently somebody wants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16785)|
| 4:39:48| to change something that's not in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16788)|
| 4:39:50| that's not fitting with the plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16790)|
| 4:39:53| So I'm trying to follow along here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16793)|
| 4:39:58| So the answer is for us to remove this transition rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16798)|
| 4:40:02| so that they can move forward with the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16802)|
| 4:40:06| that we had under recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16806)|
| 4:40:10| Is that what's up in the air?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16810)|
| 4:40:12| Is that what the need is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16812)|
| 4:40:14| Yeah, the zoning under the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16814)|
| 4:40:16| zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16816)|
| 4:40:18| Right, so if we approve this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16818)|
| 4:40:20| then they can go forward and do a development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16820)|
| 4:40:23| or something that doesn't meet the before agreed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16823)|
| 4:40:29| plan development, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16829)|
| 4:40:32| The, in this particular case, the I-parcel was not shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16832)|
| 4:40:36| on the master plan, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16836)|
| 4:40:41| Right, so they can't meet the plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16841)|
| 4:40:43| So in order to do it, we have to change the transition rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16843)|
| 4:40:47| so the plan development doesn't apply anymore, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16847)|
| 4:40:52| And again, the I-parcel wasn't shown as developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16852)|
| 4:40:55| on the original plan, so it would be an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16855)|
| 4:40:59| And by changing the transition rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16859)|
| 4:41:02| we would enable them to have staff review for compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16862)|
| 4:41:07| with the zoning standards as they exist currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16867)|
| 4:41:13| If we do not change the transition rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16873)|
| 4:41:15| they go through the plan development review processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16875)|
| 4:41:17| which is a very.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16877)|
| 4:41:18| Which is lengthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16878)|
| 4:41:21| Then city council and then back to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16881)|
| 4:41:25| So, and then we'd likely would end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16885)|
| 4:41:28| with the same project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16888)|
| 4:41:31| It's just the route they take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16891)|
| 4:41:34| Right, it's just following the laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16894)|
| 4:41:35| So, could they ask for a rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16895)|
| 4:41:38| I mean, because in essence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16898)|
| 4:41:38| what we're doing is giving them a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16898)|
| 4:41:44| No, we're changing the review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16904)|
| 4:41:47| They could ask for a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16907)|
| 4:41:48| to have the plan development overlay removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16908)|
| 4:41:51| That would decrease their review period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16911)|
| 4:41:54| Well, they'd ask for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16914)|
| 4:41:56| That's three months to get the rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16916)|
| 4:42:00| and then they'd have to submit their plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16920)|
| 4:42:02| following the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16922)|
| 4:42:03| So, again, it's about a four-month process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16923)|
| 4:42:06| for the rezoning or the plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16926)|
| 4:42:12| I just, I guess my hang-up is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16932)|
| 4:42:14| I think there was a reason that we kept this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16934)|
| 4:42:16| in the line-by-line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16936)|
| 4:42:18| So, I just, I can't support it without any amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16938)|
| 4:42:22| for some kind of public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16942)|
| 4:42:24| That's how I feel about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16944)|
| 4:42:27| And I'll take the blame for being in the original draft.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16947)|
| 4:42:31| We heard comments at our public meetings in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16951)|
| 4:42:36| with regard to planned residential districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16956)|
| 4:42:41| and the developments in those planned residential districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16961)|
| 4:42:44| concerned about the original plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16964)|
| 4:42:49| And we addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16969)|
| 4:42:51| came up with a way to address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16971)|
| 4:42:52| and we extended it to all planned districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16972)|
| 4:42:55| and not thinking of the consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16975)|
| 4:42:57| on commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16977)|
| 4:42:59| And during the public meetings that I can recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16979)|
| 4:43:05| there were never any concerns expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16985)|
| 4:43:07| about planned commercial districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16987)|
| 4:43:09| and carrying those forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16989)|
| 4:43:13| I think every public meeting I've ever been to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16993)|
| 4:43:16| the public has wanted to be aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16996)|
| 4:43:19| of major developments going around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=16999)|
| 4:43:21| I mean, anyway, I can't support it as it stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17001)|
| 4:43:27| Oh, sorry, Ms. Ryder, I didn't mean to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17007)|
| 4:43:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17011)|
| 4:43:32| I'm just trying to understand what's going on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17012)|
| 4:43:36| because if this only applies to commercial, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17016)|
| 4:43:45| The proposed amendment would only remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17025)|
| 4:43:47| commercial zones from the planned development overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17027)|
| 4:43:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17031)|
| 4:43:55| And is this for anything new commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17035)|
| 4:44:01| or just a change from existing commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17041)|
| 4:44:07| Higher standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17047)|
| 4:44:09| It would apply to, I'll use an example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17049)|
| 4:44:13| the Westtown Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17053)|
| 4:44:16| Westtown Mall, and they've gone through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17056)|
| 4:44:18| quite a bit of change recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17058)|
| 4:44:21| but they wanted to delay-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17061)|
| 4:44:24| Yeah, I understand if you're making a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17064)|
| 4:44:28| to an existing development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17068)|
| 4:44:31| I think that's what I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17071)|
| 4:44:32| If a brand new development wants to take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17072)|
| 4:44:35| on undeveloped property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17075)|
| 4:44:37| doesn't that go through planning anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17077)|
| 4:44:41| and get all the approval?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17081)|
| 4:44:43| No, it goes through plans review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17083)|
| 4:44:45| If it's a base district and no variances are required,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17085)|
| 4:44:51| it would be reviewed by plans review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17091)|
| 4:44:53| and just staff-level administrative review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17093)|
| 4:44:56| for compliance with the standards in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17096)|
| 4:44:59| Just like always.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17099)|
| 4:45:01| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17101)|
| 4:45:09| Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17109)|
| 4:45:11| I have a question for Ms. Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17111)|
| 4:45:13| What do you mean by public process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17113)|
| 4:45:15| There's a difference to me between notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17115)|
| 4:45:18| that something's about to happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17118)|
| 4:45:20| and a community process to get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17120)|
| 4:45:24| I'm trying, because I've heard both words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17124)|
| 4:45:26| So if I own, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17126)|
| 4:45:31| I don't know that there's an approved plan on file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17131)|
| 4:45:36| for the Kroger down here at Woodland and Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17136)|
| 4:45:39| but let's pretend that there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17139)|
| 4:45:41| By removing this transition rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17141)|
| 4:45:43| we're null and voiding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17143)|
| 4:45:45| It doesn't exist anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17145)|
| 4:45:48| Let's look at the Kroger at Cedar Bluff, the whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17148)|
| 4:45:51| And the change that's being asked for may be minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17151)|
| 4:45:54| but the point is Fountain City Connections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17154)|
| 4:45:56| and other folks put lots of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17156)|
| 4:46:00| into negotiating with the developers to get things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17160)|
| 4:46:04| because we didn't use to have standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17164)|
| 4:46:06| We didn't use to require sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17166)|
| 4:46:07| We didn't use to require landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17167)|
| 4:46:09| And to Gerald's point, we do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17169)|
| 4:46:11| We went through line by line and did that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17171)|
| 4:46:12| but we also line by line protected those old agreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17172)|
| 4:46:16| So if you're going to remove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17176)|
| 4:46:17| and throw away those old agreements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17177)|
| 4:46:19| I feel the way to do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17179)|
| 4:46:21| is to make an amendment to this motion in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17181)|
| 4:46:24| And I don't want to tell Mr. Green or Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17184)|
| 4:46:27| Aarons what that amendment needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17187)|
| 4:46:28| because it's not my process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17188)|
| 4:46:30| I'm just saying that the community spent lots of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17190)|
| 4:46:36| negotiating for things as part of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17196)|
| 4:46:39| Now that agreement and that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17199)|
| 4:46:42| for them being publicly noticed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17202)|
| 4:46:43| when a change is going to happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17203)|
| 4:46:44| maybe they're cool with the ag parcel out in front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17204)|
| 4:46:47| at Cedar Bluff becoming something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17207)|
| 4:46:49| Maybe nobody cares, but they'll never know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17209)|
| 4:46:52| because you own it, we make this, we pass this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17212)|
| 4:46:56| They'll never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17216)|
| 4:46:57| It'll go down to Peter's guys at building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17217)|
| 4:47:00| They'll get their plans approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17220)|
| 4:47:01| just like the SD folks did, totally legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17221)|
| 4:47:04| And you'll find out after when the tractors are there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17224)|
| 4:47:06| and you'll go, wait a minute, we had a plan in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17226)|
| 4:47:09| for there never to be something with the driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17229)|
| 4:47:12| or for there to be a that there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17232)|
| 4:47:14| And so it's just taking the public notice part away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17234)|
| 4:47:16| Right. And so, and that's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17236)|
| 4:47:19| Notice to me is different than a big long process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17239)|
| 4:47:23| And I absolutely agree with you and feel you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17243)|
| 4:47:26| because it happened on my street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17246)|
| 4:47:28| that something got rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17248)|
| 4:47:29| and nobody in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17249)|
| 4:47:30| nobody on the street knew it was going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17250)|
| 4:47:32| It just happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17252)|
| 4:47:34| So understand what it's like not to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17254)|
| 4:47:37| something's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17257)|
| 4:47:38| And it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17258)|
| 4:47:40| And once the developers start spending their money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17260)|
| 4:47:42| but my question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17262)|
| 4:47:43| It's hard to tell them to stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17263)|
| 4:47:45| I know, but I also understand we hear a whole lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17265)|
| 4:47:49| about how hard it is to do business in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17269)|
| 4:47:53| So how do we fix this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17273)|
| 4:47:57| And if, you know, I don't have a magic answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17277)|
| 4:48:00| but I think they're not mutually exclusive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17280)|
| 4:48:05| but I do know developers need some degree of certainty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17285)|
| 4:48:12| and how long something's going to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17292)|
| 4:48:19| Which is why I called architects and developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17299)|
| 4:48:22| to have this conversation today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17302)|
| 4:48:25| So, and people were agreeing with me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17305)|
| 4:48:27| that there should be some public notice process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17307)|
| 4:48:31| and what I got from Mr. Aaron's is in 12 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17311)|
| 4:48:33| hopefully we'll have some software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17313)|
| 4:48:36| to make it publicly out there that something's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17316)|
| 4:48:41| And the other thing is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17321)|
| 4:48:42| I don't want to tell Mr. Aaron's staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17322)|
| 4:48:43| that they got to run around and go stake a sign out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17323)|
| 4:48:46| at Cedar Bluff and Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17326)|
| 4:48:49| The other answer is you buy an ad in the newspaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17329)|
| 4:48:51| which is part of the public notice process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17331)|
| 4:48:54| But an ad in the newspaper is not worth it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17334)|
| 4:49:00| That is not public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17340)|
| 4:49:03| So it's not my lack of confidence in the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17343)|
| 4:49:06| It's the people know after the tractor show up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17346)|
| 4:49:10| and the work is being done and maybe everything's cool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17350)|
| 4:49:14| And Gerald's point to me earlier today was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17354)|
| 4:49:18| is this worth it for the few times that it's not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17358)|
| 4:49:20| So those are just my feelings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17360)|
| 4:49:22| It's the public notice part that's giving me heartache.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17362)|
| 4:49:26| It's not, I don't want to delay people's projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17366)|
| 4:49:28| and I would like to find ways to fine tune the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17368)|
| 4:49:33| But here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17373)|
| 4:49:35| Is there a compromise either Director Aaron's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17375)|
| 4:49:39| or Director Green on presenting some type of public notice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17379)|
| 4:49:45| And I mean, just without going through public hearings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17385)|
| 4:49:50| I'm just trying to, because that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17390)|
| 4:49:55| I mean, nobody wants to do business in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17395)|
| 4:49:58| because it's, and I know that Director Aaron's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17398)|
| 4:50:02| has been working hard on, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17402)|
| 4:50:06| streamlining that process and making it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17406)|
| 4:50:08| the process much more user-friendly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17408)|
| 4:50:10| but we haven't, we've made it very difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17410)|
| 4:50:16| I know a lot of you are pained with me right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17416)|
| 4:50:19| but I'll just tack on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17419)|
| 4:50:20| No, I mean, it's all valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17420)|
| 4:50:22| I just, but before Mr. Green was around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17422)|
| 4:50:27| so going back with Mr. Massey in Office of Neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17427)|
| 4:50:31| and the previous MPC director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17431)|
| 4:50:34| there was a lot of conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17434)|
| 4:50:36| about adding to the application form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17436)|
| 4:50:38| And Mr. Green, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17438)|
| 4:50:40| it's obviously lost off my radar over time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17440)|
| 4:50:43| but there was a lot of conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17443)|
| 4:50:44| with Neighborhood Advisory Council, Mr. Massey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17444)|
| 4:50:48| and Mark Donaldson about checking the box with developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17448)|
| 4:50:53| Like, have you contacted the surrounding properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17453)|
| 4:50:56| and the surrounding community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17456)|
| 4:50:57| to the development you're about to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17457)|
| 4:51:00| It doesn't mean that the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17460)|
| 4:51:01| get to tell them what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17461)|
| 4:51:03| It's just building bridges and saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17463)|
| 4:51:06| hey, I'm here to follow the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17466)|
| 4:51:08| and I'm here to follow the codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17468)|
| 4:51:09| And just so you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17469)|
| 4:51:10| we're coming in and making things movement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17470)|
| 4:51:14| And maybe they say, you know what's really important to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17474)|
| 4:51:15| We want to make sure a bus stop goes in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17475)|
| 4:51:18| There's always been a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17478)|
| 4:51:19| about the Greenway coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17479)|
| 4:51:20| And Gerald and I talked about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17480)|
| 4:51:23| how the onus gets put on the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17483)|
| 4:51:24| and that those properties and parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17484)|
| 4:51:26| could be flagged for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17486)|
| 4:51:27| And I just don't feel that confident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17487)|
| 4:51:31| in making sure all the needs and wants of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17491)|
| 4:51:33| get brought up in that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17493)|
| 4:51:35| Planning does require, we have on our application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17495)|
| 4:51:41| a handout to all who make application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17501)|
| 4:51:45| for anything with us, a card advising them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17505)|
| 4:51:48| that they should contact the surrounding neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17508)|
| 4:51:52| let the community know what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17512)|
| 4:51:54| I'm still trying to think of a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17514)|
| 4:51:56| to provide public comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17516)|
| 4:52:00| And I'm not sure that we have a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17520)|
| 4:52:02| but I'm still trying to think of a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17522)|
| 4:52:03| to provide public notice of development that's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17523)|
| 4:52:07| And again, I'll work with Ms. Aarons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17527)|
| 4:52:09| to see what we can do working with our webmaster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17529)|
| 4:52:12| and our website to identify those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17532)|
| 4:52:16| on which building permit requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17536)|
| 4:52:19| or development requests have been received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17539)|
| 4:52:25| Council members, if it would help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17545)|
| 4:52:26| I mean, if you decide it would be better to postpone this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17546)|
| 4:52:33| we have Harold Cannon coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17553)|
| 4:52:35| as the new director of engineering in June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17555)|
| 4:52:38| and he could work with Mr. Aarons and Director Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17558)|
| 4:52:41| and some of the stakeholders you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17561)|
| 4:52:45| and maybe come up with some solutions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17565)|
| 4:52:49| that you think would be better for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17569)|
| 4:52:52| Is there any urgency on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17572)|
| 4:52:59| I'll let Mr. Aarons answer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17579)|
| 4:53:01| if he's still awake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17581)|
| 4:53:02| because he's the one who gets the development request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17582)|
| 4:53:08| There's Peter Aarons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17588)|
| 4:53:09| director of plans review and inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17589)|
| 4:53:13| There's always some level of urgency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17593)|
| 4:53:15| There's always a customer that's trying to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17595)|
| 4:53:18| and each time things are postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17598)|
| 4:53:21| it does have an impact on the customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17601)|
| 4:53:27| The one, obviously the one that I'm most aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17607)|
| 4:53:29| is the Kroger development out in Cedar Bluff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17609)|
| 4:53:34| where they're looking to try and move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17614)|
| 4:53:36| but they're not sure they're in limbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17616)|
| 4:53:42| So however urgent you feel that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17622)|
| 4:53:45| I guess that's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17625)|
| 4:53:51| How long would it take them if they had to file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17631)|
| 4:53:53| for a rezoning to get from underneath the plan development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17633)|
| 4:53:58| They would submit the end of this month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17638)|
| 4:54:01| for the July meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17641)|
| 4:54:02| It would go to city council in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17642)|
| 4:54:05| So they'd be, depending on the, they need two readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17645)|
| 4:54:10| So depending on the timing and the advertising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17650)|
| 4:54:13| it'd be late August, early September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17653)|
| 4:54:19| So if we could do something in June, that's faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17659)|
| 4:54:23| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17663)|
| 4:54:25| So is, I'm just, I'm so out of order here, Mayor Kincaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17665)|
| 4:54:31| I just apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17671)|
| 4:54:33| I'm just out of order and I know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17673)|
| 4:54:34| Go ahead, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17674)|
| 4:54:36| I'm just trying to work for a solution here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17676)|
| 4:54:38| So would it be amenable to sort of do what Mayor Kincaid says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17678)|
| 4:54:44| which is wait a month and be able to vote on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17684)|
| 4:54:49| in June that provides some semblance of a rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17689)|
| 4:54:53| and some semblance of notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17693)|
| 4:54:55| if that's what it's going to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17695)|
| 4:54:57| to have everybody be okay on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17697)|
| 4:54:59| I would prefer not a divided kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17699)|
| 4:55:04| I think it'd be better for the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17704)|
| 4:55:06| if we could come to some consensus that gives notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17706)|
| 4:55:12| but not a burdensome one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17712)|
| 4:55:15| And my experience with developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17715)|
| 4:55:17| is they'll do exactly what you ask them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17717)|
| 4:55:19| They just want to know what it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17719)|
| 4:55:21| and be assured that it's going to not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17721)|
| 4:55:28| I have no objection to that postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17728)|
| 4:55:30| from, you know, and we'll, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17730)|
| 4:55:33| ask all the appropriate people to help work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17733)|
| 4:55:38| Ms. Testerman would have to withdraw her motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17738)|
| 4:55:41| Other than that, we have to vote on her motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17741)|
| 4:55:44| Oh, we can vote on a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17744)|
| 4:55:45| Apparently that's a priority motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17745)|
| 4:55:48| I can make a motion to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17748)|
| 4:55:49| and that's priority motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17749)|
| 4:55:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17752)|
| 4:55:55| Mr. Swanson said so earlier tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17755)|
| 4:55:57| And I remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17757)|
| 4:55:58| Stephanie Welch wanted to speak to the, Stephanie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17758)|
| 4:56:06| I just, yes, thank you so much, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17766)|
| 4:56:08| Thank you, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17768)|
| 4:56:09| Just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17769)|
| 4:56:10| I just, I want to make sure if this motion changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17770)|
| 4:56:15| and passes that I understand what the request is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17775)|
| 4:56:19| Is council going to make a request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17779)|
| 4:56:23| that we have a public notice process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17783)|
| 4:56:27| for any development on commercial property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17787)|
| 4:56:33| What exactly are we noticing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17793)|
| 4:56:35| Under what circumstances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17795)|
| 4:56:37| So these are properties that had previous negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17797)|
| 4:56:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17802)|
| 4:56:43| Previous use on review properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17803)|
| 4:56:45| I asked Gerald, Director Green today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17805)|
| 4:56:48| how we would know how to find them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17808)|
| 4:56:51| There's no overlay to find them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17811)|
| 4:56:53| And so apparently they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17813)|
| 4:56:54| Mr. Aarons or Mr. Green can correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17814)|
| 4:56:57| I think they only come up as someone walks through the door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17817)|
| 4:57:00| and says, hey, I want to pull a permit to do XYZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17820)|
| 4:57:04| And then it's like, oh, you have a plan development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17824)|
| 4:57:08| and under the transition rule from the old code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17828)|
| 4:57:11| that means it goes through this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17831)|
| 4:57:15| It's just, I don't even know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17835)|
| 4:57:17| how many properties we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17837)|
| 4:57:19| And I don't know how easy it is to ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17839)|
| 4:57:21| but I'd rather postpone for two weeks to have an answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17841)|
| 4:57:24| It's just that people are expecting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17844)|
| 4:57:28| they negotiated certain things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17848)|
| 4:57:30| If you go back and you look and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17850)|
| 4:57:31| oh, they negotiated with sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17851)|
| 4:57:33| and now we require sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17853)|
| 4:57:34| then maybe this is a non-conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17854)|
| 4:57:38| So again, I'm just trying to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17858)|
| 4:57:40| So this would be public notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17860)|
| 4:57:42| for any property that is currently-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17862)|
| 4:57:46| That's affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17866)|
| 4:57:48| By this change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17868)|
| 4:57:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17869)|
| 4:57:50| When the developer...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17870)|
| 4:57:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17876)|
| 4:57:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17877)|
| 4:57:58| I think we'll try to come up with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17878)|
| 4:58:03| if that's what passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17883)|
| 4:58:04| I just wanted to make sure I understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17884)|
| 4:58:05| what the request was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17885)|
| 4:58:06| Thank you so much, council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17886)|
| 4:58:07| Thank you, mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17887)|
| 4:58:10| Thank you, Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17890)|
| 4:58:13| Right now there's a motion on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17893)|
| 4:58:15| but did you make the motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17895)|
| 4:58:17| I'm making a motion to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17897)|
| 4:58:22| for at least two weeks, for two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17902)|
| 4:58:28| and ask city staff and MPC to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17908)|
| 4:58:32| with something that addresses Ms. Ryder's point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17912)|
| 4:58:38| about public notice on plans that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17918)|
| 4:58:44| what do we call this, that had previous-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17924)|
| 4:58:47| Plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17927)|
| 4:58:48| Plan development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17928)|
| 4:58:49| If nothing else, a list of all of them would be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17929)|
| 4:58:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17934)|
| 4:58:55| So the motion on the floor is to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17935)|
| 4:58:57| for at least two weeks, or two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17937)|
| 4:59:01| and we can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17941)|
| 4:59:02| and is there a second to the motion to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17942)|
| 4:59:06| I'll second and withdraw my original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17946)|
| 4:59:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17949)|
| 4:59:09| Seconded by Councilwoman Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17949)|
| 4:59:11| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17951)|
| 4:59:15| Seeing none, please conduct a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17955)|

| 4:59:56| No public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17996)|
| 4:59:57| 12C is an ordinance to amend several articles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=17997)|
| 5:00:00| of the Knoxville City Code, appendix B, zoning code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18000)|
| 5:00:02| to correct drafting errors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18002)|
| 5:00:04| and to provide for additional clarity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18004)|

| 5:00:09| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18009)|
| 5:00:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18011)|
| 5:00:12| Motion made by Councilman Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18012)|
| 5:00:14| seconded by Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18014)|
| 5:00:17| Mr. Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18017)|
| 5:00:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18019)|
| 5:00:21| On this one, I do want to make a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18021)|
| 5:00:27| There was, the part that was giving me some difficulty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18027)|
| 5:00:32| on this one was the part about the drainage easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18032)|
| 5:00:35| and building decks and other things in a drainage easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18035)|
| 5:00:40| And I was concerned about potential exposure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18040)|
| 5:00:45| that the city might have with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18045)|
| 5:00:48| I've since had a very good conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18048)|
| 5:00:50| with the law department and Director Green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18050)|
| 5:00:53| and Director Aarons and Stephanie Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18053)|
| 5:00:59| So very good meeting on all those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18059)|
| 5:01:03| And I think some change language here would be good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18063)|
| 5:01:07| based on those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18067)|
| 5:01:09| And so what I'd like to do is propose an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18069)|
| 5:01:12| that article 10.1E, which is titled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18072)|
| 5:01:16| utility and drainage easements would read as follows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18076)|
| 5:01:20| Stormwater facilities, retaining walls and fences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18080)|
| 5:01:24| may be installed at the property owner's risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18084)|
| 5:01:28| subject to the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18088)|
| 5:01:30| of the city department of engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18090)|
| 5:01:34| And then as that's the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18094)|
| 5:01:40| I'd also like to extend the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18100)|
| 5:01:43| to do this one on emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18103)|
| 5:01:46| because I understand from those discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18106)|
| 5:01:48| that there are some urgent plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18108)|
| 5:01:53| with regard to the lighting subsection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18113)|
| 5:01:55| in this that need to get dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18115)|
| 5:01:58| And this was a part of a package that was going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18118)|
| 5:02:01| and we slowed it down to address this one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18121)|
| 5:02:05| So that would allow it to catch up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18125)|
| 5:02:07| with the other previously approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18127)|
| 5:02:10| that we finished out today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18130)|
| 5:02:16| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18136)|
| 5:02:18| It's two separate amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18138)|
| 5:02:19| Just take the first amendment first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18139)|
| 5:02:21| and then the second amendment in front of the emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18141)|
| 5:02:23| It's the easiest way to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18143)|
| 5:02:26| Okay, Mr. Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18146)|
| 5:02:27| can you separate the proposed amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18147)|
| 5:02:30| So if I need to restate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18150)|
| 5:02:33| I'll do the first amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18153)|
| 5:02:34| which is the change to the language first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18154)|
| 5:02:38| Does everybody understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18158)|
| 5:02:41| I had a question about the first amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18161)|
| 5:02:44| Okay, well, before we discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18164)|
| 5:02:46| is there even a second on this proposed amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18166)|
| 5:02:48| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18168)|
| 5:02:49| Okay, motion made to amend by Council Member Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18169)|
| 5:02:53| seconded by Councilwoman Huguette.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18173)|
| 5:02:55| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18175)|
| 5:02:57| Just to clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18177)|
| 5:02:58| so your amendment would remove decks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18178)|
| 5:03:04| as prohibited structures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18184)|
| 5:03:07| It removes the decks in that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18187)|
| 5:03:10| So it would now read that stormwater facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18190)|
| 5:03:13| retaining walls and fences may be installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18193)|
| 5:03:16| And then it adds the language at the property owner's risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18196)|
| 5:03:20| subject to the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18200)|
| 5:03:22| of the City Department of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18202)|
| 5:03:25| I may be looking at the wrong line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18205)|
| 5:03:27| Is it 10.1.E?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18207)|
| 5:03:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18210)|
| 5:03:33| Okay, I'm just reading that incorrectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18213)|
| 5:03:37| It seems like the way it reads decks are prohibited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18217)|
| 5:03:42| but if we take decks out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18222)|
| 5:03:44| then decks are allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18224)|
| 5:03:47| No?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18227)|
| 5:03:51| Mr. Ahrens, do you want to try to clarify that for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18231)|
| 5:03:57| Sure, I think what you're proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18237)|
| 5:03:59| again, Peter Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18239)|
| 5:04:00| Director of Plans Review and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18240)|
| 5:04:03| I think what you're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18243)|
| 5:04:04| is not just to remove some language from that section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18244)|
| 5:04:08| but to rewrite it such that we do allow landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18248)|
| 5:04:14| retaining walls, fences in those utility easements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18254)|
| 5:04:23| at the risk of the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18263)|
| 5:04:25| and subject to city engineering's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18265)|
| 5:04:29| And I think that's consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18269)|
| 5:04:32| with what we've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18272)|
| 5:04:35| It just wasn't written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18275)|
| 5:04:36| So we're trying to formalize a policy and practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18276)|
| 5:04:40| that's been in place for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18280)|
| 5:04:44| So to answer Council Member Parker's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18284)|
| 5:04:48| we're removing decks from that as an option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18288)|
| 5:04:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18291)|
| 5:04:52| We will not allow decks to be installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18292)|
| 5:04:55| in those utility easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18295)|
| 5:04:58| Okay, can you say the language again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18298)|
| 5:05:03| Stormwater facilities, retaining walls and fences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18303)|
| 5:05:07| may be installed at the property owner's risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18307)|
| 5:05:10| subject to the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18310)|
| 5:05:12| of the City Department of Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18312)|
| 5:05:14| Yeah, so the whole paragraph was changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18314)|
| 5:05:17| Thank you, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18317)|
| 5:05:19| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18319)|
| 5:05:20| These things are complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18320)|
| 5:05:22| The motion to amend has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18322)|
| 5:05:24| Does everyone understand what the amendment is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18324)|

| 5:08:34| a very similar thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18514)|
| 5:08:35| In this particular instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18515)|
| 5:08:37| the townhouses were left out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18517)|
| 5:08:40| where it says multifamily dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18520)|
| 5:08:43| And in the same course of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18523)|
| 5:08:45| with all the members that we talked about before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18525)|

| 5:09:02| in Table 12-2, buffer yard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18542)|
| 5:09:06| would read parking lot of a townhouse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18546)|
| 5:09:10| or multifamily dwelling abutting RN3, RN2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18550)|

| 5:09:21| to add townhouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18561)|
| 5:09:23| And then I'll follow that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-200519?start=18563)|
