| 0:04:14| Okay, moving quickly then on to a mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=254)|

| 0:04:34| They're great for our community in a lot of ways, so there's nothing that helps people keep coming back like a friendly thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=274)|
| 0:04:41| So please, if you would do that, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=281)|

| 0:04:50| While TDOT does its biannual inspection, it's scheduled for tomorrow and Thursday as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=290)|
| 0:04:59| Hopefully, it may or may not take that long, but definitely scheduled for tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=299)|
| 0:05:03| And the City's Free Summer Concert Series continues this year with Knoxville Community Recreation Band performances on Market Square and out at the Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=303)|

| 0:05:21| And that is all the announcements I have, announcements from members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=321)|
| 0:05:29| I'll just remind the massive viewing public about the City Council workshop on Thursday, June 26th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=329)|
| 0:05:36| on the proposed ordinance for parking in front yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| I'm trying to limit that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=339)|
| 0:05:41| And that's June 26th, 5 o'clock, in this room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| Thank you. So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| Any other reports by members of council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=346)|

| 0:07:02| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=422)|
| 0:07:04| Excuse me, Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=424)|
| 0:07:07| If I read this correctly, really all we're doing is changing our ordinance to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| compare with the state's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| We're not adding anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| I think you want to comment. I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=435)|
| 0:07:17| I have a little problem with the whole issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=437)|
| 0:07:19| That's a good, fair question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=439)|
| 0:07:21| I'm sorry. I should have noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=441)|
| 0:07:22| I should have looked for your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| Mr. Ivey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=444)|
| 0:07:26| The answer is yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| It's to make it comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=447)|
| 0:07:28| And I might say state statute was substantially formed around our language to begin with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=448)|
| 0:07:33| but there were some modifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| But this does adopt to the state language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| Okay. Let me start over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=459)|
| 0:07:40| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=460)|
| 0:07:41| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| I heard one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=463)|
| 0:07:44| Okay. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=464)|
| 0:07:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=466)|
| 0:07:47| 9D is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B, zoning regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=467)|
| 0:07:50| Article V, Section 10, signs, billboards, and other advertising structures and related sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| regarding the operating regulations of electronic message centers in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=475)|
| 0:08:01| There are several folks signed up to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=481)|
| 0:08:07| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| I'm not sure if anybody signed up to speak for it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=490)|
| 0:08:14| I think there's one that says for it, but I don't actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=494)|
| 0:08:17| Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=497)|
| 0:08:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| I know I've had some discussions with people in the city administration who've talked about some work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=499)|
| 0:08:24| that needs to be done on this and might be asking for a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=504)|
| 0:08:28| And I'm wondering if we want to consider that or listen to folks in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=508)|
| 0:08:33| Councils will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| We do have several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| We have one, two, three folks signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| I don't want to circumvent public process either, but I know that I have some concerns about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=523)|
| 0:08:49| and would like to call on Ms. Cash at some point to follow up on some of the discussion we had two weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=529)|
| 0:08:56| about the ability of her department to enforce this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| Would you like to do that first or hear the speakers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=540)|
| 0:09:02| It's your pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=542)|
| 0:09:05| I'd like to hear it first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=545)|
| 0:09:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=546)|
| 0:09:07| Ms. Cash, if you could come up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| I know this is your first time, so if you could give us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| Anita Cash, zoning coordinator with the city of Knoxville, 160 Bird Road, Lenore City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=557)|
| 0:09:23| If you remember two weeks ago when this was on, I believe for first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=563)|
| 0:09:29| some concern was expressed regarding the enforcement issue as it related to brightness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=569)|
| 0:09:35| We were instructed at that time to try to develop some language that would be enforceable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=575)|
| 0:09:41| because as it's written now, it is not enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=581)|
| 0:09:44| I have spent the better part of a week trying to find that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| There's 200 and something thousand websites that refer you to brightness on electronic message centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=590)|
| 0:09:58| and of all the ones I've looked at so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=598)|
| 0:10:01| the only one that has anything in there that you can measure by is Murfreesboro, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| We had had at a presentation, if you'll remember Councilwoman Roddy and Councilwoman Pelow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=607)|
| 0:10:17| a lady from Texas when we did this a number of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| and I have sent her an email to see if she can give us some direction and point me in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=621)|
| 0:10:28| I checked just before I came down here, and I've not heard back from her yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| It is our opinion, as the ordinance is right now, it is not enforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=632)|
| 0:10:37| so we are still attempting to find that language and get it developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=637)|
| 0:10:45| I guess based on that information, I would think it would be appropriate for Council to consider a postponement at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| I'm reluctant to pass something that our zoning inspector doesn't feel is enforceable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| and it sounds like this might take longer than two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=656)|
| 0:10:59| If there are folks, I'm going to make a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| However, if there are folks who have taken the time to come down tonight who still want to address Council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| I'm happy to listen to them, but I'd like to postpone this ordinance for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| To allow some time for us to work with our zoning inspector department and see if we can get some better language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| Thank you. Mr. Foster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| Two-pronged question. First, will four weeks be sufficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| Well, I would hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| Okay. Second question, I guess this is for Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| Also coming up later on the agenda is an extension of the moratorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| Do we need to do something with bumping that up on the agenda to be considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=695)|
| 0:11:40| or will this continued postponement keep the original moratorium in effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=700)|
| 0:11:46| I think it will keep the moratorium in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=706)|
| 0:11:51| If you postpone it and then pass later on in the same evening, I don't see anyone taking applications up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| So between now and the time that you get to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| I don't think there will be an application for an electronic message center file.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| Okay. I didn't know if one ended because it still has to be signed and everything, there might be a gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=724)|
| 0:12:11| I don't think it creates a gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| Thank you. Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| I know there's three folks signed up to speak, Joyce Feld, Jim Dorop, and Gene Burr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| Since you've come, if you'd like to express anything tonight, we, I think, Miss Feld, if you want to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=743)|
| 0:12:37| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| My name is Joyce Feld. My address is 1540 Aguila Avenue, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=761)|
| 0:12:49| And I appreciate you folks letting me address you yet again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| I hope you're not getting too tired of hearing from me. I will make it brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| I do want to point out that I think it's clear there are strong negative feelings in our community concerning the use of electronic advertising,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=778)|
| 0:13:07| as evidenced by the fact that in the last week alone, there have been three citizen-authored articles printed in the New Sentinel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=787)|
| 0:13:17| And, yes, I authored one of them, but I don't even know the other two folks, so I was glad to see that they were there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=797)|
| 0:13:26| Obviously, some of my remarks are no longer relevant, but I would just like to say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| I would encourage you to consider sending this issue back to MPC with a request that it come back to you with an option to vote for no new EMCs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=812)|
| 0:13:46| And for those EMCs that are currently in existence legally, and I do believe that there are some that might not be legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=826)|
| 0:13:54| I would ask you to consider the following changes to the proposed amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| One, I would ask you to extend the new ordinance to government-owned signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| If council is concerned about having the use of these signs in an emergency, a clause which would allow the city to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=846)|
| 0:14:13| to use them in an emergency, can be included in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=853)|
| 0:14:17| My second point addresses Ms. Cash's role in this, so I won't get smoot at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=857)|
| 0:14:26| I think there should be a limit on the brightness and the number of colors that can be used in one sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=866)|
| 0:14:32| and preferably a sign should be allowed to use maybe only one color, and the hue of that color should be subdued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=872)|
| 0:14:39| And I also would like you to consider limiting the size of an EMC to a maximum of 20 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=879)|
| 0:14:47| Currently, as stated in Articles 5 and 6, the maximum allowable size is 100 square feet, which seems quite large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=887)|
| 0:14:56| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| Thank you, Mr. Dropper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| Mr. Brewer, would you like to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| Gene says he's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=903)|
| 0:15:04| Mr. Dropper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=908)|
| 0:15:09| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=911)|
| 0:15:12| The motion on the floor is to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| Any further comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=916)|
| 0:15:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=919)|
| 0:15:20| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=920)|
| 0:15:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| Postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Nine E is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B, zoning regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| regulating the size of residential accessory buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=936)|
| 0:15:37| The last person to speak, Mr. Joe Feuer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=937)|
| 0:15:47| Joe Feuer, 623 Broom Road, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| Mr. Mayor, members of Council, as you all know, I represent tonight more than 20 communities represented across the spread of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=951)|
| 0:16:01| who have spent a month and a half or more discussing various zoning ordinance changes that have been proposed by MPC in the recent past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=961)|
| 0:16:11| Particularly on the accessory, we appreciate the activities of the MPC director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| and the direction which they have taken in responding to the problem which had existed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| that generated an increased number of BZA variance requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=981)|
| 0:16:26| We do, however, request a little tweaking of the table which the MPC has presented which will reduce the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=986)|
| 0:16:33| or the size, excuse me, of the accessory structures permitted depending upon the lot sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| I have given again to each member of the Council tonight a table with the community requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=999)|
| 0:16:47| changes in the MPC sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1007)|
| 0:16:51| We appreciate the support which we have received from Council at various meetings and at workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| and we hope we'll continue to receive your support tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| I do want to make mention also that we do support the definition of building or accessory structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1020)|
| 0:17:06| which indicated it had to be under roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| This would exempt recreational improvements such as breezeways, patios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1029)|
| 0:17:15| tennis courts, swimming pools which did not have roofs on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| Yes, I think I'd like to actually make the amendment that Mr. Fuhrer discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1043)|
| 0:17:27| And Mr. Swanson, we have a handout in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| Can I just say I want to substitute what's on this handout for the chart that's in front of us or do I have to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1051)|
| 0:17:38| As long as we furnish it to the city recorder who does not currently have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1058)|
| 0:17:41| Who now currently has one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| I would like to make the amendment to substitute this chart for the chart that's in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1063)|
| 0:17:48| I second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1068)|
| 0:17:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| Seconded several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1070)|
| 0:17:52| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1073)|
| 0:17:54| Yes, Ms. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| There's just two little problems with either one of these tables that you choose to fix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1077)|
| 0:18:02| but you can fix it with two words and I'd like to ask you to do that from an enforcement standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1082)|
| 0:18:09| On the first, the second column, on the second and third ones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| you need to add the words greater than 900 square feet and greater than 1100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1095)|
| 0:18:22| You can't have 900 and 1100 in two places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1102)|
| 0:18:28| It will be in a-if you look where it says 15 square feet, 15,000 square feet or less,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1108)|
| 0:18:35| it says 750 square feet or up to 1100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| Then the next column, the next row down says the exact same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| It says 1100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| It's got to be greater than 1100 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1126)|
| 0:18:49| If you're right at 1100 square feet, you're in two boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| So, yeah, you've got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| It's a greater than or greater or equal to kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| So the wording would be exactly, Anita?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1139)|
| 0:19:03| It would be greater than 900 as the motion is to amend per that form that was submitted tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1143)|
| 0:19:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| On the column that says more than 15,000 square feet to less than one acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1159)|
| 0:19:25| you need to add greater than before the 900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| On the second row, you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1173)|
| 0:19:36| May I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| Are you including equal to or greater than?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1178)|
| 0:19:42| Or are you saying it's got to be 901 plus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1182)|
| 0:19:47| If you go with the top one that says 900 square feet is the maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1191)|
| 0:19:52| You can't put 900 square feet in the next column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| It's got to be greater than 900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| Just greater than there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1198)|
| 0:19:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| We don't do that, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| So you put greater than in front of the 900 square feet in the third row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| and you put greater than in front of 1,100 square feet in the fourth row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1207)|
| 0:20:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| Greater than in front of the 900 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| Greater than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1216)|
| 0:20:17| So it wouldn't begin with the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1217)|
| 0:20:19| It would begin with those words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1219)|
| 0:20:20| But, no, that would open this up to say you can have an unlimited size building as a use on review, wouldn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1220)|
| 0:20:27| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| Forget what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| Forget what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| I was trying to extend it with the whichever is less language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| So we don't need any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1239)|
| 0:20:40| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| I thought so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1242)|
| 0:20:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1243)|
| 0:20:44| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| Right now the motion on the floor is the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1248)|
| 0:20:49| Ready to vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| All those in favor of the amendment, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1250)|

| 0:23:12| There are folks signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| I'm taking it that Council would like to hear from them first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| Then there's some folks in favor who may speak first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| I know there's at least one and maybe two to speak against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Yes, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| I'm David Wiggler, 8956 Shallowford Road, Knoxville, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1406)|
| 0:23:32| It's a pleasure to be here this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1412)|
| 0:23:34| I represent Ray Fabian in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| And before I begin my comments, I have a question on a couple of points of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| First of all, we have a petition that's been signed by approximately 60 people in this neighborhood that I'd like to present to Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1420)|
| 0:23:51| If you want to just bring it up and they can pass it around or you can bring it to the recorder, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1431)|
| 0:23:56| You can start with Mr. Holquist here as the first Council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1436)|
| 0:24:07| These approximately 60 people in the neighborhood have no objection to the house as presently constructed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1447)|
| 0:24:13| and they include, importantly, the two neighbors on each side of this particular house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1453)|
| 0:24:20| The second point of order is I do have a witness here that has some information I'd like to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1460)|
| 0:24:28| Would the Council prefer if I bring him up or I could --?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1468)|
| 0:24:34| There are several ways to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| You can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| I mean, you have a total of you can have three speakers who speak for five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| So if you would like to have that person be one of those, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| Very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1485)|
| 0:24:47| Members of the Council, Mr. Mayor, zoning issues are very, very difficult matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1487)|
| 0:24:54| They are difficult because they involve competing important principles under our Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1494)|
| 0:25:02| On one hand, we want to protect neighborhoods and we want to preserve the rights of people to act collectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1502)|
| 0:25:10| to preserve the quality and the character of their neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1510)|
| 0:25:14| and that is the purpose that supports the infield housing overlay zoning that I've come to learn about in the last three weeks or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1514)|
| 0:25:24| The competing purpose is the property right, the freedoms of citizens in our country to do what they wish with their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1524)|
| 0:25:36| Now, how do we balance those competing important principles of property rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1536)|
| 0:25:43| and of preserving the quality and character of neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1543)|
| 0:25:45| We do it through reasonable regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1545)|
| 0:25:51| The operative word, an important word here, being reasonable regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| One of the factors that must define any reasonable regulation, I suggest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1557)|
| 0:26:04| is that it must be clearly communicated to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| It must be clearly presented to the builders what they must do in order that they may comply with the reasonable regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1569)|
| 0:26:20| The regulation regarding foundation height at issue in this case was never clearly communicated to Mr. Faubion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1580)|
| 0:26:32| He had no way to know, and you have before you, I hope that the council, all members have before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1592)|
| 0:26:41| the report of Dr. Stanley Rabin, an architect and licensed engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| These were furnished about a week ago and I understood were put in your boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| On this point, Dr. Rabin says that a proposed floor elevation on a survey is intended and known in the industry to be a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1613)|
| 0:27:05| It is designed to create enough fall for the sewer lines so that we don't have sewer problems with KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1625)|
| 0:27:13| It is not designed as a maximum, and if it's intended as a maximum, it should be clearly stated as a maximum floor elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1633)|
| 0:27:21| We do not have in the permit in this case, and if Mr. Tom Reynolds could come up at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1641)|
| 0:27:34| Mr. Reynolds, of course, members of the council and Mr. Mayor, you know him as the building, zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1654)|
| 0:27:40| and plans review chief for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| And so that I'm not giving you evidence here tonight, I'd like to just ask Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1664)|
| 0:27:55| Is this a legal proceeding we're going through here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| I'm not certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1677)|
| 0:27:59| I'm not sure if this is following our normal procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1679)|
| 0:28:02| Is this the end of your?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1682)|
| 0:28:04| Mr. Wigler, are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| You have just a way around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| You have five minutes to speak in your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| And then any other speaker that wants to speak also has five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1690)|
| 0:28:14| And then once the folks speaking against it speak, then you have two minutes as a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| I understood we had 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1699)|
| 0:28:20| I propose to use the entire time and part of it with Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| Unless council waives the rules, each speaker has a five-minute limit with up to three speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1705)|
| 0:28:32| I would ask council to waive the rules since we only have one and a few comments from Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1712)|
| 0:28:37| That is council's prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1717)|
| 0:28:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| There's a motion to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1720)|
| 0:28:41| Is there a second by Mr. Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1721)|
| 0:28:43| The motion is to waive the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| I think the speaker would like to use all 15 minutes for himself to present the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1725)|
| 0:28:52| Everybody understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| And my understanding is he's going to bring his other person up, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| If I had 15 minutes, I would have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1738)|
| 0:29:00| And I would just point out to council that we've had occasions before where council attorneys have represented individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| and they would start out with sort of an introduction, sit down, let someone get their three or four or five minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| and come in and sort of wrap up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1750)|
| 0:29:12| So I envision it's what you're trying to say you want to do with your process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| Essentially, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1757)|
| 0:29:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| We're back to the vote now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1760)|
| 0:29:21| The motion is to let him basically use all 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1761)|
| 0:29:23| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1765)|
| 0:29:27| How much time is remaining, Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| They've used about seven minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1769)|
| 0:29:31| You understand that, councilor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| Go ahead, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1774)|

| 0:29:58| but I was asked to come to this council to answer questions specific as to the submission of our permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1798)|
| 0:30:06| to permit this structure being built at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1806)|
| 0:30:10| And I'd be happy to answer any questions from Mr. Wiggler or from the council, impartially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| It might be more appropriate since you're not really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| maybe if you just sat at the table as a staff member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1818)|
| 0:30:21| and you can comment in that way just like any other staff member would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1821)|
| 0:30:24| that's probably the most appropriate way to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1824)|
| 0:30:28| I'm afraid I'll run out of time if I continue that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| What I'd like to do is just explain what my understanding of the facts are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1831)|
| 0:30:35| Mr. Reynolds is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| If the council has any questions about my representations of those facts, the council can ask those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1837)|
| 0:30:43| It is clear there is no maximum foundation height on the permit in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1843)|
| 0:30:49| There is no maximum foundation height on the plans that were approved by MPC in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1849)|
| 0:30:56| There is no maximum foundation height on the certificate of appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| that was approved by the Enfield Housing Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| And there is only, regarding foundation height, a proposed foundation height on the survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1865)|
| 0:31:14| And, council members, you have a letter from Mr. Luthke, the surveyor who did the survey in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1874)|
| 0:31:21| stating that he intended that proposed foundation height to be a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1881)|
| 0:31:27| If it was to be communicated by the MPC and by the Enfield Housing Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1887)|
| 0:31:33| to Mr. Fabian that there was a minimum foundation height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| it should have been clearly stated so in one of these important documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1898)|
| 0:31:42| Mr. Fabian, relying on industry standards, wanted to build the house better, wanted to build it well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1902)|
| 0:31:49| and so he raised the foundation up from what he perceived and what the industry perceives to be a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1909)|
| 0:31:56| There is no precedent created here by overruling the stop work order, and that's what I ask you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1916)|
| 0:32:03| There's no precedent created because all you have to do is ask the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1923)|
| 0:32:09| All the MPC has to do is put a minimum foundation level on the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1929)|
| 0:32:15| or on the permit if they want to seek to enforce one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1935)|
| 0:32:20| Mr. Fabian has proposed to comply with a proposal from the East Tennessee Community Design Center that was submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1940)|
| 0:32:33| and that shows raising the elevation of the soil of the front yard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1953)|
| 0:32:40| so that the exposed elevation would be exactly as this community apparently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| or certain members of this community expected to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| We suggest this would completely comply with any sense of reasonableness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| The peak of the house, council members can see from looking at this drawing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1975)|
| 0:33:02| the peak of the house, it's the center house, is exactly the same height as the houses on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1982)|
| 0:33:09| What Mr. Fabian has been asked to do is lower the foundation by two blocks or 16 inches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1989)|
| 0:33:17| and raise the roof by 15 1⁄2 inches for a net change of 1⁄2 inch at a tremendous, tremendous expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=1997)|
| 0:33:30| Mistakes have been made in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| This is a new infield housing overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| It's somewhat understandable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| There is not a form, there is not a place in any of the paperwork in this file for a maximum foundation level to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2019)|
| 0:33:48| Mr. Fabian will rebuild the foundation wall as proposed by East Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| will add to the height of the front yard, minimizing any impact of the foundation height whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2034)|
| 0:34:01| We're only talking about 16 inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| He can raise the soil that much very easily and be much more uniform with the house to the right side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2044)|
| 0:34:12| It's a very reasonable proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| He will also correct the roof pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| He admits he made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| He made a mistake building this with a 412 pitch instead of a 512.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2058)|
| 0:34:23| He'll correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| Now, what do they ask for and what do they get?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| They get a house then that would be taller by 15 1⁄2 inches than the ones on either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| But he will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| And that expense is great, but it's not anywhere near what it costs to jack this house up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2075)|
| 0:34:41| remove two courses of a foundation that's put together with hurricane straps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| so that it's going to bust up and have to be repaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| It's an overwhelming expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| It's an unreasonable application of a zoning law that has not been clearly and properly communicated to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2091)|
| 0:34:59| The fact that there are members of the community who will come to speak tonight in opposition to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2099)|
| 0:35:13| must be weighed against the reasonableness of what's being asked to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| must be weighed against the fact that there are approximately 60 members of the same community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| that think it's fine the way it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| and must be weighed against the fact that the net effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2126)|
| 0:35:29| if everything the community members speaking here tonight want is accomplished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| the overall effect of the house will change by 1⁄2 inch at tremendous cost to Mr. Fabian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2134)|
| 0:35:42| If the council has any question about these matters from Mr. Reynolds, he's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2142)|
| 0:35:49| and that's the reason I brought him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| And thank you very much for hearing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2154)|
| 0:35:55| Question for Tom Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2155)|
| 0:35:56| Who asked you to come?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| Who asked you to come tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Mr. Wiggler asked the director if I may come tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| Is Mr. Fabian here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| Yes, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| Would you come forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| If you could give us your name and address, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| My name is Charles Ray Fabian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| I live at 3437 Joseph Gate Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37931.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2187)|
| 0:36:28| Now, do you build houses for a living?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| Build them throughout Knoxville and Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Are you not familiar with knowing the building codes and zoning regulations where you build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| So what happened here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| I mean, we had infill housing overlay guidelines that went through public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2207)|
| 0:36:55| NPC, city council, they're of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2215)|
| 0:37:01| You go and get a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2221)|
| 0:37:04| The overlays or the infill housing is going to be noted on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2224)|
| 0:37:11| So what's the difference on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| On the overlay, sir, when I went to NPC and filled out the application, I took the plans and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2234)|
| 0:37:22| and Mr. Archer asked me to mark on the plans what we was doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2242)|
| 0:37:27| And then I marked the plans, turned the plans in, and they got approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| And what we had done on the plans that we'd recently went over, he wanted me to put the roof pitches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2253)|
| 0:37:38| what was changing on everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| And that's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2262)|
| 0:37:43| We filled it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2263)|
| 0:37:44| We got the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2264)|
| 0:37:45| We went over and started a foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2265)|
| 0:37:47| Well, I always have a survey person come and survey my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2267)|
| 0:37:52| And he does my elevations and plot plans and foundation sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2272)|
| 0:37:57| Well, when he gives me a plot plan, unless we're in a flood plain where you have a maximum floor elevation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2277)|
| 0:38:04| when they shoot the elevation, they give you a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| And that's what I took it as was a minimum floor elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2288)|
| 0:38:12| So when you get a minimum floor elevation, you've got to come up to at least that minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| And what I have is I've got the lot slopes from front to back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2296)|
| 0:38:20| It drops real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2300)|
| 0:38:22| And I had took the old house down that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| And all the water had run under it and it had rotted that house down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| So I didn't want to put the brand-new house there and have water running underneath my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2308)|
| 0:38:33| And I have an 18-inch trunk line that goes through for my heat and air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| And so I brought it up, you know, to the one, I think it was 110.7 and shot it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| And usually that's the way we do in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| We have a minimum floor elevation unless we're in a flood plain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2327)|
| 0:38:51| If we're in a flood plain, then we've got to take it to the maximum floor elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| And that's the reason I did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| You bump it up against the floor joists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Bump what up against the floor joists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| Bump the heat and air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| At one end of my house, I don't have, I think it's like 31 inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| So that would give me 18 inches down from my girder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| So actually my duck is about 8 inches off the ground when you run my 18-inch main truck line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| until you get down towards the front of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2360)|
| 0:39:21| But you could have put it in the attic, couldn't you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| Well, in a 512, per code, you can't put the unit in the attic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| because you don't have enough height on a 512 to stand your unit up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2368)|
| 0:39:32| But I thought you were doing a 912 pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| That's where some of the problems come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| When I went to MPC on the plans that we signed off, we changed the pitch to a 512.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2377)|
| 0:39:43| You also went from a hip to a gabled roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| That was on the plans that we signed off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| I mean, we signed off on these plans showing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| showing that it was going to be a 512 gabled roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| And that's what I turned in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Are you saying what you built was what was approved at MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2400)|
| 0:40:01| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| We owned the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| I made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2403)|
| 0:40:04| On the roof pitch, what we did was we calculated the box of the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| which the box of the house is 28 inches wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| And we didn't add the overhangs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| So that's 36 inches we were short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| So when you cut the rafters and put them up there, it was 36 inches short of being a 512.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2417)|
| 0:40:23| And I made the mistake, but, honestly, I didn't do it on purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2423)|
| 0:40:27| I made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| And that's the reason the roof pitch that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| When they put a stop work order on it, I went to Mr. Reynolds' office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2432)|
| 0:40:35| and Mr. Reynolds asked me, and I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2435)|
| 0:40:37| Mr. Reynolds, I went back out there and checked it, and I made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2437)|
| 0:40:41| And that's an honest mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2441)|
| 0:40:44| And so I told Mr. Reynolds, I said, Mr. Reynolds, it's a 412.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| I made the mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| And, like I say, the floor elevations is standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2449)|
| 0:40:52| When they go out and shoot your floor elevations, they give you a minimum, not a maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| And I didn't know that that was supposed to have been the maximum floor elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| And I talked to Mr. Archer about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| Then I went and met back with him and told him what we could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2462)|
| 0:41:06| or what I'd be willing to do to change it to make it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| And we proposed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| And then someone had proposed a retaining wall in the front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| and I didn't know nothing about that at the last meeting until that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2475)|
| 0:41:19| But I told them I'd do everything I can to make it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| I told them I'd take the roof off and put a 512 on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| But if I drop my foundation, I'm going to have the same problem as the old house was there before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| I'll have water rolling underneath my house, and there will be mold and mildew underneath it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2493)|
| 0:41:38| And that causes problems for builders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2498)|
| 0:41:42| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| I have a quick question for Mr. Weigler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2506)|
| 0:41:51| Weigler, Weigler, Weigler, Weigler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2511)|
| 0:41:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| Well, that explains a lot about him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2517)|
| 0:42:01| You had faxed me, I don't know if other people got this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2521)|
| 0:42:04| a certified document here from Michael Luthke, who's a surveyor, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2524)|
| 0:42:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2533)|
| 0:42:14| I just want to read something here and see if I understand this the way it sounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2534)|
| 0:42:18| This is stamped and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2538)|
| 0:42:20| It says the floor elevation shown on the map was 109 feet, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| And the next sentence says this elevation, meaning that 109 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| was two foot above the highest point of ground adjacent to the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| Am I reading that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2554)|
| 0:42:35| That's the way I read it, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2555)|
| 0:42:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2556)|
| 0:42:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2557)|
| 0:42:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| Thank you very much, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2560)|
| 0:42:41| Now we have at least one and maybe two folks lined up speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2561)|
| 0:42:44| So if you guys want to come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2566)|
| 0:42:47| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2567)|
| 0:42:48| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2568)|
| 0:42:49| Before you come up, Mr. Hall, I think, has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| Mr. Reynolds, was pretty much what these gentlemen have stated before accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2571)|
| 0:42:59| About what they built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2579)|
| 0:43:00| Yes, about what they built and about the plans, about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| how there was nothing that stated that that being a maximum foundation height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2584)|
| 0:43:12| or anything in the plans or when they go through the review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| does anybody note anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| That's always discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2601)|
| 0:43:22| But this particular review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2602)|
| 0:43:25| I was not present when this particular plan was approved at the infill committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| I wasn't at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| There is, however, I would just go on to give you this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| When we issue a building permit for a structure in infill housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2618)|
| 0:43:44| it's issued with a letter of appropriateness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| which becomes part of the building permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| and the building permit is conditioned upon that letter of appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| And there is language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| there's usually language describing some of the requirements that would be required of the builder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2634)|
| 0:44:03| when he's building the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2643)|
| 0:44:08| Does it state this foundation height in that letter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2648)|
| 0:44:15| Well, I'll read the letter of appropriateness to you if you would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| This is listed on the letter of appropriateness as a description of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| The front yard setback is 26 feet and the two side yard setbacks are 11 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| The applicant will maintain an existing tree in the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| The porch will be 8 feet deep by 16 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| The house has the front door off the porch with a window located on the left side of the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2681)|
| 0:44:47| The roof pitch is 9-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2687)|
| 0:44:51| The exposed foundation is block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| Parking for the house will be supplied off the alley with 10-foot wide by 36 feet deep driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2695)|
| 0:45:05| And that's the description of the work in the letter of appropriateness for which the building permit was issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2705)|
| 0:45:11| I guess what I'm trying to get at is would an average builder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| like some of these people we're talking about here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| would he know if he had never built a house in this infill zone here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| would he have the knowledge to know that that foundation is just supposed to be so high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2723)|
| 0:45:30| From anything that the city gave him or from the plans that the city reviewed or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2730)|
| 0:45:35| would he have something that says that you're supposed to put this this height and no higher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2735)|
| 0:45:43| In writing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| Well, or if it was even conveyed to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2745)|
| 0:45:47| I mean, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| Well, I wasn't at the original meeting of approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| So I don't know what was said to him at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| But from the documentation that I have in the building permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| from what's on paper that I can force and look at, I don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2766)|
| 0:46:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| Those speaking against, give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| My name is James Allen, representing Lonsdale United for Change, 3132 Galbraith Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2773)|
| 0:46:21| I'll start, first of all, with the foundation height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| The scale maps and foundation heights of early homes throughout Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| were consistent with one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| especially the foundation heights resulting in architectural compatibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| harmony, and balance among houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| In 2002, before the infill housing design guidelines existed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| Habitat for Humanity built a house at 1337 Delaware Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| next door and to the left of this new infill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| That respected the foundation height of early Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| The topography for that Habitat house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| and the new infill at 1333 Delaware are essentially the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| The dissimilarity is the builder, Charles Fabian, of 1333 Delaware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| chose and favored to reduce excavation costs for increased financial justification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| The recommendation or proposed plant or dirt buildup around the foundation of this new infill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2831)|
| 0:47:17| possibly might mask a portion of the exposed foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| but A, with the current finished floor elevation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| being approximately two feet higher than other houses on the block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| architectural harmony will definitely be lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| Flooding, mildew, and mold issues become a concern for downhill neighboring houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| because of increased dirt buildup and likely water runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| We'll go to the roof pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| The roof pitch on the original submitted plans for the new infill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| called for a hip-style roof of 9-12 pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| It is now a gable-style roof with a 4-12 pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| The roof pitch was changed somewhere in the certificate of appropriateness to 5-12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| but per the city of Knoxville, it is actually a 4-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2876)|
| 0:48:00| As a result of the disproportionate foundation height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| and to reduce the likelihood of raising a red flag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| the builder knowingly cut the roof pitch back to reduce the height of the infill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| being completely out of harmony and balance with the other houses on the block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| I strongly suggest to council and basically beg of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2897)|
| 0:48:23| to deny this appeal because of its inconsistencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| regarding the infill housing design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| Considering the issue of this importance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2910)|
| 0:48:32| if a concession is made to the infill housing design guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| a new precedent will be set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| and the floodgates will be open to builders interested in maximizing profitability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| with no concern for the neighborhood or its property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| Approving this appeal compromises the hard work of the infill housing design review committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2927)|
| 0:48:51| and the citizens of not only Lonsdale, but of Oakwood-Lincoln Park and Edgewood Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| These neighborhoods are counting on these guidelines to not only work, but to be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2936)|
| 0:49:02| This is an unfortunate situation, but this appeal should be denied because it was self-created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| This should not be sufficient to entitle relief as continue building as is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| when the builder, by his own actions, knowingly created this hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2952)|
| 0:49:17| As well, consideration of expenditures by the builder should not provide an acceptable picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2957)|
| 0:49:23| of determining a form of economic hardship to continue building as is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| because, once again, this hardship was self-created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| Presently, three center city communities, Oakwood, Lincoln Park, Lonsdale, and Edgewood Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2971)|
| 0:49:36| are covered under the IH1 zoning overlay and the infill housing design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| Once again, these communities are depending on this process to work properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| It should not be the intent of this council to encourage or reward this type of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| because the builder tried to circumvent the proper legal process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| Lonsdale has came a long way in a very short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| and any type of negative development would greatly affect the progress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=2998)|
| 0:50:01| that our up-and-coming neighborhood has accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| I do have one correction to the e-mail that was sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3004)|
| 0:50:09| As of this morning, when the e-mail was sent out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| no attempt had been made to meet with Mr. Fabian with our neighborhood committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3012)|
| 0:50:17| At 1.15 this afternoon, I did get a call from Mr. Wiggler trying to schedule a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3017)|
| 0:50:26| I was not able to get a hold of all of the members or as many members as I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3026)|
| 0:50:33| of Lonsdale United for Change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| Actually, only my uncle and I were able to attend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3034)|
| 0:50:38| but I did bring some community members with me if they would like to stand, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3038)|
| 0:50:43| We did have proper notice about this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3043)|
| 0:50:46| and we do come supporting and asking for your support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| Any questions for Mr. Allen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3057)|
| 0:50:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3058)|
| 0:50:59| Right now there is no motion on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3062)|
| 0:51:03| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3063)|
| 0:51:04| You do have two minutes for rebuttal time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3064)|
| 0:51:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| Thank you, Mayor Haslam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| Mr. Reynolds correctly pointed out, and he's in a tough place here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3070)|
| 0:51:15| he works with these officials in the MPC and the infield housing committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3075)|
| 0:51:22| and you could see his reluctance to point out that there is nothing in the paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| that tells this builder that there would be a maximum foundation height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| and he's following what are good building practices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| according to Dr. Rabin in the report in front of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| by using and viewing this elevation on a survey as a minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3098)|
| 0:51:45| and all of a sudden is told that that was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3105)|
| 0:51:49| There's no precedent set here by reversing the stop work order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3109)|
| 0:51:56| and that's because on the certificate of appropriateness that Mr. Reynolds read to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3116)|
| 0:52:01| the only thing dealing with the foundation was, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| the exposed foundation is block, close quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| All they have to do in these three neighborhoods that have the IH1 zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| is put in that certificate or in the building permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| or in the approved plan somewhere a maximum foundation height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| They need to clearly communicate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3144)|
| 0:52:26| If they do so, then this matter would never be a precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3146)|
| 0:52:30| because it did not occur in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3150)|
| 0:52:34| There is no evidence that Mr. Fabian did this intentionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| There's no evidence that he knew anything other than this foundation height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3159)|
| 0:52:44| was intended to be a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| There's no evidence that he intentionally did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| He admitted the problem with the roof pitch being 4'12 as opposed to 5'12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3170)|
| 0:52:55| at the earliest opportunity when he was first asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| He made a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3178)|
| 0:53:00| He's offered to correct that mistake and tear off a roof and raise it up to 5'12 as approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3180)|
| 0:53:08| The certificate approves it as a 9'12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| which would render this house much taller than the houses in the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| and I don't think anybody's arguing for that, but he would do that if that was the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3198)|
| 0:53:24| The foundation height, though, is what is unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| To correct that under these circumstances where he was never told there was a maximum foundation height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3208)|
| 0:53:36| I suggest would be unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| Unless there are any questions, I thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3220)|
| 0:53:41| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3221)|
| 0:53:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3222)|
| 0:53:43| I had a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3223)|
| 0:53:44| Mr. Fabian, approximately how much would it cost to change the roof?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| You will need to come down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3228)|
| 0:53:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| You will need to come down to the microphone just so we can make sure everything gets recorded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3230)|
| 0:53:57| Sir, to take the roof off, it would cost about $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3237)|
| 0:54:00| $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3240)|
| 0:54:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| Sorry to make you get up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| We stick built that roof system, and you can use two-by-sixes for rafters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| but I didn't use two-by-sixes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| I used two-by-eights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3250)|
| 0:54:11| I went a step above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3251)|
| 0:54:13| But to tear all the sheeting, what sheeting we have on, all the rafters and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| it would be about, time said and labor, I'd say about $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| I wanted to ask Mr. Allen a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3262)|
| 0:54:23| You mentioned a minute ago that you tried to get in touch with Mr. Fabian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| What did you hope to accomplish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| I wasn't really sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| We just had open ears to any suggestions that could be made or were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3273)|
| 0:54:41| Basically, the only suggestion was made that we support what the architectural consultant gave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3281)|
| 0:54:51| and what the construction review person gave to support those documents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3291)|
| 0:55:00| And we basically told Mr. Wiggler, Mr. Fabian, nothing personal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| but we cannot support this because it is not what's best for Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3305)|
| 0:55:10| I'm just wondering, as someone that supports these infill housing overlays and where we are at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| is there anything that you think he could do besides taking the blocks out cosmetically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| or otherwise to help create a better consistency or look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3321)|
| 0:55:31| I've heard Mr. Wiggler talk about if he did these things, it would come down an inch and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3331)|
| 0:55:36| I'm just wondering if there's any things you think you could work out with Mr. Fabian to try to fix it without going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3336)|
| 0:55:43| Aside from lowering the foundation height, every proposed plan has just been a masking for a problem that exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3343)|
| 0:55:51| I don't think that that one inch that is talking about such a low number is a very big number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3351)|
| 0:56:01| because where it is currently at, the top of the foundation height, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3361)|
| 0:56:07| the window line for this house is going to be in the roof of the house's next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| I mean, to me this is a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3372)|
| 0:56:18| But I have strong compassion and strong feelings for my neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| and for the architectural compatibility of my neighborhood to remain the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3384)|
| 0:56:30| One thing you mentioned in here is flooding, mildew, mold issues become a concern for downhill neighboring houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3390)|
| 0:56:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3397)|
| 0:56:38| Could you explain how that will happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3400)|
| 0:56:41| That's a whole separate another issue that should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| Basically what you have with the two lots is you have essentially the same topography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| If you raise the dirt fill up on 1333, then it is now above 1337,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3410)|
| 0:56:58| whose foundation height respected the foundation heights of early Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| I mean, I'm no expert, but water runs downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3423)|
| 0:57:09| And if there is dirt buildup to the house on to the right side of it and to the house on the left side of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3429)|
| 0:57:17| then essentially there could be concern for problems for those property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3437)|
| 0:57:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3445)|
| 0:57:26| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3446)|
| 0:57:27| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| Just a couple of quick questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3450)|
| 0:57:31| Mr. Fabian, can I ask you a couple of questions real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| Are you a home builder by trade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3456)|
| 0:57:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3457)|
| 0:57:38| How many homes have you built?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| I've been doing it for about 25 years, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| How long have you owned this lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3462)|
| 0:57:43| This lot I bought probably a year, maybe nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| I have several properties over there that I have renovated, and I take pride in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3468)|
| 0:57:55| I came from Lonsdale as a young person, and it's just like God to send me back to do something good in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3475)|
| 0:58:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3482)|
| 0:58:03| Before you began building, did you visually inspect the lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3483)|
| 0:58:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3486)|
| 0:58:07| Did you visually see the homes that are to the left and to the right of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| Let me ask you, with regards to the issue of maximum and minimum heights your attorney spoke to earlier, maybe he can answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3491)|
| 0:58:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3499)|
| 0:58:20| Under your scenario, Attorney Wigler, maybe he can answer this one better, or you answer this for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| What do you envision to be a maximum height since you say this speaks to minimum height?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| Well, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3508)|
| 0:58:29| Would six feet or eight feet or 12 feet be acceptable, Mr. Wigler, under your scenario with regards to since there's no maximum heights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3509)|
| 0:58:37| With regards to foundations, are you suggesting that a 12-foot foundation would be acceptable or a 15-foot foundation or 16?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3517)|
| 0:58:46| I should have made this comment earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| Mr. Reynolds has told me that Mr. Fabian can comply as built by adding soil to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3527)|
| 0:58:57| He can comply with the permit as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3537)|
| 0:59:01| There's nothing written as to a maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3541)|
| 0:59:04| Clearly, if there was something hugely excessive done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3544)|
| 0:59:07| You've made that very clear, and that's an interesting proposal that maybe you should talk to the neighborhood about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3547)|
| 0:59:12| or maybe flesh out a little more with counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3552)|
| 0:59:14| But under your scenario, you made an awful, you took an awful lot of time pointing out that, in your opinion, there is no maximum height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3554)|
| 0:59:22| So are you suggesting that, you know, if this was eight, nine, 10, 12 feet, it would be acceptable as a foundation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3562)|
| 0:59:29| I think at some point anything can become unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| Where would you think that line would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| I can't draw that line for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| What do you think should be taken into consideration in determining what that line should be and what would be reasonable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| I think what should be taken into consideration is that this man did not build an excessive height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| Dr. Rabin, in his report, discusses this being an appropriate height for the current building on that current lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3587)|
| 0:59:54| In determining what is a reasonable foundation, would you think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| considering the foundation and the homes in the area to be part of one of those criteria to determine reasonableness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| I certainly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3603)|
| 1:00:04| I certainly do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| And this is only 16 inches that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| They've asked him to lower the house by 16 inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3608)|
| 1:00:10| We're not talking about an excessive amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| Let me ask you this, and if you've given any thought to this, either you or Mr. Fabian, he builds homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3614)|
| 1:00:20| And I heard you earlier very clearly talking about this as possibly setting a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3620)|
| 1:00:26| What about the precedent of establishing ask forgiveness as opposed to approval or permission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3626)|
| 1:00:33| If we make this change here or agree to this appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3633)|
| 1:00:38| will we not be also setting a precedent of maybe seeing that folks could come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3638)|
| 1:00:43| and ask for forgiveness as opposed to approval or permission in the future?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| And is that not also a precedent we should consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| If there was any evidence that Mr. Fabian had done this intentionally, then I would agree with the point that you're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3650)|
| 1:00:58| But as Dr. Rabin stated in his report, it cost more to add to the height of this foundation as the structure was being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3658)|
| 1:01:07| There's no rational reason that Mr. Fabian would have done that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3667)|
| 1:01:13| other than he did not understand that there was any kind of a maximum foundation height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| There's no reason he would have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3679)|
| 1:01:20| Mr. Fabian, you spoke earlier about you care about this area and know about this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3680)|
| 1:01:25| You're also saying you had no knowledge of the infield guidelines when you started building this home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| I've got the plans that we signed off on on the day that I went up to the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3691)|
| 1:01:38| And the 512 was on the set of plans when we did it, because I didn't know you had to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3698)|
| 1:01:45| because I'm used to going to the county and getting permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3705)|
| 1:01:47| You heard the presentation from the representative of Lonsdale United for Change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3707)|
| 1:01:53| He implied at least that he thought maybe you made the decision to build this home this way to save money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Do you have any response to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| I didn't build that house like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3721)|
| 1:02:02| I went overboard on that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| I usually go above and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3724)|
| 1:02:08| I put hurricane clips in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3728)|
| 1:02:10| I put plenty of ventilation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| And you can check my ability through the county or the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3732)|
| 1:02:17| If they ask me to do something, I don't have no hesitation about doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| If it calls for two, usually I put three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| And I try to do what's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3743)|
| 1:02:26| Based on your experiences as a builder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3746)|
| 1:02:28| do you think the representation that there's a possibility of water runoff and mold in other homes to the left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3748)|
| 1:02:36| or to the right or in the neighborhood because of how you're building this home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3756)|
| 1:02:39| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| If you look at the house on both sides, there will be a swell in between both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3760)|
| 1:02:46| There's no way no water is going to run on either side of that house into the other two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3766)|
| 1:02:51| And the house beside me, I had talked to those people, and they have a nice house, like he said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3771)|
| 1:02:57| But the water comes right up to the top of their foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3777)|
| 1:03:01| When it goes into the swell, which direction is the water going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3781)|
| 1:03:04| If it goes in the swell, it will stay to my yard, the middle of my yard, 11 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3784)|
| 1:03:10| Then it goes straight down to the front, which runs into the street, which has manholes down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3790)|
| 1:03:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3796)|
| 1:03:17| If I could just add, he will have to get a new grading permit from the city to do that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3797)|
| 1:03:22| And that's what they would consider in approving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| And, secondly, it's those adjoining property owners who have signed this petition agreeing that they like the house as it's built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3804)|
| 1:03:32| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3812)|
| 1:03:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| Mr. Faubion, do you use Mr. Rabin on your projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3814)|
| 1:03:40| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| I just call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| I got an engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| I just got the phone book and called and found one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3823)|
| 1:03:46| I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3826)|
| 1:03:47| That's the only thing I had to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3827)|
| 1:03:48| I talked to everybody at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3828)|
| 1:03:50| I talked to the development people out there that had done my letter for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3830)|
| 1:03:55| And they had talked to me about doing the wall also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3835)|
| 1:03:59| And they said they would have just let me do the wall because once you raise the wall up, you don't have much slope in the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3839)|
| 1:04:06| And the house to the right and the house to the left, one of them has seven steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| The house to the right has seven steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3852)|
| 1:04:14| The house to the left has six steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| And I'll have six steps on that house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| Is Mr. Rabin here tonight to ask questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3862)|
| 1:04:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| Is there not an alternative drainage system that could be put in such as, just for the sake of argument,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3866)|
| 1:04:33| a French drain system in the periphery where it would take care?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3873)|
| 1:04:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| When I do around my foundation, which the dirt's still there and the rain has washed it into my foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3879)|
| 1:04:45| before I backfill it to my foundation, there will be black pie coming around my house to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3885)|
| 1:04:51| There's no way the front of that house is going to flood nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| It goes to the street and there are manholes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3894)|
| 1:04:57| And I'll have black pie around my foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3897)|
| 1:05:00| And, like I say, the water has washed it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3900)|
| 1:05:02| When Mr. Reynolds had given me a stop work order, I haven't done nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| My roof's wide open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3906)|
| 1:05:07| I have water running in my house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3907)|
| 1:05:09| My felt's blowing off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3909)|
| 1:05:11| And, you know, I'm just asking to cancel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| And I've got more property over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| And the next time I do a house infiltration, it won't be like this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| Like I say, I've got 21 properties in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| I'm proud.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| You can go, any member here can go over and walk in one of my houses and you'll see tile, hardwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| You'll see everything new in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| I don't want people living in rat holes and stuff out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3933)|
| 1:05:35| I had to live like that when I was young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3937)|
| 1:05:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| Ms. Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| Oh, you probably answered this question, but, Mr. Fabian, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3942)|
| 1:05:47| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| When you purchased this property, were you aware that it was an infield housing zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| No, ma'am, I wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3955)|
| 1:05:57| I didn't even know nothing about the infield housing until I went to apply for my permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3957)|
| 1:06:03| And that would maybe have been a good time to have looked at those guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3963)|
| 1:06:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| Well, now, I've got to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| There's a document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| Well, I think it just really clearly states to me that you would build a structure that was in keeping with the structures on each side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3970)|
| 1:06:18| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3978)|
| 1:06:19| And that's important to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3979)|
| 1:06:21| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3981)|
| 1:06:22| And the fact that you have more properties in Lonsdale is a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3986)|
| 1:06:27| And you're not aware of the importance of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| Yes, ma'am, I am aware of it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3988)|
| 1:06:30| And I think the vice mayor has already made the comment that I've been thinking all day about this and thinking, you know, it's a worry to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3990)|
| 1:06:37| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| That we set a precedent here where someone asks forgiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4001)|
| 1:06:42| Not permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| Knowing those guidelines is just so crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| And I can understand the citizens who were so involved in getting those infill guidelines drawn up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4007)|
| 1:06:53| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| Because they felt that this was their insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| That they were going to be able to have consistent structures built when it was necessary to remove a structure or add a structure to their area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4018)|
| 1:07:07| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| So this is a very difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| I know it's very difficult for you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| But I think it's very difficult for me to think that we would set a precedence here where there is no, there are no guidelines that are going to be adhered to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4032)|
| 1:07:21| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| Ms. Rodney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4043)|
| 1:07:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4044)|
| 1:07:25| I am not a builder and I am not an architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| I am a neighborhood advocate and I felt like it was important to go out and look at this house and look at this structure today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4048)|
| 1:07:34| And when I went and visited, Mr. Fabian was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| And he allowed me to enter the property and to walk around the rear and look at the houses to the left and to the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| And I will honestly say that my opinion of this situation changed when I went out and set foot on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4062)|
| 1:07:50| And I don't know how the rest of council feels, but to me this is one of those situations where you've got to walk the earth and see what it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4070)|
| 1:07:58| Some of the pictures are to me deceptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| They don't look like what you see when you get out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4082)|
| 1:08:05| There is slope on the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| All of the houses have a retaining wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4087)|
| 1:08:09| So if you're standing at the sidewalk for any house on that street, there's a retaining wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| You walk up a few stairs, then you're in the front yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4093)|
| 1:08:15| Then you walk up a few more stairs and you're in the house itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| And I don't know whether council would, I know we postponed this once before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| but I'm glad I went out to look at the house and to see the situation firsthand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4105)|
| 1:08:31| And if other council members haven't had the opportunity to do that on-site research, I would encourage you to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4111)|
| 1:08:36| and maybe to consider a postponement tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| I hate for the folks from Lonsdale who have come out tonight, but, you know, this is a new overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4119)|
| 1:08:46| And I think there was some miscommunication there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| I think there's certainly been a time loss here during the stop work order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| And Mr. Fabian has offered to make the roof right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| When you get out there, you can see that the roof slope probably isn't what you want relative to the other houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| But there's also the issue of raising the roof and then getting the roof way higher than everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| And I just would like to throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| If you haven't been out there and walked the earth, it doesn't substitute, pictures don't substitute for seeing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4149)|
| 1:09:17| Mr. or Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4157)|
| 1:09:21| And I don't like to have a practice of asking questions of other council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4161)|
| 1:09:27| but I want to make sure I understood what Council Member Roddy was saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| because it may beg the question that we may need to take another look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4171)|
| 1:09:37| And what you were saying, are you basically saying that the pictures don't do it justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4177)|
| 1:09:42| and the discrepancy between the buildings is not as graphic as it is on the pictures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4182)|
| 1:09:47| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| That was my feeling when I was out there today, that the pictures made it look like an egregious violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4189)|
| 1:09:58| And when I went out there and saw the house partly under construction, it's a solid, well-built house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4198)|
| 1:10:05| and all the houses have exposed foundation, at least the house to the right has an exposed foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4205)|
| 1:10:10| I drove down the rest of Delaware and looked around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4210)|
| 1:10:13| The house to the left does not have as much exposed foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4213)|
| 1:10:18| which I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4218)|
| 1:10:19| As the engineer says, the house to the left facing it, when you get in the backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| the dirt's right up against the top of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| I mean, you can see how that might be a problem in terms of drainage of water underneath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4227)|
| 1:10:33| And so, again, I'm not a builder, I'm not an architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4233)|
| 1:10:37| but you can understand when you get out there that water has to have a place to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| and you don't want it washing right up underneath your floorboards if you're a house over crawl space like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4241)|
| 1:10:47| And, you know, it's in an unfinished state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| There will be backfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4250)|
| 1:10:51| There will be swales that will direct the water around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| And I think to look at the pictures and count the number of cinder blocks that you see is an unfinished picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4255)|
| 1:11:03| I mean, there's backfill yet to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| There's landscaping to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4264)|
| 1:11:07| And for me, seeing it made a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4267)|
| 1:11:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| I guess it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4275)|
| 1:11:17| Actually, when Ms. Rowdy came, I was out looking at the property and been looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| I guess I've probably been by there eight or ten times now and have talked to the neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| and I think it's interesting that they signed a petition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4286)|
| 1:11:29| I think this is one of those classics where at least one of the neighbors is agreeing to whoever they're talking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4289)|
| 1:11:35| because I got told they were against this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| So, you know, I don't know what to make of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| The other interesting thing about looking at it is some of the level of what Mr. Allen talked about is not just the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4300)|
| 1:11:48| the top of the roof, but the line of where the windows are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| And it's significant looking at it just to speak a little more long on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| because down the road from me there were a couple new houses built maybe five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4317)|
| 1:12:01| And I always looked at these houses and I said, those are really pretty houses, but they don't look right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| You know, I'd look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| I'd go by and I'd just look at the house and it was really a pretty house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4327)|
| 1:12:11| And in context, it didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| And I didn't realize the problem until the problem was they were built way too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| And it broke up a line of where things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| I think the significant thing is that, and I guess, Mr. Allen, you actually had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| or I guess John Allen had a drawing he had done looking at where the gutter line of this house is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4343)|
| 1:12:30| which is, or no, the gutter line of the adjacent houses is sort of at the bottom here for the windows of this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4350)|
| 1:12:35| So there's a level at which I found kind of a different take from what you got looking at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4355)|
| 1:12:41| was seeing a little more clearly what the problems were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| But I do value going to look at houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| I think sometimes it takes a while to figure out what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4368)|
| 1:12:51| And I'm glad I've been involved a lot in the intro housing guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| that I sort of get why something that I think looks good doesn't look good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| because of a scale or a foundation height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| So there's been some advantage to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4382)|
| 1:13:08| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| I'm going to go to Councilman Hall, and then I'll go to Ms. Riley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| Well, you know, listening to this, you know, about the part about asking for permission or forgiveness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4392)|
| 1:13:20| I do have a little bit of knowledge of the building profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4400)|
| 1:13:23| And I sort of have to agree with what's been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4403)|
| 1:13:27| that probably raising the foundation of this house up higher probably cost him more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4407)|
| 1:13:33| than to doing a little bit of excavation at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| because we're not talking about that large of a space to do the excavation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4416)|
| 1:13:40| And I guess my problem with this, more than any of these other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4420)|
| 1:13:44| about the height of the foundation, the pitch of the roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| is the fact that we passed something here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| and somebody goes out and they submit their plans and they go through the proper process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4431)|
| 1:13:57| to get an approval to build something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| and nobody in the city until it got built said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4440)|
| 1:14:08| this ain't the way this is supposed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4448)|
| 1:14:10| I think if we're going to put all these rules and regulations on these various communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| we do need to put something in place that at least a plans reviewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| or somebody before they issue the permit throws up a flag and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4461)|
| 1:14:25| hey, you do realize that you have to do this, this, and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4465)|
| 1:14:29| Like what Mr. Reynolds stated, they did have part of that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4469)|
| 1:14:34| I just don't think it was all there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| Because I don't think a builder would build a house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4477)|
| 1:14:40| would take the risk intentionally up front that he might have to tear this thing down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4480)|
| 1:14:45| And that's sort of what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| And I just don't see somebody doing that intentionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4488)|
| 1:14:52| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| You know, I think the other thing to consider here, and, again, I'm not a builder or an architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| but building standards have changed in terms of the requirements that the city has for drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4497)|
| 1:15:04| and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| And I believe Mr. Fabian said that the house that was on this property before had rotted out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4505)|
| 1:15:10| It had drainage problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4510)|
| 1:15:11| And so I didn't look at the windows, Councilman Becker, when I was out there today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4511)|
| 1:15:16| but I recognize that the city wants to issue a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4516)|
| 1:15:21| and a builder wants to build a house that's going to stay dry, that's going to be well built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| And that may be incompatible at times in an infill situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4525)|
| 1:15:32| with building a new house to new codes that looks like the ones next to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4532)|
| 1:15:36| if they were built at a different time in history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4536)|
| 1:15:38| when different codes were in effect regarding drainage and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| So I don't know how we deal with that on infill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| You know, if there had been better communication on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| this house might have required a variance to accommodate good building practices and drainage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4548)|
| 1:15:54| I don't know that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4554)|
| 1:15:57| But you've got to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4560)|
| 1:16:01| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4561)|
| 1:16:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4563)|
| 1:16:04| Right now there's not a motion on the floor, unless I'm mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| Is that right, Ms. Mitchell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| There is no motion on the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| I'll give this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4572)|
| 1:16:13| Mr. Batley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| Yeah, Mayor, I would support Councilman Roddy's suggestion that maybe we take a post,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| have a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| And I know Mr. Allen said that he had tried to call the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4580)|
| 1:16:27| and to Mr. Fabian to see if whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| and maybe they could get together and look at some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| I tend to agree with a number of things that other council members have said in terms of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4598)|
| 1:16:44| I don't think he did this intentionally and, you know, to take the risk to possibly have to tear it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4604)|
| 1:16:52| You know, I'm wondering how it went so long without some of the officials taking notice of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4612)|
| 1:16:58| But I've heard some discussions about more dirt, and I'm wondering if that wouldn't cause more problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4618)|
| 1:17:05| But I think there's some solutions to what is a bad situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4625)|
| 1:17:10| and I think maybe if they got together that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4630)|
| 1:17:14| I think they're all trying to accomplish the same thing, that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4634)|
| 1:17:18| something might positively come out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| I would support a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| Right now there's still no motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4646)|
| 1:17:32| Let me ask a question of the parties here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| Mr. Fabian and a representative from Fountain City, not Fountain City, from Lonsdale United for Change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4655)|
| 1:17:43| And I should know your name, young man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4663)|
| 1:17:44| I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4664)|
| 1:17:45| James Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4665)|
| 1:17:46| James Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4666)|
| 1:17:47| And congratulations on being appointed to the P&I board also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4667)|
| 1:17:49| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| Do you guys think there's any benefit to you guys talking over this next couple of weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4673)|
| 1:18:00| We feel kind of like as a neighborhood organization that this situation is out of our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4680)|
| 1:18:09| I mean, if neighborhoods can overturn and change laws and overlays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4689)|
| 1:18:15| and guidelines that are put in place per individual request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4695)|
| 1:18:21| then I think we're really compromising our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4701)|
| 1:18:24| Because if this was my uncle's house, if this was a member of Lonsdale United for Change's house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4704)|
| 1:18:30| if this was anyone else's house, we would be up here doing the same process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4710)|
| 1:18:35| So we spoke with both Mr. Wiggler and Mr. Fabian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4715)|
| 1:18:42| and no compromise was offered except really accepting what the architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4722)|
| 1:18:50| and the construction engineer had presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| And to me, those papers, they do talk about R1 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4733)|
| 1:19:04| but there is no mention of the IH1 overlay in either one of those paperworks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4744)|
| 1:19:09| or anything regarding the IH1 overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4749)|
| 1:19:12| And also to, I think, Mr. Hall, if a building permit is applied for in Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4752)|
| 1:19:19| there is a red flag that it is raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| That paperwork is pulled, and the individual applicant is set down with MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4762)|
| 1:19:29| and gone over the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| In an IH1 zoning overlay, the plans that are submitted are to be the plans built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4771)|
| 1:19:37| In this case, it is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| Which part of your statement is not the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| The plans that were submitted was not the home that was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| In an IH1 overlay, the plans that are submitted are the plans that are to be built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| The builder submitted one plan, build another house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4792)|
| 1:19:57| Well, I've been in the construction business for about 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4797)|
| 1:20:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4801)|
| 1:20:02| And worked all over to the southeast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| And I've never saw a building built that was built exactly to the plans that were submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4804)|
| 1:20:14| There's always changes that are made either by the owner, the tenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4814)|
| 1:20:20| or the whatever the building authority is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| There's always something that is changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| and that's the reason that they do make notes on plans and do make changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4832)|
| 1:20:33| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4833)|
| 1:20:35| Now, granted, I don't build houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4835)|
| 1:20:38| I build commercial buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| And it's a lot more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| There is no, on the plans I look at, there's nothing that says an elevation that's a minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4843)|
| 1:20:51| It's, you know, that's what they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| But I don't think that's what we, I don't disagree with your point of view that you all want a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4854)|
| 1:21:03| and we voted to approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4863)|
| 1:21:05| I just feel like my concern is that we, maybe on the city's part, I don't know who's at fault here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4865)|
| 1:21:12| but I just feel like that somebody, the system was let down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4872)|
| 1:21:19| It didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| And whether it's because it's the first one and it didn't go all the way through, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4880)|
| 1:21:27| I just feel like that something's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4887)|
| 1:21:30| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| There is lack of enforcement for this issue, but this is not the first case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4891)|
| 1:21:39| I have represented my neighborhood organization on more than one occasion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4899)|
| 1:21:46| for inappropriate housing being done in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| And this commission has been very, I mean, this council has been very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| very supportive of protecting Knoxville's inner city neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| And these overlays are basically, the reason people move to West Knoxville is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| because their property values are protected because of the subdivision that they live in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4921)|
| 1:22:05| There is no type of protection for that in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4925)|
| 1:22:09| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| The IH1 zoning overlay now protects homeowners in the city of Knoxville's property values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4930)|
| 1:22:16| to determine what can be built adjacent, across the street, next door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4936)|
| 1:22:21| what can be built in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4941)|
| 1:22:23| If there's the inconsistencies of Lonsdale are, I mean, we have one of Knoxville's oldest neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4943)|
| 1:22:32| one of Knoxville's most historic neighborhoods, but we also have a neighborhood that has been raped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| and pillaged by builders seeking maximum profitability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4957)|
| 1:22:42| And with this overlay, our property values in this area are now protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4962)|
| 1:22:46| And to compromise this overlay is, I mean, compromising MPC's decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4966)|
| 1:22:51| compromising the hard work of the infill design review committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4971)|
| 1:22:54| compromising the hard work of the citizens of Lonsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| where these guidelines were just brought to about as suggestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| and through our hard work for the last three years have been passed into ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| And I just don't, to be honest, I just don't see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4986)|
| 1:23:11| I don't see how people are supposed to invest in Knoxville's inner city neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4991)|
| 1:23:17| when their property values are not protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=4997)|
| 1:23:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| Ms. Roddy, and then I'll come back to the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5002)|
| 1:23:24| I have a question for Mr. Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5004)|
| 1:23:27| If Mr. Fabian were to change this house somehow, and he has agreed to change the slope of the roof,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5007)|
| 1:23:35| that, I guess, is not a sufficient compromise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| What else would you ask, in a perfect world, for him to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5020)|
| 1:23:44| In a perfect world, we would ask that the foundation height be consistent with the early homes of Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5024)|
| 1:23:50| And be consistent with the homes neighboring and across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| And I'm trying to, again, not being a builder or an architect, I'm trying to make that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5035)|
| 1:24:00| I'm trying to understand how that can work with a house that doesn't have water running underneath it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| I'm looking at the testimony in the minutes that are in our packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| from when you and he both spoke at the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| And Mr. Fabian says that when I went to get the plans, they told me I could do no excavating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5053)|
| 1:24:21| I had a surveyor do the plot plan, and we've talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5061)|
| 1:24:24| He shot the minimum, which is 109, and to get the heat and air underneath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| You know, when I read through his testimony here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5069)|
| 1:24:32| in his conversations with buildings and plan reviews and inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5072)|
| 1:24:38| the foundation could be any lower and have the house stay dry and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5078)|
| 1:24:43| And I understand aesthetically wanting the roof to match, which I think he's willing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| And I understand aesthetically wanting the foundation to be level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| But we also want the final owners of this house to have a house that's not going to have problems with mold and mildew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5091)|
| 1:24:58| And that's the part, I guess, where I rely on some testimony from a third-party individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5098)|
| 1:25:04| And assuming this Mr. Rabun, who came out and is an architect and looked at it and evaluated it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5104)|
| 1:25:11| he seems to indicate as well that the way the house is being built on this foundation is going to make a solidly built house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5111)|
| 1:25:19| And that to try to excavate, to artificially lower the foundation so that it matches the facades along the street doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5119)|
| 1:25:28| And he lists the reasons for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| So I'm trying to understand how we can reconcile your desires and putting a livable house on this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5130)|
| 1:25:41| Mr. Allen, let me clear up a couple things real quick, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5141)|
| 1:25:45| I mean, it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5145)|
| 1:25:46| At the MPC meeting, Mr. Fabian said, I was told I couldn't excavate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| And it flew at everybody, the permitting office, MPC, nobody could figure out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5150)|
| 1:25:56| Finally, apparently what happened is he went in at some point early in the process and was talking to Jeff Archer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5156)|
| 1:26:01| who chairs the Info-Housing Committee, and the plan he was saying is he wants to build a bench.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5161)|
| 1:26:06| I mean, he wants to level, wanted to level the lot from the front straight on back to have a wall behind his house of dirt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5166)|
| 1:26:14| wanted to build a bench, and was told, no, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| And he heard, I can't excavate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| Now, I think Jeff Archer is a good communicator, but in this case he said something that Mr. Fabian didn't hear correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5179)|
| 1:26:26| So there never was anything that said you can't excavate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| He was told he couldn't build a bench, and I think he heard more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5189)|
| 1:26:34| The other thing, just interestingly, Mr. Rabin's piece, I have a lot of worry about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5194)|
| 1:26:41| You know, I was reading this after actually I left, looking at the house today, and there's the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5201)|
| 1:26:47| I went and I personally looked at the residence and et cetera, et cetera, and here on the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| I was kind of hoping he would be here, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5213)|
| 1:26:55| He says, at present there are three courses of block visible at the rear of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5215)|
| 1:27:00| And I had just been there, and I hadn't counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5220)|
| 1:27:02| So I drove back by, and there were five to seven courses of block visible on the back of the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5222)|
| 1:27:08| And it seems to me, I mean, his point is you're going to fill two of those with fill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5228)|
| 1:27:12| and, oh, my God, you're going to almost be on the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| Well, if you have three, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| If you have seven, you've got a huge amount of room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5236)|
| 1:27:19| I know if you were looking at it, there's a lot of block visible in the back of that house right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5239)|
| 1:27:24| So, again, I'm a little worried about, you know, this statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| If the man can't count how many rows of blocks there are, I don't know how good an engineer he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5248)|
| 1:27:33| And, you know, it's not a particularly complicated process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5253)|
| 1:27:37| So there's some of that I'm worried about, and I wanted to clear that up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5257)|
| 1:27:42| especially the excavation thing, just because that took me three to five weeks to figure out what had happened on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5262)|
| 1:27:49| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5269)|
| 1:27:50| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5270)|
| 1:27:51| Mr. Allen, earlier I asked Mr. Wiggler and Mr. Fabian a couple of fairly tough questions about reasonable maximum height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5271)|
| 1:28:00| and also the precedent of asking forgiveness as opposed to permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| Let me pose a couple of questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5284)|
| 1:28:07| Basically, what you're saying or what you're asking or your position is that with regards to the ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5287)|
| 1:28:14| and the infill guidelines, you want us to strictly adhere to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5297)|
| 1:28:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5298)|
| 1:28:19| Anywhere in your understanding on how we should apply this, is there any room in your logic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5299)|
| 1:28:26| or in your arguments for innocent or inadvertent mistake in scenarios like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5306)|
| 1:28:31| And taking that against the backdrop that sometimes you have to have variances or change ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5311)|
| 1:28:37| or make exceptions for innocent or inadvertent mistakes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| or are you just basically saying strict application of the ordinance in all situations and at all times?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5320)|
| 1:28:47| I do support strict application, but I do understand that, you know, things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5327)|
| 1:28:55| But when you're dealing with an issue of this magnitude and you're dealing with surrounding neighbors' property values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5335)|
| 1:29:01| that are climbing to put negative development in this area brings down their property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5341)|
| 1:29:07| And this, I mean, this, you know, it may, you know, this may not be affecting us until 10, 15, 20 years down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5347)|
| 1:29:16| I mean, until someone goes to sell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| But it will affect their property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5362)|
| 1:29:24| You know, this, and I'll have other questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| This is just an unfortunate set of circumstances, it sounds like, to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5368)|
| 1:29:33| that there's been some possible breakdown in communication that puts us in an interesting juxtaposition here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5373)|
| 1:29:43| And I am not sure, and we had a suggestion earlier, and I don't know if it makes any sense to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5383)|
| 1:29:47| and look at it because I still think there are some issues here that even visually looking at the homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5387)|
| 1:29:53| or looking at the building is not going to resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| And that's the whole issue of what happened here with kind of the communication situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5395)|
| 1:29:59| and how do we resolve this scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| And quite frankly, I am not sure what the best answer is here, you know, in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5402)|
| 1:30:09| This is a tough one, but hopefully both sides will understand that this council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5409)|
| 1:30:14| at least I am struggling mightily with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| Councilman Hall made some very good points here, and so did Councilman Becker and Councilmember Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5416)|
| 1:30:22| And, you know, this scenario is unfortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5422)|
| 1:30:28| I want to ask some more questions, but I don't have them of you or Mr. Fabian or your attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5428)|
| 1:30:34| I have them of other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5436)|
| 1:30:37| Thank you, Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5439)|
| 1:30:40| Mr. Allen, I want to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| Do you know the approximate value of the surrounding homes, say, left and right of this house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| I know that a home diagonally, two homes that were built at the end of Delaware and. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5447)|
| 1:30:55| Just an average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| We had two brand-new construction homes built and sold for $109,000 in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5457)|
| 1:31:02| There has approximately been, I think, three to four homes sold for over $100,000 in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5462)|
| 1:31:08| Lower and upper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5468)|
| 1:31:13| I'm just trying to get an average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5473)|
| 1:31:14| I mean, you're looking low end, probably nowadays $40,000 to what we're getting almost consistently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5474)|
| 1:31:24| $80,000 to $90,000 to $100,000 to $110,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5484)|
| 1:31:28| New homes or renovated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| New homes and renovated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| I'm certain a new house, like the pictures I'm looking at, this stands out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5493)|
| 1:31:38| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5498)|
| 1:31:40| But you said it was a negative development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5503)|
| 1:31:44| And I'm just wondering, Mr. Fodby, what are you going to ask this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| What's the price on this house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5507)|
| 1:31:49| Sir, we got it on the market for $112,500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5509)|
| 1:31:52| It's going to have shakes on it, vinyl sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5512)|
| 1:31:57| I favor overlays in neighborhoods like this because you want to, exactly what Mr. Allen said, you want to encourage development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5517)|
| 1:32:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5525)|
| 1:32:06| And you want to maintain the character of the neighborhoods and consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5526)|
| 1:32:10| And I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5530)|
| 1:32:11| And I'm trying to figure out here the intent of why we passed this overlay and how this is going to violate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5531)|
| 1:32:19| And I know there's no landscaping, the aesthetics, you know, it stands out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5539)|
| 1:32:25| But I'm just trying to really put some common sense on where we are, what participation the city had in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5545)|
| 1:32:33| because I think we do share some of the blame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5556)|
| 1:32:37| And so I just wanted to get those numbers out there and a few other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5557)|
| 1:32:42| And it is going to be a beautiful house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| Like I say, it is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5566)|
| 1:32:47| I think Ms. Pelow is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| Yes, I just had a sense that maybe Ms. Cash would like to make a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5569)|
| 1:32:54| Am I correct, Ms. Cash?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| Can you shed any light on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| I think Council Member Becker kind of answered my question because we, the Enfield Housing Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5579)|
| 1:33:08| I serve as a member of that committee and I was not present at the first meeting when the original certificate was issued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5588)|
| 1:33:16| However, prior to the second meeting, Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Archer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5596)|
| 1:33:21| and I sat down with Mr. Fabian and helped him work on his plan to try to remediate this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5601)|
| 1:33:29| And I was present at the second meeting and we did talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5609)|
| 1:33:34| Council Member Becker was there and I believe Mr. Allen and some other individuals were also there that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5614)|
| 1:33:40| And if I remember correctly, it was Mr. Donaldson who made the recommendation that he do some excavation to try to remedy this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5620)|
| 1:33:52| I wanted to also explain how this process works just a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5632)|
| 1:33:57| To make an application to go to the Enfield Housing Committee, that application is made at the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5637)|
| 1:34:05| And then that Enfield Housing Committee meets to issue that Certificate of Appropriateness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5645)|
| 1:34:13| You must have, as Mr. Allen stated earlier, once that Certificate of Appropriateness is issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5653)|
| 1:34:20| those plans are what are used to get your building permit with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5660)|
| 1:34:25| Our Plans Review staff does not see any of this until after it has gone through the Enfield Housing Committee and has been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5665)|
| 1:34:33| So I think there's, I just was shocked when somebody said that he was told he couldn't do excavation because, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5673)|
| 1:34:41| I wasn't there the first meeting, but I was there the second meeting and that's not what was expressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5681)|
| 1:34:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| Let's see, I'm going to go over here to Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| I think I'm going to hold for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| Okay, Mr. Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5695)|
| 1:34:57| Mr. Allen, I didn't quite understand what you said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| Did you actually meet with the builder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| Yes, we received a call today at 115 trying to schedule a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5704)|
| 1:35:08| Like I said, I tried to contact as many members of Lonsdale United for Change as I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5708)|
| 1:35:14| You did meet with him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| Yes, we did meet this afternoon at 5 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| And like I said, only my uncle and myself and Mr. Fabian and Mr. Wiggler were present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5719)|
| 1:35:26| Like I said, I couldn't get as many members as I would like of Lonsdale United for Change there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| But during the meeting, it was five to ten minutes, and it was pretty brief and to the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5731)|
| 1:35:40| Is there any value in having another meeting with more members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5740)|
| 1:35:47| I agree with your point of view, and I live in a community that's similar to your own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5747)|
| 1:35:53| But given this situation, is there value in postponing this and bringing more neighbors in and talking with this gentleman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5753)|
| 1:36:03| I think that if we had sat down, if an attempt had been made maybe like early next week or early last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5763)|
| 1:36:12| and we had been sitting down for, you know, entire weeks and meetings and meetings and meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5772)|
| 1:36:17| and we couldn't come to a conclusion, I would say yes, maybe a postponement is deemed necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5777)|
| 1:36:24| But for the fact that I get a call at 115 for the first attempt of trying to make, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5784)|
| 1:36:30| an appointment with Lonsdale United for Change or with the neighborhood organization, kind of show, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5790)|
| 1:36:39| I guess the feeling of our committee was, you know, it's just trying to save face| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| and not really concerned with, you know, what our neighborhood, you know, is about or trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5804)|
| 1:36:50| So if this appeal is denied, what do you think is going to happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| Hopefully the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| And what would that be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| Hopefully the house will be built in compliance with the housing guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5822)|
| 1:37:04| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5825)|
| 1:37:06| I want to ask Mr. Donaldson, you know, MPC staffs the infill housing committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5826)|
| 1:37:13| This was considered once after the house was built by the infill housing committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5833)|
| 1:37:20| and was a decision made there not to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| It was heard at MPC, and it was a decision made there not to change this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5843)|
| 1:37:30| I guess I want to ask you a little bit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| and there have been a lot of concerns about how builders are informed of the infill housing guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what happens there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| When somebody comes in and says, I'm building a house in the infill housing area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5861)|
| 1:37:47| what happens for the person to know what they're supposed to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| How is that communicated to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5871)|
| 1:37:53| Well, the first point of contact is usually up at permitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5873)|
| 1:37:57| and if someone asks for a permit within an area identified as the overlay, they're sent down to our floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5877)|
| 1:38:05| They meet with Jeff Archer, who is the staff person assigned to the infill housing committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5885)|
| 1:38:12| He reviews what's required as far as the submittal on the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5892)|
| 1:38:17| one part of which is a site plan, which shows the finished floor elevation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5897)|
| 1:38:23| and they also are required to submit elevations of the proposed home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5903)|
| 1:38:29| We then schedule a meeting with the infill housing design review committee, which meets regularly once a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5909)|
| 1:38:35| but we will meet in special called meetings if time is of the essence, and we have on several occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5915)|
| 1:38:43| but we try to hold it to a regular monthly meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| whereupon the committee reviews the plans and the application that have been submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5927)|
| 1:38:55| usually applies conditions to those plans when issuing a certificate of appropriateness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5935)|
| 1:39:01| or denying a certificate, at which time that action is communicated to the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5941)|
| 1:39:09| and if the certificate of appropriateness is approved, they're then free to apply for a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5949)|
| 1:39:17| So there's a sit-down with somebody at the beginning of the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5957)|
| 1:39:20| and that would be Jeff, who would say, you're in an infill, here's what you should do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5960)|
| 1:39:26| and do they get a copy of the guidelines when they come in, or are they told that's online?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5966)|
| 1:39:30| I know they're available there. Do you know what happens on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| We don't provide them a copy, but we provide them the access via the Internet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5974)|
| 1:39:40| or we go walk through the guidelines with them when filling out an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5980)|
| 1:39:45| We have a mocked-up application, which shows all of the required information on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5985)|
| 1:39:50| Now, I guess Tom Reynolds had a copy of the letter, the certificate of appropriateness letter that he read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5990)|
| 1:39:59| and some things about this were listed and some weren't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| and I'm wondering why some of the things weren't written down on that letter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| and I would assume it was because you have a site plan that they're on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| and am I sort of that the letter is things that are different from the site plan or specified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6009)|
| 1:40:15| but the assumption that the plan is there and you don't need to tell people to do what they've told you they're going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6015)|
| 1:40:22| The site plan and the building elevations are basically attached to the certificate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6022)|
| 1:40:29| and the certificate usually details those special conditions which the committee has attached to the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6029)|
| 1:40:38| that are not specifically shown on the plans, or clarifies what's on the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6038)|
| 1:40:47| So the letter that Tom Reynolds read that didn't say anything about the floor elevation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| would have been attached to the site plan that Mr. Fabian submitted that said this is my floor elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6052)|
| 1:40:58| So you wouldn't say, I mean, it's sort of you could have put a line there that would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| and everything else that's on the site plan, but sort of attached, it's assumed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6062)|
| 1:41:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6066)|
| 1:41:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| A minute ago, Mr. Fabian had something he wanted to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6070)|
| 1:41:13| I'd like to recognize him for that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6075)|
| 1:41:16| I had talked to Mr. Archer when I went to get the plans to do the overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6076)|
| 1:41:23| He gave me a picture with three little houses on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| and told me I need to go through there and change what I was going to change on the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6086)|
| 1:41:31| Well, I went through there and changed on this little house while we was changing and filled out the paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6091)|
| 1:41:36| Then I got a full set of plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6096)|
| 1:41:38| He made me get a full set of plans, and we went through these plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6098)|
| 1:41:41| and changed everything on the house that was going to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6101)|
| 1:41:45| Then Mr. Allen says we have no contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6105)|
| 1:41:50| Well, I talked to Councilman Becker back at the MPC, and we were supposed to get together with him, but we didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6110)|
| 1:41:57| Me and Mr. Becker, I think he went out of town or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| and so they never got with us when Mr. Becker got back out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6120)|
| 1:42:05| It was two days before the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| And then the meeting that we had, the second meeting that we had at MPC about my case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6127)|
| 1:42:13| I called because they were going to hold a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6133)|
| 1:42:16| Well, when I called, they told me it was going to be on Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| Well, I go up there on Wednesday, and they held a meeting on Tuesday, and nobody called me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6140)|
| 1:42:25| And like I said, I've made several attempts to get a hold of Mr. Allen, but I couldn't get a hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6145)|
| 1:42:31| And I went through the neighborhood and talked to some of the members that's on his committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6151)|
| 1:42:36| and they have signed some of these petitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6156)|
| 1:42:38| But I've tried to go through the regulation, through the whole thing, the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| just like when I was told they was going to try to help me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6163)|
| 1:42:46| Then when I get to MPC, they had told them to deny me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6166)|
| 1:42:51| So when a man says he's going to help you, try to help you, then turn around and tell you, you know, they're going to deny you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6171)|
| 1:42:56| I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| And I've done my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6178)|
| 1:43:00| It's going to be a beautiful home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6180)|
| 1:43:02| I've not hurt nobody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6182)|
| 1:43:03| I would never go over there and try to hurt anybody intentionally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6183)|
| 1:43:06| And there have been a few stories told me, just like the grading, the excavating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6186)|
| 1:43:11| I was told that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6191)|
| 1:43:13| And I told Mr. Reynolds that when I went to his office, because when I went to tear the original house down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6193)|
| 1:43:18| I was told the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| When I tore that house down, I couldn't change the lay of that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6200)|
| 1:43:24| Then me and Mr. Wiggler went up to the city engineer, and the city engineer told me and Mr. Wiggler that that was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6204)|
| 1:43:31| That excavation was for your footers, that I couldn't excavate that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| And I was told that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6215)|
| 1:43:36| I would have never said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6219)|
| 1:43:40| I'm not sure who was next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| I'll go to Mr. Becker and then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6221)|
| 1:43:43| So, Mr. Favio, let me just understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6223)|
| 1:43:45| You went in to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6225)|
| 1:43:46| You sat down with Jeff Archer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6226)|
| 1:43:48| He gave you the three drawings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6228)|
| 1:43:50| You filled it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6230)|
| 1:43:51| Then you came back with your plans, and you worked on them with him again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6231)|
| 1:43:55| So you had two meetings with Mr. Archer before you got your certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| When I got up there, I took the wrong thing to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| It took three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6242)|
| 1:44:04| So he told me to come back with five sets of plans and mark them like I did those small houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| because what I did on those small houses, I didn't mark trees on those small houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6249)|
| 1:44:15| And what I'd done was I just put the measurement of the driveway in the back of the house on those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6255)|
| 1:44:21| Well, he called me back three weeks later and said that I couldn't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6261)|
| 1:44:24| I had to bring the plans and bring the plans up there and draw it on the plans, draw the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6264)|
| 1:44:28| And so I took them up there, and he drew all the trees for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| Then me and Mr. Archer and Mr. Reynolds here sat down and talked on two or three occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6271)|
| 1:44:40| And Mr. Reynolds here helped me change the drawings on my house to make it right, to try to make it right, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6280)|
| 1:44:48| And I've called you several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6288)|
| 1:44:50| I've called the engineer people several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6290)|
| 1:44:52| And I've tried to do what's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| Well, let me ask you, you met with Jeff at least twice and Tom and Jeff at least once before you got their certificate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6294)|
| 1:45:01| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6301)|
| 1:45:02| I met with Jeff one time to do the little houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6302)|
| 1:45:04| He sat me down up there and turned around and walked off and left me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6304)|
| 1:45:07| So I went and drawed all I could do on those plans of what we had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6307)|
| 1:45:11| Then when he came back, Mr. Archer told me that the committee looked at my drawings and said I was really detailed about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6311)|
| 1:45:19| They really liked it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| Like I say, I met with Mr. Archer once when I first went up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| Then I met with him when I took these plans back up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| Then when we took these plans up there, I just turned him into the front desk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6328)|
| 1:45:31| So when did you sit down with Mr. Reynolds and do all the work on the plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| I was called that I had Mr. Lowe come out on the job site we was working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| This was after you got the certificate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6339)|
| 1:45:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6341)|
| 1:45:42| Now, I have a quick question for your attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| And this is sort of about Mr. Allen's concern about when you called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6344)|
| 1:45:47| Two weeks ago, we stood out in the lobby there, and you said you wanted a postponement so you could talk to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6347)|
| 1:45:54| And you got Mr. Allen's phone number right then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| Why did it take you until today at 115 to call him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6357)|
| 1:46:03| We got the certificate or the letter from the surveyor just a few days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6363)|
| 1:46:12| And I did intend to call him earlier and should have gotten to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| On this issue, though, it's clear that the only thing that would satisfy Mr. Allen is lowering the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6376)|
| 1:46:23| And the only thing that Mr. Fabian cannot do reasonably is lower the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6383)|
| 1:46:30| So I don't think that further discussions, and I think Mr. Allen would agree, that further discussions on that particular topic could be fruitful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6390)|
| 1:46:39| I don't believe they would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6399)|
| 1:46:42| We've offered to change the roof pitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6402)|
| 1:46:44| We've offered to regrade the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| We need a new permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6407)|
| 1:46:48| We'd get that approved by city engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| We've offered to put a flower bed in below the window that would diminish greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6411)|
| 1:46:56| I think 14 inches of a flower bed would diminish the amount of exposed block that would show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6416)|
| 1:47:02| We can raise the front grading of the front yard 16 to 24 inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6422)|
| 1:47:09| And I think, according to Tom, that would be in compliance with the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6429)|
| 1:47:15| That would be in compliance with the plans as drawn and as approved by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6435)|
| 1:47:22| Now, real quick, Ms. Riley, the plan that you want to do is the one that Perry Childress developed back, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6442)|
| 1:47:31| for the infill committee meeting March, February, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6451)|
| 1:47:37| And, granted, you didn't have your three sentences on this until the day before yesterday, maybe Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6457)|
| 1:47:45| Did you try and sit down with the neighborhood with the plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6465)|
| 1:47:47| Have you ever sat down with the neighborhood with the plans that Perry Childress drew up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6467)|
| 1:47:53| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6473)|
| 1:47:54| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6474)|
| 1:47:58| Mr. Reynolds, you wanted to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| Thank you, Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| I would just like to bring a couple of issues to the forehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6482)|
| 1:48:06| Some of you all have dealt with me on other projects and stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| and I usually try to remain completely neutral and impartial about any issue that's in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6489)|
| 1:48:15| dealing in facts because that's really what it boils down to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| Anything that I do or approve or make a judgment call on is usually highly scrutinized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6499)|
| 1:48:25| and sometimes ends up in litigation, as this one may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| And I have a lot of, I've been allowed to serve the citizens of Knoxville in that capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6510)|
| 1:48:36| and that's the way I want to keep my reputation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6516)|
| 1:48:40| I would just like to say that I've been referred to as saying how maybe he could comply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6520)|
| 1:48:47| I think it would be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6527)|
| 1:48:49| I didn't say that it's going to take some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6529)|
| 1:48:54| Would he backfill and change the foundation exposure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6534)|
| 1:49:00| I think he could, but how?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6540)|
| 1:49:04| And how much would that take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6544)|
| 1:49:05| And he'd have to work through engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6545)|
| 1:49:09| But right now, dealing with the facts that I see them with the permit that I have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| and that's what I've got to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6553)|
| 1:49:16| This, for me, is what I've got to look at when I have to make a judgment as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6556)|
| 1:49:22| or not I'm going to file this permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6562)|
| 1:49:29| And I want to talk to both the contractor and the homeowners in Lonsdale because of what I have here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6569)|
| 1:49:36| and what's approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| If he were to choose to backfill his foundation and meet the foundation exposure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6578)|
| 1:49:48| and somehow that was to comply with engineering for the runoff away from the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6588)|
| 1:49:54| and he was to put a 9-12 pitch on that roof, which he has a legal permit to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6594)|
| 1:50:00| because the letter of appropriateness says that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| they may end up with something much more out of compliance for their neighborhood than what they have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6603)|
| 1:50:12| And I guess the point I want to make is that I think the suggestion that Councilperson Roddy made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6612)|
| 1:50:22| about them sitting down and talking and trying to come to a meeting of the minds about this issue may be very good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6622)|
| 1:50:29| because I'd just like to bring that point out to both the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6629)|
| 1:50:34| because I have feelings for the neighborhood and I have feelings for the contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6634)|
| 1:50:38| because it's just really a bad situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6638)|
| 1:50:40| I'm kind of put in the middle of it at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6640)|
| 1:50:43| But at some point I'm going to have to make a judgment about whether or not to final this permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6643)|
| 1:50:50| And what we could get out of this from what documents I have in front of me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6650)|
| 1:50:58| may not please the community even more so than what they have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6658)|
| 1:51:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6667)|
| 1:51:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6668)|
| 1:51:09| I think Ms. Pelow is next, but I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6669)|
| 1:51:12| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6672)|
| 1:51:13| I just, I had not read the minutes of the appeal until I was sitting here, and I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6673)|
| 1:51:20| I should have read that prior to tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6680)|
| 1:51:22| You know, what I read here in the MPC appeal really disturbs me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6682)|
| 1:51:26| because the statements that are made there are not really in keeping with some of the statements made tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6686)|
| 1:51:35| And that just bothers me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6695)|
| 1:51:37| I can't get my arms around the truth or really the way this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6697)|
| 1:51:43| And it's very unusual for the MPC to deny appeal 14-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6703)|
| 1:51:50| And some of the questions that were asked there are, to me, very significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6710)|
| 1:51:57| Mr. Clancy asked, you got a certificate of appropriateness for the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6717)|
| 1:52:01| and the elevation we are looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| That is what it looked like on the plans when you got your certificate of appropriateness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6723)|
| 1:52:08| Mr. Fabian answered, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| The plans that I have show the site elevations of a flat lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6730)|
| 1:52:15| It did not show a sloping lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6735)|
| 1:52:17| And there are just a number of places on here that just really disturb me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6737)|
| 1:52:21| because I can see people having had their fingers pointed at them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6741)|
| 1:52:29| and yet not all the statements that were made to the individual agencies that were involved were correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6749)|
| 1:52:38| So it really bothers me a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| And Mr. Fabian made a statement here when Mr. Clancy asked further that when you build inside an IH-1 overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6762)|
| 1:52:50| you have to go with the plan as submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6770)|
| 1:52:53| Mr. Fabian said, well, that was my first house over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6773)|
| 1:52:58| And yet I ask you if you knew that you were building in an IH-1 overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6778)|
| 1:53:03| And you said, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| So it's time to go to school, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| And then we go on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6788)|
| 1:53:12| I explained to Mr. Archer that the lot was sloping and the front of the house would be high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6792)|
| 1:53:17| I dug the footers, which is different from excavation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| Mr. Carey said it is not different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| Now, I happen to know Mr. Carey is a well-respected builder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6802)|
| 1:53:27| That was another misunderstanding, Mr. Carey says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| I have done floor elevations in that neighborhood myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6811)|
| 1:53:35| And sometimes you have to go to a little bit more trouble to lower the footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6815)|
| 1:53:40| We are interested in seeing that people go by the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6820)|
| 1:53:44| That was Mr. Carey's comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6824)|
| 1:53:46| And then Mr. Fabian indicated that would have been no trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6826)|
| 1:53:51| They were honest mistakes that I made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6831)|
| 1:53:54| And that was the end of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6834)|
| 1:53:57| The vote was then 14-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| I just wanted to read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| I thought perhaps I was not the only one who had failed to look at those minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6842)|
| 1:54:07| But to me that's very significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6847)|
| 1:54:09| Can I answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6849)|
| 1:54:11| Well, I think this stands on its own because it's the record of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6851)|
| 1:54:15| Vice Mayor Browning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| And this next couple of questions are probably not going to endear me to either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6860)|
| 1:54:27| But, you know, obviously maybe there are more people here that are clear on this whole factual situation than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6867)|
| 1:54:34| I'm kind of reminded of my son when he was very young and I would ask him if something is clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6874)|
| 1:54:38| and he would say clear as mud because this is, you know, not very clear to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6878)|
| 1:54:44| And I've been hesitating asking these couple of questions because I was hoping that, you know, there would be some illumination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6884)|
| 1:54:51| Let me ask you, and I think I asked you earlier, Mr. Fabian, before you broke ground and began to build,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6891)|
| 1:54:57| did you know this was an overlay area, an infill guideline overlay area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6897)|
| 1:55:02| But I went up there to apply for my plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| Did you know before you began building that it was an infill guideline overlay area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6904)|
| 1:55:10| When I got my permit, yes, sir, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| Did you know before you began building that it was an infill guideline overlay area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6912)|
| 1:55:17| Yes, sir. I did when I got my permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6917)|
| 1:55:19| And you were told that by an MPC or someone in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| Yes, sir. I was told by MPC when I went and filed my plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6922)|
| 1:55:26| I thought you said earlier you didn't know, but you did know before you began?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6926)|
| 1:55:29| Well, I went to do my plans and they kept my plan for three weeks and Mr. Archer did call me back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6929)|
| 1:55:34| And when I went up there to get the plan, I just thought it was like doing it in the city on the other side of the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6934)|
| 1:55:39| But you were told it was one and you didn't do any further research as to what that meant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6939)|
| 1:55:43| Well, they gave me the paperwork of what I had on the thing, but it didn't state on there, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6943)|
| 1:55:50| the height of the elevations and stuff, maximum heights. It didn't state all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| I mean, it did not state that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6954)|
| 1:55:56| When he told you that when you found out and was told that this was an infill guideline overlay area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6956)|
| 1:56:01| they didn't peak your interest as a builder to make sure that everything was in compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6961)|
| 1:56:05| everything was consistent with your past experiences as a builder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| Well, I had that guideline like Mr. Reynolds got there and I went by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6969)|
| 1:56:13| I'd done everything by that guideline that I was supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6973)|
| 1:56:17| That's all I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6977)|
| 1:56:18| I didn't have nothing handed to me that was special about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| I had the guidelines of what Mr. Reynolds read here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6981)|
| 1:56:23| That's all I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6983)|
| 1:56:24| So your position is while you were told it was an infill guideline overlay area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6984)|
| 1:56:29| you were somehow given the wrong plans or information about the requirements of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6989)|
| 1:56:33| I didn't have, like he was talking about earlier, the sheets that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6993)|
| 1:56:36| Like he said, sometimes they don't give them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| I didn't get one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=6998)|
| 1:56:40| What I got was when I went to get the permit after going through the three weeks waiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7000)|
| 1:56:45| and having all the plans, taking all the plans up there, then I went and got the permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7005)|
| 1:56:49| and that's what I had, the little three pieces of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7009)|
| 1:56:53| And when you went and got the permit, where did you get that from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| The city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7015)|
| 1:56:56| From the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7016)|
| 1:56:57| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7017)|
| 1:56:58| From Mr. Reynolds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| No, sir, I got it from one of his up there where you apply for your permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7019)|
| 1:57:03| Is that your understanding of the facts of how it occurred, Mr. Reynolds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7023)|
| 1:57:07| Yes, he would specifically what he would receive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| and what he brought would be when he comes to apply for this permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7030)|
| 1:57:14| he would bring the letter of appropriateness from MPC describing the work description as I read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7034)|
| 1:57:19| He's basically saying that although he was told that this is an infill guideline overlay area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7039)|
| 1:57:24| if I heard him correctly, that he was not given the proper information when he came back in three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7044)|
| 1:57:29| Are you agreeing or disagreeing with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7049)|
| 1:57:36| Are you talking about when he came back from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7056)|
| 1:57:38| I'm trying to figure out how you made the mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7058)|
| 1:57:40| If you were told it was an infill guideline overlay area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7060)|
| 1:57:43| you were given the proper information how the mistake was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| Somebody just started building and didn't just look at the plans or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7066)|
| 1:57:51| Well, I had the permit, brother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| On there it had the three pages that I read what you had to do when I filled out on these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7073)|
| 1:57:59| This was all filled out on the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7079)|
| 1:58:02| Are you saying that the city gave you the wrong permit information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7082)|
| 1:58:06| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7086)|
| 1:58:07| The MPC, when we went to the MPC to get to where we're going, we did these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7087)|
| 1:58:12| I had to sign off on those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| It took five weeks to get the building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7094)|
| 1:58:17| I had to go out after the three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| I had to go out and post a sign on the lot stating that we was going in the infill housing unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7099)|
| 1:58:25| And I read the three pages that I had, which it was like Mr. Reynolds had read out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7105)|
| 1:58:29| I didn't have nothing from MPC stating elevations or none of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7109)|
| 1:58:35| And so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| Mr. Dawson, he said he didn't get what he should have gotten from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7118)|
| 1:58:41| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7121)|
| 1:58:42| I didn't get the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| All I got was the papers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7125)|
| 1:58:46| Jeff Archer took this down to the codes office for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7126)|
| 1:58:51| He had delivered the paperwork down to the codes office, to the ladies down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7131)|
| 1:58:55| And I went down there and got the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7135)|
| 1:58:57| And all I got was the permit and the paperwork that Mr. Reynolds had gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7137)|
| 1:59:03| Mr. Dawson, who's responsible for getting that information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7143)|
| 1:59:06| Is MPC responsible to give it to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7146)|
| 1:59:08| Or is he responsible as a developer to go and research that information based on your understanding of the process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7148)|
| 1:59:15| When we would have given him a copy of the certificate of appropriateness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7155)|
| 1:59:21| we also provide a copy of that to the permitting department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7161)|
| 1:59:26| and a copy of the plot plan and the building elevations that were submitted as part of the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7166)|
| 1:59:33| And he asked to build according to the plans that were submitted for the application and approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7173)|
| 1:59:39| He said he did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7179)|
| 1:59:40| Hold on, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7180)|
| 1:59:41| And so you all did that, but he just didn't build according to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7181)|
| 1:59:44| Is that your understanding of what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7184)|
| 1:59:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7187)|
| 1:59:48| The two issues that we've talked about this evening, the certificate identified a 9-12 pitch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7188)|
| 1:59:55| which was what the drawing on the elevation showed, but was scratched out and put 5-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7195)|
| 2:00:03| And then it was bent to 4-12, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7203)|
| 2:00:06| And tell me about the foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| The application requires that the finished floor elevation be identified on the plot plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7208)|
| 2:00:14| That was identified on the plan at 1-09.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7214)|
| 2:00:18| And after the stop work order was issued,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7218)|
| 2:00:21| we asked that a surveyor go out there to confirm what the actual floor elevation was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7221)|
| 2:00:27| and it turned out it was 1-10.7, which is, you know, the foot and a half that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7227)|
| 2:00:36| Do you have any idea how that happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7236)|
| 2:00:38| Are you saying that you just made a mistake in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7238)|
| 2:00:41| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7241)|
| 2:00:42| We went to the 1-09 as the minimum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| And then when I got the stop work order ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7244)|
| 2:00:46| You took 1-09 as the minimum and decided to build the 1-10 and a half or whatever it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7246)|
| 2:00:51| Well, we raised the house up, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| We didn't have enough space underneath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7253)|
| 2:00:54| See, I've done it by code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7254)|
| 2:00:56| By code, you've got to have 18 inches of clearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7258)|
| 2:00:59| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| You know, I'm just trying to make sure I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7262)|
| 2:01:03| And I went back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7263)|
| 2:01:04| You've heard an awful lot tonight, and I apologize if I'm not having caught up with everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7264)|
| 2:01:08| But I'm just trying to make sure what you knew, when you knew it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7268)|
| 2:01:11| and then what went into your decision on how this ended up getting built the way it was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7271)|
| 2:01:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7276)|
| 2:01:17| And part of it you say is a mistake, and part of it is you're saying you made a ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7277)|
| 2:01:20| I made the mistake on the roof pitch, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7280)|
| 2:01:22| But you made a choice to build the foundation higher for flooding issues or whatever those were you said there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7282)|
| 2:01:28| When you're out there in a lot, it varies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| When you go to a lot to build a house on, you'll have a flat lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| If you've got elevation, I mean, you've got to take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7295)|
| 2:01:38| I appreciate all this commentary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7298)|
| 2:01:39| So you made a decision to build it higher than the 109 that you were given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7299)|
| 2:01:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7304)|
| 2:01:45| For whatever reason, you made that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7305)|
| 2:01:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7307)|
| 2:01:49| But I was also the one that sent the surveyor back out to do the additional measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7309)|
| 2:01:54| because Mr. Reynolds asked me what it was with the finished floor elevation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7314)|
| 2:01:58| So I had Mr. Loosky go back out and shoot the floor elevation for us and get us a copy of it sent to Mr. Loosky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7318)|
| 2:02:04| One last thing, Mr. Dawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7324)|
| 2:02:05| The information that you all give him or you give early on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7325)|
| 2:02:09| does it say that in the info guidelines overlay area that it must be built according to the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7329)|
| 2:02:16| Does that informational sheet you just mentioned that you hand out to him or you give to an individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7336)|
| 2:02:21| does it say on there also that these must be built according to plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7341)|
| 2:02:26| I'm not sure if it actually explicitly says that on there or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7346)|
| 2:02:30| If you were to submit a set of plans for approval and we approve those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7350)|
| 2:02:35| No matter if it's in guidelines or not, you're supposed to build those plans, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7355)|
| 2:02:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7359)|
| 2:02:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7360)|
| 2:02:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7361)|
| 2:02:42| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7362)|
| 2:02:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7363)|
| 2:02:44| I know these are pretty rare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7364)|
| 2:02:45| but I'm looking for some pearls of wisdom from the 5th District representative on what to do from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7365)|
| 2:02:54| Would you like to answer the question, or if not, you can make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7374)|
| 2:02:58| You know, my plan with this was not to make a motion, because I think I agree with what MPC did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7378)|
| 2:03:06| If I were to make a motion, it would be to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7386)|
| 2:03:09| That's my tendency of where to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7389)|
| 2:03:12| It's why I've been silent, because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7392)|
| 2:03:15| failure to have a motion is actually a little better parliamentary than a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7395)|
| 2:03:22| So I was moving down that road, and that's where I'd go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7402)|
| 2:03:29| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7409)|
| 2:03:33| Mr. Foley, and to go back to Councilman or Vice Mayor Brown's question and your response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7413)|
| 2:03:38| my understanding is that you just said that you made the conscious choice to raise the foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7418)|
| 2:03:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7426)|
| 2:03:48| And you said you did that in order to get the 18 inches clearance in the crawl space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7428)|
| 2:03:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7432)|
| 2:03:53| Mr. Cary, according to the record from the MPC minutes, the minutes from the MPC meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7433)|
| 2:03:59| Mr. Cary questioned you on that and pointed out Mr. Cary has knowledge in building himself, is in that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7439)|
| 2:04:07| I have a little bit of history myself there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7447)|
| 2:04:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7450)|
| 2:04:12| You could have excavated the crawl space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| Obviously, you could have set your footers and your foundation at a level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7454)|
| 2:04:19| and waterproofed the footers and foundation and taken your drainage to daylight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7459)|
| 2:04:24| to probably take care of any water that might have otherwise penetrated into the crawl space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7464)|
| 2:04:30| and you could have lowered the crawl space floor adequately to give you your 18 inches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7470)|
| 2:04:34| without raising the foundation as you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7474)|
| 2:04:38| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7478)|
| 2:04:39| Well, you've got two choices, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7479)|
| 2:04:40| You either dig out or you raise up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7480)|
| 2:04:43| Yes, but you had the choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7483)|
| 2:04:44| That's exactly what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7484)|
| 2:04:46| You could have dug out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7486)|
| 2:04:47| You could have solved the entire problem that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7487)|
| 2:04:49| Well, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7489)|
| 2:04:50| If you dig down, you're creating a problem underneath the excavate and come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7490)|
| 2:04:54| as they recommended it to me, to excavate, drop the house two blocks and excavate underneath the house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7494)|
| 2:05:00| That was after we'd had the house done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7500)|
| 2:05:03| And we sent Mr. Archer down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| But you could have done that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7505)|
| 2:05:06| Sir, I was told I couldn't excavate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7506)|
| 2:05:09| I was told that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7509)|
| 2:05:11| That was your understanding of what you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| I was told that twice, and we went to the city engineer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7513)|
| 2:05:15| and they told me I couldn't change the elevation of that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7515)|
| 2:05:20| I've heard you say that, but I've also heard from others that have spoken tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7520)|
| 2:05:25| saying they still don't understand where that came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7525)|
| 2:05:28| I believe that's what I. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7528)|
| 2:05:29| Mr. Archer had told me that sitting in Mr. Reynolds' office when we was having the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7529)|
| 2:05:35| I brought it to Mr. Archer's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7535)|
| 2:05:38| In Mr. Reynolds' office, I said, Mr. Archer, you told me I couldn't excavate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7538)|
| 2:05:43| Mr. Reynolds, did you hear Mr. Archer say that he could not excavate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7543)|
| 2:05:48| I don't remember that, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7548)|
| 2:05:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7549)|
| 2:05:52| Well, it's obviously a mess, and there's no easy solution to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7552)|
| 2:05:59| but I tend to agree with Councilman Becker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7559)|
| 2:06:03| and with what I've heard from the folks in the neighborhood, I just. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7563)|
| 2:06:09| If we don't. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7569)|
| 2:06:10| If we have guidelines and we follow the slippery slope of not allowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7570)|
| 2:06:16| not requiring that those guidelines are followed, I don't think it's. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7576)|
| 2:06:22| I think we're going to regret it if we intend to uphold the intent of the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7582)|
| 2:06:28| in the infill housing overlay in this neighborhood or the other two neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7588)|
| 2:06:32| or any future neighborhoods that may have overlays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7592)|
| 2:06:35| and I would anticipate there being more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| So I would really have trouble supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7597)|
| 2:06:42| Well, see, when I drop that block. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7602)|
| 2:06:43| I'm sorry, there's no repartee here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7603)|
| 2:06:52| Okay. Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7612)|
| 2:06:53| Anybody else have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| Mr. Batley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7615)|
| 2:06:56| Yes, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7616)|
| 2:06:58| You know, I've listened to this, and I have strong feelings for the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7618)|
| 2:07:02| and I support the overlay, and I also have feelings for the contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7622)|
| 2:07:07| and I'm really looking at what was intended in this overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7627)|
| 2:07:11| and what is built and property values and consistency and character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7631)|
| 2:07:16| and all those sort of things, and I look at what's built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7636)|
| 2:07:21| and I'm wondering how this went on so long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7641)|
| 2:07:24| and why it wasn't objected to or caught earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7644)|
| 2:07:28| and I've heard all the arguments and who said this and who said that and what if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7648)|
| 2:07:32| and I tend to believe that the contractor didn't try to overt what is intended here of the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7652)|
| 2:07:44| and I'm looking at it, how far it's out of compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7664)|
| 2:07:47| and I'm wondering if, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7667)|
| 2:07:50| if he takes money that he's committed to the roof and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7670)|
| 2:07:55| and he landscapes it and he dresses up the windows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| and he does all those things that he talked about and maybe moves some dirt, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7678)|
| 2:08:02| in the long run, what's it going to look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7682)|
| 2:08:04| And I looked at that property value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7684)|
| 2:08:06| I asked that question earlier, and it was a dangerous question to put him on the spot, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7686)|
| 2:08:11| but he's going to sell the house for at the high end of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| and so I'm one that's going to support this appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7695)|
| 2:08:19| and I know that's, you know, I'm one that supported the overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7699)|
| 2:08:23| but I just feel like, you know, that's, you know, it's a tough situation to be in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7703)|
| 2:08:30| but I think we just need to figure out a way to keep a close eye on these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7710)|
| 2:08:35| and make sure that these guidelines are dealt with more so on the front end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7715)|
| 2:08:40| and followed as we go along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7720)|
| 2:08:42| This is new, and so I'm going to support the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7722)|
| 2:08:47| Right now there's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7727)|
| 2:08:48| And I'll make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7728)|
| 2:08:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7730)|
| 2:08:51| There's a motion to support the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7731)|
| 2:08:52| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7732)|
| 2:08:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7733)|
| 2:08:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7734)|
| 2:08:55| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7735)|
| 2:08:58| Let's clarify the motion, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7738)|
| 2:09:00| The motion is to approve the appeal by Mr. Fabian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7740)|
| 2:09:05| Would that include the things he had talked about doing, like changing the roof?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7745)|
| 2:09:11| And that's the way I'm taking this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7751)|
| 2:09:13| Is all that included in the appeal, that he would change the roof pitch and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7753)|
| 2:09:20| Well, the appeal is, as I understand it, and Mr. Swanson, Mr. Donaldson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7760)|
| 2:09:26| who are closer to this, or Mr. Reynolds, the appeal is actually of both the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7766)|
| 2:09:32| The appeal would be able to allow him to leave the house as it is now and complete it as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7772)|
| 2:09:37| It wouldn't, just like Mr. Bailey's motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7777)|
| 2:09:40| wouldn't necessarily have to build up the dirt in front or do anything different with the roof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7780)|
| 2:09:46| So it could be amended to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7786)|
| 2:09:49| But as it stands, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7789)|
| 2:09:52| Mr. Swanson, is that what you think it needs to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7792)|
| 2:09:55| I think that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7795)|
| 2:09:56| The appeal is both on the roof pitch and on the foundation, whatever the floor elevation is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7796)|
| 2:10:06| and it is to give him a variance so that it is as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7806)|
| 2:10:13| So that's what you would be approving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7813)|
| 2:10:17| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7817)|
| 2:10:20| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7820)|
| 2:10:22| I guess two thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7822)|
| 2:10:26| One is I actually disagree with Mr. Allen about Mr. Fabian's intentions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7826)|
| 2:10:31| I think he tried to build a good house, and there's not necessarily a great system here for communicating things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7831)|
| 2:10:38| Honestly, I've never heard that if the government doesn't inform me about a law, I don't have to follow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7838)|
| 2:10:44| I've never heard that legal theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7844)|
| 2:10:46| It's kind of a cool one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7846)|
| 2:10:47| I actually like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7847)|
| 2:10:49| It doesn't apply to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7849)|
| 2:10:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7850)|
| 2:10:51| Mostly, though, I think some of what Mr. Allen said about setting a precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7851)|
| 2:10:55| about talking about whether we're really serious about protecting neighborhoods is what this is about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7855)|
| 2:11:00| that we've said we want these overlays, we want the guidelines, we want to improve things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7860)|
| 2:11:06| we want to build strong neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7866)|
| 2:11:08| Well, there are tough decisions to be made in doing that, and they do make people unhappy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7868)|
| 2:11:13| I think in this case, there's a house a block and a half away from me in the Oakwood-Lincoln Park overlay that got built wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7873)|
| 2:11:24| I'm sure I haven't talked at all about this one, but I'm sure it's a fellow who submitted plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7884)|
| 2:11:29| and never thought about it and might not have, you know, whatever, and it looks horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7889)|
| 2:11:34| It looks a lot worse than your house, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7894)|
| 2:11:36| It looks kind of like somebody built a trailer in the front yard of a house in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7896)|
| 2:11:41| And I think at some level we establish a precedent if we adopt this appeal of it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7901)|
| 2:11:49| And I think also we say to neighborhoods, no, we're not going to uphold the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7909)|
| 2:11:53| I think we need to uphold the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| I think it's tough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7915)|
| 2:11:56| It's not always fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7916)|
| 2:11:58| But there are plenty of ways for people to find out what the guidelines were and to follow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7918)|
| 2:12:02| So I'm not going to be supporting Mr. Bailey's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7922)|
| 2:12:06| I think we stick with the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7926)|
| 2:12:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7930)|
| 2:12:11| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7931)|
| 2:12:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7933)|
| 2:12:14| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7934)|
| 2:12:15| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7935)|
| 2:12:16| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7936)|
| 2:12:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7937)|
| 2:12:18| After all this time, Ms. Mitchell, why don't you go ahead and call the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7938)|
| 2:12:20| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7940)|
| 2:12:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7941)|
| 2:12:22| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7942)|
| 2:12:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7943)|
| 2:12:24| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7944)|
| 2:12:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7946)|
| 2:12:28| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7948)|
| 2:12:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7949)|
| 2:12:30| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7950)|
| 2:12:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7951)|
| 2:12:32| Councilman Holtquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7952)|
| 2:12:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7953)|
| 2:12:34| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7954)|
| 2:12:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7955)|
| 2:12:36| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7956)|
| 2:12:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7957)|
| 2:12:38| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7958)|
| 2:12:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7959)|
| 2:12:40| A motion fails two to seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7960)|
| 2:12:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7963)|
| 2:12:44| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7964)|
| 2:12:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7966)|
| 2:12:47| Mr. Becker, was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7967)|
| 2:12:48| Can you explain what that means for the audience?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7968)|
| 2:12:51| This has been a long discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7971)|
| 2:12:53| I'll let Mr. Swanson, but I think it means the appeal has been denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7973)|
| 2:12:56| And Mr. Swanson, you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7976)|
| 2:12:59| Absent some other motion, it means the appeal has been denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7979)|
| 2:13:03| That was simple, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7983)|
| 2:13:08| 11A is a resolution requesting and encouraging the executive director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7988)|
| 2:13:12| and the professional staff at the Metropolitan Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7992)|
| 2:13:14| to study, evaluate, and analyze the feasibility and potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7994)|
| 2:13:18| for adopting a comprehensive sidewalk ordinance for the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=7998)|
| 2:13:22| requested by Councilmember Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8002)|
| 2:13:25| Mr. Becker, I see that light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8005)|
| 2:13:27| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| I know at the workshop we kind of ended saying this needs more work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8008)|
| 2:13:32| There were a couple options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8012)|
| 2:13:34| We talked about where to go with this, a lot of support for sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8014)|
| 2:13:37| a lot of desire to get things done right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8017)|
| 2:13:41| Actually, I see Mr. Peterson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8021)|
| 2:13:43| and I guess at some point I'd love to ask him a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8023)|
| 2:13:45| and follow up from the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8025)|
| 2:13:47| But my sense from what I heard was there's sort of two desires that I think can work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8027)|
| 2:13:54| One is that we have a Transportation and Mobility Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8034)|
| 2:13:57| that we set up to deal with issues like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8037)|
| 2:14:00| And I think there was a sense that this committee should be asked to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8040)|
| 2:14:03| There was also sort of a sense of there's some low-hanging fruit out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8043)|
| 2:14:07| There's some simple things we can be doing to massively improve the pedestrian friendliness of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8047)|
| 2:14:18| So I guess what I'd like to suggest is that we postpone this for, I'm going to say, three months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8058)|
| 2:14:24| refer this to the Transportation and Mobility Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8064)|
| 2:14:27| and ask them to come back in three months with some ideas on that low-hanging fruit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8067)|
| 2:14:32| and those sort of simple solutions that we all do agree on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8072)|
| 2:14:35| That's the sense I got from the meeting Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8075)|
| 2:14:41| I'm going to make your three months 12 weeks, if I could do that, just to have it be a council night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8081)|
| 2:14:47| Oh, that actually makes more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8087)|
| 2:14:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8088)|
| 2:14:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8089)|
| 2:14:50| Mr. Hulquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8090)|
| 2:14:51| Well, I see Councilman Bailey has his light on as the co-chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8091)|
| 2:14:56| as the both of us being co-chairs of that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8096)|
| 2:14:59| I will say on my behalf, I hope that he would speak for himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8099)|
| 2:15:03| I'm sure he will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8103)|
| 2:15:04| On my behalf, I think that's appropriate for the committee to take that on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8104)|
| 2:15:10| rather than the referral to MPC at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8110)|
| 2:15:14| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8114)|
| 2:15:15| Mr. Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8115)|
| 2:15:16| I think it's a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8116)|
| 2:15:17| I'm glad to see that we've had a healthy discussion and a good discussion and open this dialogue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8117)|
| 2:15:24| because I think sooner or later it needs to be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8124)|
| 2:15:28| I do think, Chairman Hulquist, that we could come up with some sort of a subcommittee within the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8128)|
| 2:15:36| to then start some sort of discussion and meet with the city on its current policies and process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8136)|
| 2:15:42| and criteria and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8142)|
| 2:15:44| I do think there is some, as someone said earlier, some low-hanging fruit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8144)|
| 2:15:49| some wide streets where some, you know, we wouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8149)|
| 2:15:54| I mean, there's some real good opportunities, I think, there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8154)|
| 2:15:57| So I think that's a good idea, and I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8157)|
| 2:16:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8160)|
| 2:16:01| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8161)|
| 2:16:02| Well, I was just going to comment that I sit on that committee as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8162)|
| 2:16:05| and I definitely concur with Councilman Bailey that it needs to be referred to a subcommittee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8165)|
| 2:16:10| because I really, thinking of the makeup of the entire committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8170)|
| 2:16:14| I'm not confident that it is really of tremendous interest to a number of those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8174)|
| 2:16:20| and I think it would be wise to either use a subcommittee from that committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8180)|
| 2:16:25| and, if necessary, bring others into BEHR with those discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8185)|
| 2:16:30| So I would support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8190)|
| 2:16:32| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8192)|
| 2:16:33| Mr. Behr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8193)|
| 2:16:34| Before we vote, I actually did have a question as a follow-up for Mr. Peterson, if Mr. Peterson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8194)|
| 2:16:39| You were asked by the vice mayor, and partly I apologize that the e-mail, I'm just slower on that than usual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8199)|
| 2:16:46| but the vice mayor had asked you for the cost estimate on building the sidewalks for the five-point houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8206)|
| 2:16:53| What's the name of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8213)|
| 2:16:54| They're building some duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8214)|
| 2:16:57| Now, you had said it's $6,000 for all the units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8217)|
| 2:17:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8221)|
| 2:17:02| And how many units are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8222)|
| 2:17:03| There's four units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8223)|
| 2:17:04| Four units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8224)|
| 2:17:05| So it's $1,500 a unit to put in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8225)|
| 2:17:07| Do these units have garages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8227)|
| 2:17:09| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8229)|
| 2:17:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8230)|
| 2:17:11| Do they have driveways?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8231)|
| 2:17:12| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8232)|
| 2:17:13| Do you know how much the driveways are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8233)|
| 2:17:14| Not right off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8234)|
| 2:17:16| I mean, one of the interesting things is, again, sort of are we spending more money on places for the cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8236)|
| 2:17:22| or places for the people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8242)|
| 2:17:23| And if you can find that out, I'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8243)|
| 2:17:26| Yes, sir, I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8246)|
| 2:17:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8247)|
| 2:17:28| Mr. Peterson, just a follow-up question with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8248)|
| 2:17:31| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8251)|
| 2:17:32| Because it came up in a group I was meeting with the other evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8252)|
| 2:17:34| Are those driveways or are they pull-ins that are graveled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8254)|
| 2:17:38| Because I went out and sort of checked out the landscape, and I determined that they were graveled pull-offs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8258)|
| 2:17:47| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8267)|
| 2:17:48| Ours will be concrete driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8268)|
| 2:17:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8270)|
| 2:17:51| And the price that you gave was based on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8271)|
| 2:17:56| We took the driveways out of the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8276)|
| 2:17:58| Out of the equations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8278)|
| 2:17:59| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8279)|
| 2:18:01| Yeah, since we're asking about that, and I didn't get a chance to call you, Don.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8281)|
| 2:18:07| Over this next period of time, your figures that you came together, if you could bounce them with Steve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8287)|
| 2:18:13| I was surprised at the cost per square foot you quoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8293)|
| 2:18:17| And we've heard different costs from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8297)|
| 2:18:19| I know sometimes it costs more for government, but you all are government also to do business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8299)|
| 2:18:23| But I thought it was interesting, a little low, and I don't dispute your figures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8303)|
| 2:18:26| but it would be real interesting for you all to talk and match numbers there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8306)|
| 2:18:30| because we've heard or spent a lot more money per square foot from the city and building sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8310)|
| 2:18:35| than kind of what you guys quoted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8315)|
| 2:18:36| And I appreciate you responding so quickly, because I think you responded to me within a day or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8316)|
| 2:18:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8320)|
| 2:18:41| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| And you all can maybe put your heads together, Steve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| if you all can talk about, you know, those numbers and how that all comes out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8325)|
| 2:18:48| because that information is probably something that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8328)|
| 2:18:51| it wasn't real consistent with what Rick had said with regards to what he thought the cost was per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8331)|
| 2:18:56| Our numbers are based on the estimate that we got from a private contractor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8336)|
| 2:19:01| who's probably desperate for work right now, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8341)|
| 2:19:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8343)|
| 2:19:04| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8344)|
| 2:19:05| I appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8345)|
| 2:19:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8346)|
| 2:19:07| Right now the motion on the floor is to postpone for 12 weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8347)|
| 2:19:09| which will take us somewhere to early September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| I don't know the exact date, but Ms. Mitchell, I'm sure, can come up with that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8351)|
| 2:19:15| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8355)|
| 2:19:16| Did it include the fact that it was going to be referred to the transportation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8356)|
| 2:19:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8361)|
| 2:19:22| Well, I see Mr. Donaldson has an objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8362)|
| 2:19:23| He wanted to come to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8363)|
| 2:19:25| Is that what you were about to say, Mr. Donaldson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8365)|
| 2:19:30| Sidebar, I mentioned that we'd probably end up serving as staff to the Transportation and Mobility Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8370)|
| 2:19:36| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8376)|
| 2:19:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8377)|

| 2:20:12| So noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8412)|
| 2:20:13| Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8413)|
| 2:20:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8414)|
| 2:20:15| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8415)|
| 2:20:16| It's probably for Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8416)|
| 2:20:17| When it comes to these TIFs, are we actually giving the TIF to the group that's going to do the development or to the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8417)|
| 2:20:26| Oh, it's to the group to develop the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8426)|
| 2:20:29| So if they, and this is a question that came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8429)|
| 2:20:32| It really doesn't have anything to do with this particular one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8432)|
| 2:20:35| If we approve a TIF and the county commission approves a TIF whenever it goes to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8435)|
| 2:20:40| and then a week later they sell that property to Bob Becker, does he still have the TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8440)|
| 2:20:47| or does he have to start all the way back over and do it again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8447)|
| 2:20:51| Well, that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8451)|
| 2:20:53| That hasn't happened, but I believe we'd have to at least revisit it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8453)|
| 2:20:59| though if it's the exact same project, we'd have to, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8459)|
| 2:21:02| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8462)|
| 2:21:03| It is a contract basing a TIF to a specific individual for the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8463)|

| 2:23:55| How is that holding up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8635)|

| 2:24:10| We have reviewed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8650)|
| 2:24:12| We think that the product now is better and will adhere to the asphalt much longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8652)|
| 2:24:18| But it will have to be reapplied periodically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8658)|

| 2:24:32| I would estimate 50% more for concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8672)|
| 2:24:36| And that was the reason to go this route?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8676)|
| 2:24:39| No, not really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8679)|
| 2:24:40| We looked at it both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8680)|
| 2:24:43| It wasn't really a cost issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8683)|
| 2:24:46| We feel like any time you introduce a different pavement type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8686)|
| 2:24:52| like you introduce a strip of concrete transversely in an asphalt road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8692)|
| 2:24:57| you always get some failures as you transfer the wheel load from the asphalt to concrete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8697)|
| 2:25:04| because they react differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8704)|
| 2:25:07| In an ideal situation, you would keep asphalt and concrete separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8707)|
| 2:25:15| If you're going to have a concrete street, you'd have a concrete crosswalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8715)|
| 2:25:19| If you're going to have an asphalt street, you'd have an asphalt crosswalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8719)|
| 2:25:22| This product allows us to do some aesthetic treatment to the crosswalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8722)|
| 2:25:27| that we weren't able to do as well several years ago with asphalt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8727)|
| 2:25:33| So, there's not going to be a separation band of concrete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8733)|
| 2:25:36| between the regular pavement and the walkway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8736)|
| 2:25:39| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8739)|
| 2:25:40| Well, I hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8740)|
| 2:25:41| There will be a separation in color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8741)|
| 2:25:43| I hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8743)|
| 2:25:45| Of course, that doesn't apply when we do white topping at intersections, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8745)|
| 2:25:49| because we have a direct transition from concrete to asphalt there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8749)|
| 2:25:52| That doesn't seem to be an issue there, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8752)|
| 2:25:55| We have had some issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8755)|
| 2:25:57| We have had some failures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8757)|
| 2:25:59| I just was wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8759)|
| 2:26:00| I don't have a real problem with this necessarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8760)|
| 2:26:03| I just tend to maybe trust concrete in terms of pattern and colored material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8763)|
| 2:26:09| more than I would asphalt because I think there's some uncertainties there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8769)|
| 2:26:12| But, you know, I'm okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8772)|
| 2:26:14| But I'm a little curious as to how it's going to work out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8774)|
| 2:26:17| When we go, you know, we'll be coming to council sometime soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8777)|
| 2:26:21| with a contract to rebuild the 100-200 block of Gay Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8781)|
| 2:26:25| and that will be a concrete street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| And we will use concrete crosswalks that will have color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=8787)|

| 2:30:16| Mr. Hawkless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=9016)|
| 2:30:18| I just want to make sure that how we're redefining pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=9018)|
| 2:30:27| is just motorized and non-motorized wheelchairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=9027)|
| 2:30:31| So that's it, right, Chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=9031)|
| 2:30:34| Nothing else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=9034)|
| 2:30:36| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080617?start=9036)|
