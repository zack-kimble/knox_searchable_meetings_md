| 0:12:20| Maybe another 60, but no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=740)|

| 0:12:26| Is that what you're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=746)|

| 0:12:33| You're manufacturing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=753)|
| 0:12:34| Okay, the next one that you're applying for is the manufacturing permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| And, um, Sergeant, I mean, Officer Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| Same thing, no record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Again, copy of the sales tax registration, building inspection, fire prevention, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=765)|
| 0:12:50| Okay, um, do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| Motion to approve, pen and final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=772)|

| 0:13:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=808)|
| 0:13:29| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=809)|

| 0:13:31| All right, well, then we will see you on November 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=812)|
| 0:13:33| Are you still in the construction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=813)|
| 0:13:34| Wait, wait, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| Before you, what is the bourbon, what is the bourbon, I can't even say it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| Bourbon Bird.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=819)|

| 0:13:43| It's going to be a restaurant, you know, where the old Hurricane Grill and Wings used to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| We're just changing the concept in there, putting in a new concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=828)|
| 0:13:52| It's bourbon and chicken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| Bourbon and chicken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=834)|

| 0:13:59| Diana Coffey at the Regas Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=839)|
| 0:14:08| I'm John Clark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| The address is 318 North K Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| Officer Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| We need the approvals from building inspection and fire prevention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| And do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| Move to approve pen and file documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=867)|
| 0:14:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| We now have some previously considered applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| The Nine Pines Ale House on Rutledge Pike in District 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| You had a 60-day extension granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| First of all, you applied on March 28th, 60-day extension June 20th, and then another 60-day extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=883)|
| 0:14:50| So here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| Well, it's Nate Gross, 4912 Rutledge Pike, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| It's been an interest in the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| Apparently there was a miscommunication between us and the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=901)|
| 0:15:05| and they had our building under the wrong category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| So what that means is all of our original plans were rejected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| We had to resubmit our site plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| So our engineer and the city suggested it could be another six weeks just before the parking lot gets approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=916)|
| 0:15:25| So based on that and the upcoming holidays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=925)|
| 0:15:29| and the likelihood that that may also slow some more things down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=929)|
| 0:15:33| we'd like to ask for a 90-day extension, if at all possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=933)|
| 0:15:37| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=937)|
| 0:15:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=938)|
| 0:15:39| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=940)|
| 0:15:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| Thank you, and good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| Before he leaves, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=944)|
| 0:15:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=945)|
| 0:15:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=946)|
| 0:15:47| They classified the building wrong?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=948)|
| 0:15:50| As an assembly, and apparently an assembly in a restaurant is the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=950)|
| 0:15:55| So that's usually an occupancy of over 50, and so we're wanting our occupancy 49 and under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=955)|
| 0:16:03| How does that affect your parking lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| I don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| Well, the handicap, the bathrooms, because you're higher occupancy, it also increases your code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=967)|
| 0:16:15| All those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| So you're getting just under that by going 49?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Also, the handicap accessibility, if you have more than one, it puts you in that assembly category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=982)|
| 0:16:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=988)|
| 0:16:29| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| The 17th Street Market and Deli, did they withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| I've actually not spoken with that applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| This was a prior applicant to the one who was earlier before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1002)|
| 0:16:48| They didn't respond to certified letter, email, and several phone calls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1008)|
| 0:16:54| The current owner reports that this was a prior attempt at purchasing the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| and that they abandoned the purchase prior to closing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| So is there an existing permit now for the old business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| Yeah, there's a current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1029)|
| 0:17:10| They're running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| The 17th Street Market and Deli is currently operating,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1031)|
| 0:17:14| and then earlier there's an applicant who is purchasing that business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| This applicant that's on the addendum was an earlier interested party who never followed through after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1040)|
| 0:17:28| So should this application be basically scrapped?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1048)|
| 0:17:31| I mean, it's no longer effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1051)|
| 0:17:33| They're not buying the building, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1053)|
| 0:17:35| You can't have more than one permit per location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| My advice would be just to let this thing die with no motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| Just let it lapse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1062)|
| 0:17:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1064)|
| 0:17:45| Thank you, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1065)|
| 0:17:46| So sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| Central Depot, 103 West Depot Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1069)|
| 0:17:57| Daniel Carter, 103 West Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| We also had the same issue with occupancy and had it resolved midsummer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| expecting this to be a 90-day project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1085)|
| 0:18:07| It's turned into an eight- to nine-month project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| We're working now with a woodworking artist that we're sharing with the Oakmont Exchange around the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1090)|
| 0:18:15| He's trying to get us both completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1095)|
| 0:18:17| I would ask for safety's sake another 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1103)|
| 0:18:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| 50 to 49 or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1106)|
| 0:18:27| Same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1107)|
| 0:18:28| Same issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| The landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| That's your break point is 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| The break point is 50, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| And we needed it to be under 50, and they finally agreed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| arrived at a calculation that they could agree on, landlord and city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| and so that finally moved on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1120)|
| 0:18:42| But it took about three to four months for that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1122)|
| 0:18:44| It slows your plan review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| The plans get rejected when there's not a sufficient calculation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| And so finally one was agreed and provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| I've learned a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Painfully, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| Maybe the next one will be a two-month next business venture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1137)|
| 0:19:01| I've done a bar before twice, actually, that had been a bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| and it took me 90 days both times, so I had no idea how this could unfold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| It's been an interesting year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| I appreciate your patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1151)|
| 0:19:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1153)|
| 0:19:14| Next is the Tennessee Tap House, and they picked their permit up, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1157)|
| 0:19:18| Oh, very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1158)|
| 0:19:19| They don't lie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| Yay for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| All right, we have an administrative hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| and this is the DW Restaurant is the holder doing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| as Hooters of Knoxville on Merchant Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| On April 26th, they were cited for a sale to a minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| and it was the first time in a two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| On May 3rd, they submitted a remedial plan, which is attached.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1179)|
| 0:19:44| On September 29th, they were cited a second time for a sale to a minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| and this was the second time in the two-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| On October 4th, they got the notice of administrative hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| On October 5th, they received that notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1197)|
| 0:20:02| and on October 17th, the remedial plan and $500 fine was submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1202)|
| 0:20:09| Do you have anything that you'd like to say in two minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| I'm starting to call you Your Honor, I guess I should say, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1214)|
| 0:20:17| I'm Tasha Blakeney of Eldridge and Blakeney here in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| 400 West Church Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1220)|
| 0:20:22| It's my pleasure to represent Hooters in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1222)|
| 0:20:25| I'm also attending our Gary Stepp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| He is the regional manager for Hooters in our area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| and also Will Barnes, who's the general manager of the particular location at issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| As you noted, Madam Chair, there was a list of remedial measures that was submitted timely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| also the $500 fine, which is required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1241)|
| 0:20:44| I won't go over point by point the things that have occurred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| because I know that the members of the Commission have seen that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| but it is important to note that they had 45 people attend just on Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| a retraining session for all of their servers and staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| They have now ordered ID scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| The offending servers who were involved in those two issues were terminated from their employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1261)|
| 0:21:08| and the restaurant takes very seriously these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1268)|
| 0:21:10| and hopes that you will never see their or my smiling face here again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1270)|
| 0:21:15| other than perhaps for happier matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1275)|
| 0:21:18| And they ask that in light of their compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| that this matter be referred for no further action at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Counsel Mandela-Vopay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| Just curious, what happened after the first citation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| Did you have a remedial plan in place at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1290)|
| 0:21:33| There was a remedial plan in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1293)|
| 0:21:35| and unfortunately what happened with this second offense is that the server did check the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1295)|
| 0:21:40| but just simply miscalculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1300)|
| 0:21:43| It appeared that the date of birth to her was that it ended in a 6, but it was actually an 8,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1303)|
| 0:21:49| and she literally just misread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1309)|
| 0:21:51| Because it wasn't clear on the license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| It either wasn't clear or it was too dark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1313)|
| 0:21:55| and she just misread it and thought that it was covered, and she just miscalculated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| But now you're going to have them scanned, and some electronic device is going to say yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1319)|
| 0:22:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| The ID scanners have already been purchased, and they're supposed to be installed imminently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| And you'll train your people on that, I take it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1334)|
| 0:22:15| It was just truly human error.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1335)|
| 0:22:16| The driver's license for someone under 21 has a red bar around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| and that seems to me to be pretty hard to miss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| Under 21?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1345)|
| 0:22:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1346)|
| 0:22:27| It's red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1347)|
| 0:22:28| And then also very soon in 2018, while we're getting there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| the driver's license for underage will change direction so that you can look at it instantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1352)|
| 0:22:37| and see that it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd171024?start=1357)|
