| 0:01:58| Consent items are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| For the Mayor's report, first I want to remind everyone that early voting has started in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=119)|
| 0:02:04| the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| It continues through next Thursday, September 24th, and then the actual primary is two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=126)|
| 0:02:13| from today on Tuesday, September 29th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| So as of the end of the day Monday, apparently only 584 people had voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=137)|
| 0:02:23| That's an average of about 117 people per day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=143)|
| 0:02:26| We have nearly 75,000 registered voters, so that's less than 1% of them who have voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Now everybody in this room and anybody watching from TV, you're engaged, you're informed citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=153)|
| 0:02:40| you understand what we do here and why it's important that we get out and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| There are a lot of folks, maybe your friends, neighbors, family members that aren't paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=165)|
| 0:02:49| attention to this right now, and I hope that you will reach out to them and encourage them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=169)|
| 0:02:54| to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=174)|
| 0:02:55| Maybe you can post it on Facebook, tweet it, ask your pastor to talk about it in church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| Just know that we know that we get better government when people are informed and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=180)|
| 0:03:05| are active and vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=185)|
| 0:03:07| So you can find all the information that you need about early voting locations and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=187)|
| 0:03:12| a sample ballot on the Election Commission website, which is KnoxCounty.org slash election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=192)|
| 0:03:19| Encourage you all to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=199)|
| 0:03:22| Let's see, also a reminder that because the election is two weeks from today, we normally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| have our council meeting on the 29th, but we voted a while back to change that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=208)|
| 0:03:33| to the next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=213)|
| 0:03:34| So we will meet on Wednesday, September 30th at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| That will be the next commission, next council meeting, that's a flashback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=219)|
| 0:03:45| Next city council meeting, September 30th at 7 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=225)|
| 0:03:51| One other announcement I wanted to make is tomorrow at 11 a.m. we will be at Fire Station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=231)|
| 0:03:57| Number 4 on Linden Avenue to do the formal christening or traditional christening of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=237)|
| 0:04:04| a new fire truck, and it's the Quint truck, which was manufactured in Minnesota, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=244)|
| 0:04:12| it's a unique aerial unit and a fire pumping unit all rolled into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| Maybe you want to say something about it, Chief Morris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=257)|
| 0:04:21| Obviously we're very excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=261)|
| 0:04:23| It's the second unit of this type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=263)|
| 0:04:25| It's manufactured by a company called Rosenbauer out of Wyoming, Minnesota.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=265)|
| 0:04:29| It's a Quint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| We have one serving in the Lonsdale community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| It's been there for a little over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| The crews love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| It's a great truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=276)|
| 0:04:37| It functions very well, and this truck is in the Five Points area serving on Linden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| at Olive, and they're very excited in that community to get that truck as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=283)|
| 0:04:46| So we're very, like I said, the crews love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=286)|
| 0:04:50| It's a great truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=292)|
| 0:04:53| And so we'll do the formal or the traditional christening tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=293)|
| 0:04:55| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=295)|
| 0:04:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| Years ago when I was much younger in the department, we did a service at Fountain City, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=298)|
| 0:05:04| mayor handed over a set of keys, and that used to be the way that we do it, but there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=304)|
| 0:05:08| a more formal way where you actually wet it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| You throw water on the truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=311)|
| 0:05:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=314)|
| 0:05:15| So that'll be fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| So come on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| That is tomorrow at 11 a.m. at Fire Station Number 4, which is 2300 Linden Avenue at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=317)|
| 0:05:24| corner of Olive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=324)|

| 0:18:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1139)|
| 0:19:00| I just got to ask Chief Brown, what is seatbelt use research?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| Is that where you stop a car and say, clip it on or I'll give you a ticket?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| No, it's actually a passive observation to see if people are wearing their belts at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1150)|
| 0:19:17| Is there some reason why nighttime is selected as visiting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| The highest number of fatalities happen during the evening and night hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| People are tired, they're drinking, all kinds of things are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| And what we've noticed the most recent is that at nighttime, seatbelt use is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1167)|
| 0:19:37| And so this will help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Don't they have like a checkpoint or something where they stop and you look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| No, it won't be a checkpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1181)|
| 0:19:42| This will be passive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| This will be our officers assisting researchers to make sure that it's, to see what's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1184)|
| 0:19:49| on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| And then they'll use that research on the state level to target information to get people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1190)|
| 0:19:56| to wear their seatbelts at night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1196)|

| 0:20:04| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1204)|

| 0:20:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1250)|
| 0:20:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| Is David up here because he knew you were going to ask him a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| David and I had a discussion earlier, but I'd like for him to just briefly explain the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1256)|
| 0:21:03| situation and also PBA's involvement in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1263)|
| 0:21:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1266)|
| 0:21:08| PBA is actually David Bray's city public works, which includes public service, new title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1268)|
| 0:21:15| And thank you, Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Yes, the Beardsley Farm project, many of you were at the groundbreaking, an ongoing project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1282)|
| 0:21:24| We did an initial design two years ago, and it was a very basic building, and at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1284)|
| 0:21:31| we were slightly over budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| Elizabeth Easton Architecture recommended we partner with UT, which has been wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| We partnered with UT Design and Architecture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1298)|
| 0:21:40| It's been a great partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| It has added length to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| The economy has recovered, or is recovering, so we're seeing higher bid prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1304)|
| 0:21:51| The creative design that came out of UT also added some additional costs to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| Actually have Ms. Chove, Khan Chove, if you'll raise your hand, she is the farm manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| And so Beardsley has been at this location on city property for over 15 years, so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1320)|
| 0:22:06| feel like we're getting a better building, a well-designed building, but there are additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| costs, and that is the request today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1330)|
| 0:22:13| And PBA's involvement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1333)|
| 0:22:14| Yeah, PBA, actually PBA has had some staff changes, as you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1334)|
| 0:22:18| And so we have Glenn Richters, who is filling in on contract for PBA, and he's managing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1338)|
| 0:22:23| this project and doing a fabulous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| Susan Davis is also an employee of PBA and is involved in the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| So the management is going well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| I would say that PBA is really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| There's some things that UT would like to do that we've had to scale back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| They're very creative ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1357)|
| 0:22:38| So we are getting a very creative and lead-oriented building, but it is going to cost a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1364)|
| 0:22:45| And we expanded the programming as we work with Khan and her staff, the AmeriCorps staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| We needed an outdoor classroom and more space for, really, their outdoor activities with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| children and other low-income individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| So it's a better building, but there are costs with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1377)|
| 0:23:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| Councilman Delgado.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| Yeah, for Councilman Grieve's benefit, so if you consult an architect, you end up spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| more money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| Well, I mean, I think there's really two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| One is we've actually...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1392)|
| 0:23:13| It's being facetious, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1393)|
| 0:23:14| Not unlike consulting an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| Yeah, they're embarrassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| I was going to say, don't answer that, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| They've got a slightly lower billable rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| But it is, I mean, the building has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| We initially designed what I would call is a very basic box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| And it wasn't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| I mean, it was a fine building, and we were slightly over budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| And so we have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| Mr. York was actually looking ahead on this a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1413)|
| 0:23:35| So he had some money in an account in Parks and Rec.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1415)|
| 0:23:39| And so we were able to pull on that account, and with his help and with Christy's help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| and the mayor's help, this is an important building, and we're going to get a great building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| and hope to have it ready, obviously, for Khan and her staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1428)|
| 0:23:51| Is it like an amphitheater-type thing, or is it still...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| Well, it includes a small amphitheater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| What we had was essentially initially just a building with two restrooms and an office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1435)|
| 0:23:59| A box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1439)|
| 0:24:00| Yeah, it was a box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| And as we looked at their programming needs, they had a real need to educate kids in an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1441)|
| 0:24:05| outdoor environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| So it's a covered environment where they can do education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| We're also utilizing, and this is what UT helped with, they've gotten multiple partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1449)|
| 0:24:14| So General Brick and Shale donated bricks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1454)|
| 0:24:18| And we're actually creating a structural brick wall that, I guess, has massing to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| so it's good from a lead perspective, from an energy efficiency perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| And we've gotten a rainwater collection system, and we're actually doing a terrace down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1468)|
| 0:24:33| hill so we can connect to the Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1473)|
| 0:24:36| So it's a smarter plan all around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| It's a better building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1478)|
| 0:24:39| You know, with any partnership, it adds length to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| UT is a big organization, like us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| And so there's been some time delays, but it's worth the effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| We've been, you know, that farm has been there for 15 years, and they've worked out of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| barn and a porta potty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| And so, and we haven't had great accessibility there for folks who need that type of access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| And so we're going to correct that, and it's important to get it right, because we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| to build this building for the next 50 to 75 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| Mr. Dellavopi, it's a better building because they have an architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| Just want you to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| Right, David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| Right, David?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| You know, the advantage to UT is we've gotten a lot of creative thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| I'm the guy that has to say we can't afford that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| So we're trying to scale things back, but there are added costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| And the economy's turned around, so as we've gone out to bid certain trades, they've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| a little higher as the economy's gotten better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| Thank you much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1533)|
| 0:25:34| Thank you, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1535)|
| 0:25:36| Thank you, David.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1538)|
| 0:25:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1539)|
| 0:25:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1541)|
| 0:25:42| 12A is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code, Chapter 2, Article 9, Section 2-1076,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1542)|
| 0:25:49| regarding a special assessment levy in the Central Business Improvement District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1549)|
| 0:25:53| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| Whoops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| Where'd it go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Councilman Dellavopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Yeah, I understand that this is going to be something that the CBID board looks at on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1558)|
| 0:26:05| a case-by-case basis, and then will refer to us, but I was concerned since it seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1565)|
| 0:26:12| to tie the lack of a levy or an increased levy on improved value for the length of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1572)|
| 0:26:21| TIF or pilot, and maybe that's not such a big deal when they're 5 or 10 years, but if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| it's a 25-year pilot or TIF, I kind of wonder why a new commercial institution isn't helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1586)|
| 0:26:34| the Central Business District to kind of, you know, do better and survive, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| maybe it's too open-ended, too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| If you could address that, Mr. Emmett, that'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1603)|
| 0:26:46| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1606)|
| 0:26:47| Rick Emmett, downtown coordinator, 400 Main Street here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| Yes, this went to the CBID board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| Mr. Dover went to the development committee first and made his proposal for this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1613)|
| 0:27:00| grant, and then also went to the full board and made his proposal there, and it was adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| to full board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| It's not that unusual for us to have large development grants come to the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| We've given out grants through the CBID, and I'm on the CBID board as the mayor's representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| We've given $300,000 grants to several groups, the Arnstein Building, the Penneys Building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1635)|
| 0:27:20| and others, and it's really not that different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| The only difference is that when we do that, those grants are usually granted over a five-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| period at $100,000 or, you know, some large amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| This way, it's kind of spread out over the 20-some years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| The first time we've really done went through CBID, which I really think is a better way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1660)|
| 0:27:41| The CBID budget doesn't take that hit of, you know, a $50,000 every year for a few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1661)|
| 0:27:47| as it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| Was there any discussion about whether a new business entity should be contributing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| that fund that helps build the downtown, though, and sustain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1675)|
| 0:27:58| I'm not sure what you mean by a new business entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1678)|
| 0:28:02| I mean, it's not like a new business like the Farragut Hotel that's got a 25-year TIFR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Yeah, I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| That's always an issue, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1688)|
| 0:28:09| Whenever we give any of these grants, I mean, if we give a $300,000 grant, that's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1689)|
| 0:28:13| that's not going to be paid for a number of years by any new business that comes into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| So, yeah, that's certainly consideration, but we get, you know, we get the base amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1697)|
| 0:28:22| as we've always gotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| Do you agree that it should be during the term of the TIFR, the pilot, or should that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1704)|
| 0:28:27| be something discretionary that the board discusses at the time it looks at a case-by-case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1707)|
| 0:28:32| analysis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| That's what I'm wondering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| Is this grant too broad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| It'll probably be a case-by-case as we go, but really, if it goes with the TIFR, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1716)|
| 0:28:39| pilot, that's a simple way to do it, because if you realize how these things happen, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1719)|
| 0:28:43| goes to the IDB board for administration, and so as they're administering the regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1723)|
| 0:28:48| tax money, they can get the assessment as well, and if they have to have some different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| term or something in there, it may make that more complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| But again, we look at the but for to begin with, and it depends on what, you know, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| financing is, and if the financing package will work on a shorter term, we always look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1741)|
| 0:29:05| at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Do you take this authority, then, as up to the length of the TIFR pilot or the full length| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| of the TIFR pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1751)|
| 0:29:13| I think we're looking at it to the, up to the limit of the full pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| Again, this is going to be very, very rarely used as our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1757)|
| 0:29:24| Even on this one, we were somewhat concerned when they suggested this, but again, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1764)|
| 0:29:31| seen the finance stack for many properties, like the Panties Building, where they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1771)|
| 0:29:35| the $300,000 CBID assessment as part of their financing stack, so it's not really that unusual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1775)|
| 0:29:41| for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Well, the reason I ask that is that the language that we're being asked to adopt says, if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1782)|
| 0:29:45| assessment abatement, excuse me, if the assessment abatement is approved by city council, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1785)|
| 0:29:50| assessment abatement shall continue for the term of the pilot or TIFR agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| I mean, maybe that should be, may continue up to the term of, I mean, do you think it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| should be just a flat-out grant for the full term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| Well, it's certainly much easier that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1804)|
| 0:30:06| I didn't draft that language, but I don't know if somebody else wants to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1806)|
| 0:30:13| I could address that somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| This is, we are committed to the CBID to take these to the CBID board for their approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1816)|
| 0:30:22| We're not going to, you know, just impose this, so, and as Rick said, when we discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1822)|
| 0:30:28| this language this way, that was acceptable to the CBID board to be used instead for major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1828)|
| 0:30:34| projects only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1834)|
| 0:30:35| We're not, we don't anticipate taking many to them, but they saw, just to add some to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| the discussion, I was at both the board meetings to which Rick referred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| The Farragut Hotel to the CBID is a tremendous benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1845)|
| 0:30:50| They see that as having all of these folks in town with spending the money and the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1850)|
| 0:30:55| on retail and everything else is a tremendous benefit in and of itself, aside from the fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| In fact, the fee is secondary to the impact of that many people here every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| That was the thinking of the board, I think I could say, safely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| So in your view, shall is better than may continue for the full term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1867)|
| 0:31:11| Well, I don't know that it's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| I think it keeps it simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| Well it's sort of an all or nothing at the CBID level, but I'm going to have to defer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| to the attorneys as to what works legally in those, and I think, you know, this language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| was put in, I believe, for a reason to be consistent with state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1886)|
| 0:31:31| I'm just not sure what that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| We could, I think once you start having partial TIFs and Pilots one place and the other it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1894)|
| 0:31:39| does complicate it somewhat, and if the CBID board with the entirety of it doesn't feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| comfortable with it, we're not, we don't have any intention of forcing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| That's the use of their funds as they see fit, and as Rick said, this is part of a larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1908)|
| 0:31:52| discussion that says it's better for them to participate as we do without ever writing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1912)|
| 0:31:57| a check but deferring some income than to do what they have done in the past for major| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| projects, and by the way, the Arnstein Mass General Store too, I don't think either one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1922)|
| 0:32:06| of those could have possibly occurred without that CBID chunk of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1926)|
| 0:32:10| This is just a better way to do it that makes it more responsible budgeting on their part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| That was our thinking, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=1935)|

| 0:34:41| Councilman Delevope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| Yeah, I don't know if we have a rep from UT here, but maybe they can address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2083)|
| 0:34:50| We have done this before, and I know you all have a master plan where you try and improve the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| and the walkability for protecting students and pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| You've got about six of these things or so, and the last one is Volunteer Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| which is a pretty major thoroughfare for residents of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2106)|
| 0:35:11| and it says you won't necessarily close it to traffic, but it doesn't say you won't either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2116)|
| 0:35:17| Just tell us about the program briefly and address the Volunteer Boulevard portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2117)|
| 0:35:21| because that's really the most controversial one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| First, Jeff Maples with the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| The one you're referencing here now, 12, I believe it's 12, G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2129)|
| 0:35:36| that's an alley at White Avenue that's been closed for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| This is just a cleanup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2139)|
| 0:35:40| It's a no-brainer, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2140)|
| 0:35:42| But the rest of these are part of what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2142)|
| 0:35:44| This is the third phase of roads we've brought to Council in the past two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| and I think there was some concern on behalf of Council a few years ago that we would be closing roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2148)|
| 0:35:55| I think we've addressed that concern because we've not done that, and we have no intention to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2155)|
| 0:36:00| Mainly this is part of a master plan we're looking at to beautify the campus, do streetscape projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2160)|
| 0:36:07| and I think a lot of what we're doing to address your concerns about Volunteer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| it does run through the middle of campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2171)|
| 0:36:13| There is no way we could ever close that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| It's just not possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| There was complaints about bogging traffic Saturday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| You close Volunteer Boulevard, you're going to really create a traffic jam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2179)|
| 0:36:24| So, again, what we want to do on Volunteer, because it is a major thoroughfare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| is the university put money into it to change out the median that runs through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| to change out the sidewalks, brick pavers, lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| everything much similar to what we're doing on Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| I think we'll really connect Volunteer and Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| And I understand that you have a master plan that you're working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| that will make it a better integrated road system for the university's purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| We commend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| That's absolutely correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| And the paperwork we get says you cut out another layer of approvals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| every time you want to take a step by not having to come to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2219)|
| 0:37:02| That makes a lot of sense, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2222)|
| 0:37:04| I was just concerned, I guess, about Volunteer Boulevard in terms of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| No, there's no way we could ever close that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| There's no intention to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| So, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2234)|
| 0:37:15| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2235)|
| 0:37:17| Councilman Stare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| I guess I want to start by just expressing my,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| and I think it's shared by many citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| my extreme disappointment at the demolition of the historic buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2244)|
| 0:37:28| on White Avenue by the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| I'm not saying this to bash the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| I just see the historic Fort Sanders neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| just could be a tremendous asset to the university if it just embraced it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2259)|
| 0:37:45| And this council put in this neighborhood conservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| sometime obviously before I was on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| So when I walked to the game this Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| it was sad to see those houses gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| One has been moved, but the other two I believe were demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| And so my concern doesn't lie with the Volunteer Boulevard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2281)|
| 0:38:05| but with the alley closings on White| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| because I feel like we're creating a precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| that would cause further and further encroachment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| upon the neighborhood conservation area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2293)|
| 0:38:17| So I guess I'd ask Mr. Mabels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| could you commit that the university would not buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| and demolish other properties in the neighborhood conservation district?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2303)|
| 0:38:29| I can tell you right now the university has no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2309)|
| 0:38:31| in the current administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| has no further desire to go further north than White Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| The three houses you referenced, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| and again I understand your concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| and we shared some of those same sentiments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| regarding the historical district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| Those three houses have been within the historical institutional zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| of the university for over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2327)|
| 0:38:49| So that was why we moved forward with that request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2329)|
| 0:38:54| because of the building there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| But again, moving forward, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2336)|
| 0:38:59| there is nothing within our master plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2339)|
| 0:39:01| that addresses us going further into the Fort Sanders area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2341)|
| 0:39:05| Matter of fact, we get inquiries quite often from property owners in the Fort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2345)|
| 0:39:11| asking if the university desires to buy property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2351)|
| 0:39:14| and the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2354)|
| 0:39:16| So we prove that almost every single week with inquiries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| I guess that's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2364)|
| 0:39:25| And these are alleys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| and I guess I'll support them with that statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| but I would just encourage the university to really reach out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| and do things to encourage faculty and staff to live in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| and try to really make it the asset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| I think we all believe it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| Jeff, we know what has transpired thus far with the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| and the streetscapes that you've done over at UT,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| and you're to be commended for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| and in fact the whole entrance to the campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| The question I have is have you already designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2399)|
| 0:40:02| what is going to go on Volunteer Boulevard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2402)|
| 0:40:04| Of the streets that you're asking to be closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2404)|
| 0:40:06| this is the one that several people have talked about in terms of a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| in terms of what is going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| Do you have designs of that that you can share with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| Not at this time, because we have to get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2414)|
| 0:40:17| We've done some preliminary work on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| but we do not have a definite design at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| We'll be glad at some point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| when we have those plans to share those with council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| I personally would like to see what you have in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2429)|
| 0:40:32| I do know, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| that what we've done so far is a vast improvement over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| but we would like to see what you all do have planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2440)|
| 0:40:41| Thank you, Mr. Maples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2441)|

| 0:44:31| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2671)|

| 0:44:34| 12O is an ordinance to rezone property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| on the east side of North Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2675)|
| 0:44:37| northeast side of North Central Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2677)|

| 0:44:46| applicant 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| Moved to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2689)|
| 0:44:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| Councilman Delavante.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| I don't see Gerald Green here, but I see his handy trusty Dan Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2696)|
| 0:45:02| Dan, the question has been raised to me about this particular one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2702)|
| 0:45:09| in terms of going from C3 to C2 Central Business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| Among other things, that relieves you of the parking obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2714)|
| 0:45:19| as most downtown properties have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| That general area in the past has had attempts by folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2723)|
| 0:45:28| to sort of change a mushroom factory into a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2728)|
| 0:45:33| and make it a homeless shelter or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2733)|
| 0:45:36| They were concerned about this kind of rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| as you get further north into sort of the neighborhood areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| Can you just tell us why we're doing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| and what's planned to go there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2748)|
| 0:45:53| There has been some planning work done with regard to Central Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| and some of the other areas in the close-in area to CBD,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2757)|
| 0:46:01| or you want to call it CBD North.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| Right, and that's the heart of that downtown north stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2763)|
| 0:46:06| This is an extension of that, and the idea, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2766)|
| 0:46:12| the C2 zone is probably not the best zoning district available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2772)|
| 0:46:16| or it's the best zoning district available to do the redevelopment under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| It's something that we are looking at, and we've had discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2781)|
| 0:46:27| The mixed-use stuff that we're doing down in the Bearden area now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2787)|
| 0:46:32| Bearden is probably just step one when we're talking about mixed-use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2792)|
| 0:46:36| We'll probably be looking at other areas in the community at some point later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2796)|
| 0:46:42| So from that standpoint, C2 is the best tool that we have right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| to encourage mixed-use and redevelopment in some of the older parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| Are you looking at any kind of a corridor overlay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2809)|
| 0:46:51| or anything that might have standards and criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| that give it a level of comfort as to what's going on in terms of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| There is work being done right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2818)|
| 0:47:00| Right now, again, the Bearden district is going to be the first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| and we'll probably be rolling that out in about a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| All right, and then this would follow after that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| Well, we're going to look at all potential areas that this type of activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2830)|
| 0:47:16| or zoning could be applied to, but at the present time right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2836)|
| 0:47:20| we're focusing on Bearden, and then we're going to look at these areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| Now, these go to a use on review before they're permitted, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| Not necessarily, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2848)|
| 0:47:30| Well, there was some reference here to if a new building is proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| in either the location of the existing building or the surface parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| use on review approval by MPC shall be required before the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| That was the condition of the rezoning, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| On this particular portion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2864)|
| 0:47:45| On that particular portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2865)|
| 0:47:47| Not on the general C2 district, but on that particular rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| Do you know if the draft heart of Knoxville zone would affect this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| or is that purely residential?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| We haven't pursued the heart of Knoxville zoning district in some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| So the more likely item will be the corridor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| I think what you will see will be a new product, a new zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| a new set of zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2891)|
| 0:48:13| All right, well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2893)|
| 0:48:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| KOP is an ordinance to rezone the northwest side of Francis Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| southwest of Ciccone Lane from A1 to R1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| William and Brenda Bidwell Applicant, 3rd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2915)|
| 0:48:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2920)|
| 0:48:41| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2921)|
| 0:48:42| Council, that is the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2922)|
| 0:48:44| No one has signed up for public forum, so we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2924)|
| 0:48:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150915?start=2933)|
