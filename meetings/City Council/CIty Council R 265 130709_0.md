| 0:01:30| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| The ayes have it and the minutes are approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=94)|
| 0:01:37| Are there any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| Any items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=100)|
| 0:01:41| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=101)|
| 0:01:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=102)|
| 0:01:43| Yes, I have several.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| First, I'd like to postpone item 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=105)|
| 0:01:50| The green code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=110)|
| 0:01:51| Green code, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| Green construction code?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| We need some additional time to work with the legal staff to put the final ordinance together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=113)|
| 0:01:59| So we'd like to have a postponement of 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| 90 days, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=121)|
| 0:02:03| And I don't know if you want to comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| Sure, I can add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=125)|
| 0:02:08| So we did the presentation at the last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| I believe it was the last council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=131)|
| 0:02:13| And at that time we decided that adoption of the green code for voluntary use only might be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=133)|
| 0:02:19| We would delay the adoption until January 1, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| We're going to be working with the legal department to get that ordinance put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| and we'll present it to you within the next 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| Okay, and so that's a motion, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=151)|
| 0:02:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| We have a motion and a second to postpone 12A for 90 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=155)|
| 0:02:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=159)|
| 0:02:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=160)|
| 0:02:41| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=161)|
| 0:02:42| We postpone that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| Do you have more, Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=163)|
| 0:02:45| Yes, Mayor, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| We would like to postpone for 30 days 12B, C, and D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| This is a request by Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=171)|
| 0:02:55| He has been working on an additional plan that he would like to have a bit more time to see how it might tie into his development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=175)|
| 0:03:03| And so he has requested that we postpone for 30 days 12B, C, and D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=183)|
| 0:03:09| Would you like to make that 28 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=189)|
| 0:03:11| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=192)|
| 0:03:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=193)|
| 0:03:14| To fit in with our council schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=195)|
| 0:03:16| We would like to postpone for 28 days that is 12B, C, and D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=201)|
| 0:03:22| B, C, and D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=202)|
| 0:03:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| We had a motion and we had a second, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| So a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=207)|

| 0:03:30| Okay, those are postponed for 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=210)|
| 0:03:36| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=217)|
| 0:03:38| Continuing down the alphabet, I'd like to recommend that we postpone 12E and F for 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=218)|
| 0:03:46| That's the Middlebrook Pike at Francis Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=226)|
| 0:03:48| For how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| 28 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=230)|
| 0:03:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| I heard a second there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=232)|
| 0:03:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=233)|
| 0:03:54| So 12E and F, we have a motion and a second to postpone that for 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=234)|
| 0:04:00| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=240)|
| 0:04:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=241)|
| 0:04:02| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=242)|
| 0:04:03| The ayes have it and those are postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| Is there more, Councilwoman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=248)|
| 0:04:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=250)|
| 0:04:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| Shorten the agenda a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| Anything to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=259)|
| 0:04:23| Is there a motion on the consent item, which is one renewal certificate of compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=263)|
| 0:04:27| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=268)|
| 0:04:29| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=271)|
| 0:04:32| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=272)|
| 0:04:33| The ayes have it and that is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| For the Mayor's Report, first off, I want to thank our Special Events Office, particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| our Special Events Director, Julia Foltz, but also Kendra and Elaine and all of our public service workers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=280)|
| 0:04:46| our police officers, our firefighters, all the folks who worked over the holiday while most of us were on break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=286)|
| 0:04:55| They worked to pull off our Fourth of July celebration for the city, and they did a fabulous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=295)|
| 0:05:02| You know, we had to make some difficult decisions on whether to postpone it, like some communities did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=302)|
| 0:05:10| or to move ahead, and we decided to move ahead and it worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| The WDBX music was great during the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| We had to postpone our repellers from the fire department because we didn't want to risk their lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=316)|
| 0:05:25| I don't know if you two want to talk any more smack about the firefighters and the police department tug of war.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=325)|
| 0:05:33| I think our actions spoke loudly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| This was just a practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=337)|
| 0:05:39| We'll look forward to more competition next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| So that was a big event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=342)|
| 0:05:44| And the symphony, they had a full program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| It was a beautiful, beautiful program from the symphony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| Even though it was raining off and on throughout the event, a lot of people were there under umbrellas and had a wonderful show.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=351)|
| 0:05:58| We have a great symphony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=358)|
| 0:05:59| And then, of course, the fireworks were fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| So it was a great day, and we didn't let the weather disturb us at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=361)|
| 0:06:06| We went on with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| So thank you to all of our city employees, but particularly to our special events office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=367)|
| 0:06:13| And also I want to make sure you all know that the second meeting of the World's Fair Park Working Group will be held at 5.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=373)|
| 0:06:22| on Monday, July 15th at Windows on the Park at Holiday Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| You all know the working group was formed to begin discussions on possible future cultural amenities on the grounds of the World's Fair Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=388)|
| 0:06:36| The group consists largely of World's Fair Park institutional stakeholders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| However, all of those meetings are open to the public, and we encourage you to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| So, again, the next meeting will be Monday, July 15th at 5.30 p.m. at the Windows on the Park at Holiday Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=406)|
| 0:06:56| Also, about an hour ago, we had a press conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| All of council was there with me on Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| And we announced that after many, many years, and I think this is the fourth administration perhaps working on this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=426)|
| 0:07:14| we announced that the city has reached an agreement with the bankruptcy trustee of the McClung Warehouses on Jackson Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=434)|
| 0:07:22| and we are settling a four-year-old lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| We will be bringing the proposal, which is to purchase that property and to settle all claims on the lawsuit for $1.45 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=445)|
| 0:07:36| We'll be bringing that proposal to council in two weeks for you to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=456)|
| 0:07:42| Many of us remember that horrific fire early in February of 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=462)|
| 0:07:48| I was actually I think had been community development director for about five weeks when that fire happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=468)|
| 0:07:55| and I think we spent something like a million dollars with the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=475)|
| 0:08:00| and all of our emergency responders in dealing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=480)|
| 0:08:06| Since then, there have been all kinds of legal issues that have kept the property from productive use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| but we believe this agreement is going to get us down the path to be able to purchase a property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| issue an RFP, and get this property in the hands of developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=496)|
| 0:08:22| who will finish the great revival work that's going on already around there on Gay Street, on Jackson Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=502)|
| 0:08:30| and bring some good neighbors to those who've already taken the plunge and made an investment in trying to rebuild our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| So we're very excited about that and look forward to talking about it some more in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| And also, finally, I want to let you all know that tomorrow I'm actually heading up to Washington, D.C., for the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=522)|
| 0:08:49| The First Lady, Michelle Obama, has invited me and several other elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| from cities who are involved with the Let's Move program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=534)|
| 0:08:57| You all are familiar with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| We've had several Let's Move activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| Knoxville and Knox County are actually tied for number one with a couple other cities in the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=540)|
| 0:09:06| for reaching the goals that they set out in that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| You all know some of our students from Sarah Moore Green have been up to the White House| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| as part of the whole addressing obesity and physical activity issues, eating healthy foods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| So the First Lady has an eye on Knoxville and has invited us to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=560)|
| 0:09:28| I'll be speaking on a panel with three other elected officials and others will be there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| We'll be talking about what we've learned, our experiences, and how to improve the Let's Move initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| Also, we'll be meeting first with a number of officials at the National League of Cities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=579)|
| 0:09:44| So I'll be going up tomorrow for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| And I really want to thank our Parks and Recreation staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=587)|
| 0:09:52| Is Joe Walsh here? Hey, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=592)|
| 0:09:55| He's really worked on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| Laurie, I see you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| And Kathleen Gibby, she'll be heading up with me tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| She's also really been actively involved, taking the lead on a lot of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=599)|
| 0:10:03| So we hope to represent the city well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| That is the end of my report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| And Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=608)|
| 0:10:09| Thank you, Madam Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| We've got two visiting Boy Scout troops tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=611)|
| 0:10:14| First is Troop 146.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=614)|
| 0:10:17| They're here earning or working towards their Citizenship in the Community badge right over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| Would you all stand up, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=621)|
| 0:10:23| Over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| And in this corner we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| In the other corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| Yeah, Troop 1882 from South Knoxville, near and dear to my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| They're working on two badges tonight, the Citizenship in Community and their Communication badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=639)|
| 0:10:44| So if you'll stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=644)|
| 0:10:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=651)|
| 0:10:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| We're glad to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Any other council reports?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=659)|
| 0:11:00| Well, we'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=660)|
| 0:11:02| Item 7B is a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute change order number 2 to contract number C-1332| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=662)|
| 0:11:09| with Design and Construction Services, Inc. for the Third Creek Greenway bridge replacement project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| increasing the contract price by $36,199.10 for a new contract total of $232,722.10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=674)|
| 0:11:24| and extending the completion date to July 31, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| Yes, good morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| Jim is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=693)|
| 0:11:35| Obviously an important project and activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| Curious, though, why we're spending $3,600 on conservation seed for grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=698)|
| 0:11:45| I mean, can't we buy, like, Kentucky's SQ81?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| That seems like a lot of money for grass seed to a country boy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| What's that about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| I'm Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| The conservation seed is actually required because it's part of a stream restoration easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=719)|
| 0:12:07| Tennessee's stream mitigation program has an easement on it that requires the natives to be planted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=727)|
| 0:12:18| So it's kind of rare seed because it's not used for production kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=738)|
| 0:12:22| Yeah, it's not used for production.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| It's just more expensive to produce the seed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=744)|
| 0:12:30| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| I saw that and I thought, jeepers creepers, I don't understand a lot of those charges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| but that one seemed like it could do a whole lot of grass seeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| Well, considering how much of that creek got restored,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=758)|
| 0:12:44| they must have spent probably tens of thousands of dollars on seed to begin with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=764)|
| 0:12:50| when they did that restoration project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=770)|
| 0:12:52| So we're just patching the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| You're just filling in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| Right, we're just patching the area that we affected when we did the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| I do want to say I've ridden the greenway in the new bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| I think the improvements you made are outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| You took out that sharp little hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=788)|
| 0:13:10| And good job, Lori and Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| I think that was a great addition and really made it a lot nicer down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=793)|
| 0:13:17| Really nice job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=797)|
| 0:13:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=801)|
| 0:13:22| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=803)|
| 0:13:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=804)|
| 0:13:25| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=805)|
| 0:13:26| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=807)|
| 0:13:28| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a contract with Gobus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=808)|
| 0:13:31| and Company LLC to provide professional consulting services to assist the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| in evaluating requests for proposals for the management of the city of Knoxville's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| transit system in an amount not to exceed $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=828)|
| 0:13:49| This resolution sort of caught my eye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=829)|
| 0:13:56| You know, we're retaining a company to consult in evaluating the proposals for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=836)|
| 0:14:02| management of the transit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=842)|
| 0:14:05| But as I looked at the materials, I thought this is really a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| This company seems to have extensive experience with these type of contracts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=851)|
| 0:14:17| and there seems to be a lot gained from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| But I had a good conversation with Ms. Branscom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| I'd just like to ask her to explain how we came to this, to making this step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=862)|
| 0:14:29| and what are some of the benefits we hope to achieve from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| And I'll start this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=874)|
| 0:14:35| Jim York may want to jump in at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=875)|
| 0:14:37| But what happened is the city put out an RFP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=877)|
| 0:14:40| We published it in April for the management of our transit services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| We got four proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| When our evaluation committee started reviewing those proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| we realized there was a lot we did not understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| And they used a lot of terms, for example, called spare ratios, run cutting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=891)|
| 0:14:56| standby hours versus total operating hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| This is transit lingo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| So it was very hard for us when we were doing the evaluations to really understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| what some of these terms were, what the value and meaning of these terms were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=905)|
| 0:15:10| So typically a municipality would have a staff person who would be a transit administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=910)|
| 0:15:15| and they would represent the city's interest in managing the public transit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| We do not have that position here at the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| So when we realized we needed this, we went out and had to put an RFP out for a consultant first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=922)|
| 0:15:30| So the consultant is going to work with us, and we do have a really qualified company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| We had narrowed it down to two and decided that Gopas was the best,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| and they were, I think, above and beyond the other qualifiers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=938)|
| 0:15:42| So we're really excited to be working with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=942)|
| 0:15:45| But they're going to be working with us to evaluate our proposals, conduct interviews,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=945)|
| 0:15:50| and then guide our contract negotiations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| But, again, this was really necessary to be able to understand what these proposals even meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=954)|
| 0:15:59| It was very hard to compare apples to apples when you don't understand the transit lingo like we would want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=959)|
| 0:16:05| So does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| And I'll add, it's even getting more complicated as the funding structures are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| So it's, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=976)|
| 0:16:18| As I read this, I was very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| I think this is a smart dollar move on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| In the city, we can't be experts in every area that we manage and are responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| I think the transit system and public transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| and looking beyond the city limits of the city of Knoxville is going to become increasingly important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=993)|
| 0:16:39| And we are the leaders in that area right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| and I really think it's crucial that we have a well-managed, efficient system that uses all that lingo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1002)|
| 0:16:49| and knows what it means so that we can move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1009)|
| 0:16:52| So I really applaud this effort, and I echo Councilman Stair's thoughts on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1012)|
| 0:16:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| I guess I'll shorten my remarks because I think the other two councilpersons have really hit the highlights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1021)|
| 0:17:07| But the thing that strikes me the most and I hope our citizens realize is that our transit system provides a very valuable service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1027)|
| 0:17:16| to people who, you know, don't get around by automobile and they have to get to work, they have to shop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| they have to visit people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1042)|
| 0:17:24| And the transit system does that for them, but it doesn't break even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1044)|
| 0:17:29| It doesn't make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| It has to be fed, you know, $12 million to $14 million a year to keep running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1050)|
| 0:17:35| And so when I first saw why are we, you know, a consultant we're going to hire for $40,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| I wondered, jeepers, we could do that in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| But really, if we can find in our evaluations a management entity that we're bidding to acquire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1063)|
| 0:17:52| that can save us money, the opportunities for saved costs are really tremendous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1072)|
| 0:17:57| So, again, I think it's wise that we've done this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| I think that sometimes you can save a few pennies and lose the pounds, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1080)|
| 0:18:06| So this is a good move that we can maybe minimize some of the costs we don't have to be expending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1095)|
| 0:18:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1096)|
| 0:18:17| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| Item 7D is a resolution supporting ETHRA's designation by the FTA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| as a direct recipient for a portion of the urbanized area formula grant funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| received by the City of Knoxville as its area's designated recipient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| and authorizing the mayor and ETHRA to execute any and all documents necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| for ETHRA to file a grant application for $176,500 of fiscal year 2013-5307 funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1116)|
| 0:18:46| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| Ms. O'Connor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| This particular resolution is extremely important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1130)|
| 0:18:53| After the 2010 census, the urbanized area was redefined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1133)|
| 0:18:58| and ETHRA suddenly found a good part of its service area was inside the urbanized area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1138)|
| 0:19:03| but its funding did not come from a source that would allow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| So as CAT, CAC, and ETHRA are all working through a new funding system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1147)|
| 0:19:15| new boundaries, and new requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| ETHRA was caught between a real rock and a hard spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1158)|
| 0:19:22| I think a real positive out of all of this angst over funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| has been that other counties that have taken these services for granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1166)|
| 0:19:31| are now very aware that they need to become more engaged in funding transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1171)|
| 0:19:38| and ETHRA provides transportation for people to go to things like dialysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| heart conditioning, and medical, generally medical kinds of things, appointments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| And so it's really crucial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1190)|
| 0:19:52| And the other good thing is this is not taking dollars from our system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| It's taking dollars in a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1196)|
| 0:19:59| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1200)|
| 0:20:01| This is a pot of money that is for the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| And so, you know, as time goes on, we will have another request for projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1204)|
| 0:20:12| and we'll be reviewing applications probably from ETHRA, CAC, and CAT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| for the use of the 5307 funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1217)|
| 0:20:20| So this is part of the complicated funding structure that I mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| and we're working closely with TPO to help us manage that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1224)|
| 0:20:32| But it's a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| We have a good relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| We've got ETHRA representative here, and I've met with some of the other county mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| and we've got a good working relationship to resolve these transit issues both in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| and in the surrounding counties in our urbanized area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| So with that, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1249)|
| 0:20:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1254)|
| 0:20:55| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| And so 11E is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into an agreement with Ross Fowler PC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1256)|
| 0:21:01| for professional preliminary engineering and design services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| to create a feasibility assessment report for several greenway corridors in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1264)|
| 0:21:09| for an amount not to exceed $197,900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1273)|
| 0:21:14| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| I see that Joe is here, and I hope you will wander up to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| My question, let me back up and say that I think this is a great idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| that you're getting some front-end engineering to put you in a better position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| maybe to get grant money or other sources of money to build out trails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| and I commend you for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| My question deals with page 122, but the page doesn't matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| but it deals with the corridors you've selected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1299)|
| 0:21:43| and I was hoping to see in the list of nominees that would get some love,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1303)|
| 0:21:48| maybe either the Holston River Trail or the Loves Creek Trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| but I didn't see it in that list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| and I was hoping you could squeeze another greenway in there somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| Well, Joe Walsh, Parks and Recreation Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| We were very selective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| We could have done 30 or 40 trail connectors, but we had to pick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| so we picked these 12, which we felt 12 we've been working on for a long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1327)|
| 0:22:11| long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| With that said, as Ross Fowler gets into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| and luckily the grant was for $250,000, and our contracts were $197,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1336)|
| 0:22:24| so maybe later on as we get further into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1344)|
| 0:22:26| we might have some leeway to move on beyond the original 12 that we're studying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| I'd like to see you share some love with the 4th District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| but it is a good program that we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| and I'm all in favor of building greenways everywhere in the city, not just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| I will point out, you probably noticed it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| but we do have one proposal to try to connect where James White Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| currently ends beneath the Ed McWhorter Park over to Holston River Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| which is a pretty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| Right, and you are doing the Williams Creek Trail segment, too, it looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| Correct, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| So I think we've got a pretty good spread all across the city of Holston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1383)|
| 0:23:04| And like I said, I think it's a very good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1385)|
| 0:23:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1386)|

| 0:24:10| in an amount not to exceed $11,000 for a new contract price of $393,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1450)|
| 0:24:16| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1456)|
| 0:24:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1457)|
| 0:24:18| Councilman Dellavope?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| Yes, if we have Bob here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| Yeah, Bob Wetzel is with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1462)|
| 0:24:25| I know we have done a lot of Phase I work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| and I know that this is an attempt to step it up and do some Phase II for particular parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| Could you just spend a minute and tell us about this and why we're doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| Let me ask Anne Wallace who's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| I'm going to let Anne step up and answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| She can give you a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| Good evening, Mayor and members of the Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| Anne Wallace, 400 Main Street, Office of Redevelopment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| managing the brownfields program for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| The reason for this is that basically with the work that was done at the former Baptist Hospital facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| additional grant monies were set aside on that assessment to look at lead-based paint and asbestos surveys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1497)|
| 0:25:05| so that we could really get a full understanding of the scope of the impact of the hospital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1505)|
| 0:25:11| reuse or demolition as necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| And so additional grant funds were used in that manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| and therefore there were not enough grant funds to finish out this Phase II| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1517)|
| 0:25:21| with the original budget as we allocated with EPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| I'm pleased to announce that EPA has approved the transition of these funds for this purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1524)|
| 0:25:30| and it does still fall within our existing grant amount of $400,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1530)|
| 0:25:35| so we're not needing any additional funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| We're just reallocating funds that were originally programmed for things like travel or flyers and other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1537)|
| 0:25:44| All right, but aside from the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1544)|
| 0:25:46| isn't this enabling our city to have these properties more ready to get developed or redeveloped by the marketplace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1546)|
| 0:25:55| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| In fact, the Baptist Hospital site is a great example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1556)|
| 0:25:59| We had six parcels that were included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| and that included both Phase I's and Phase II's for some of the parcels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| as well as the lead-based paint and asbestos surveys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| and it was one of the reasons that Blanchard and Calhoun has come to Knoxville interested in that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1570)|
| 0:26:15| because they knew what they were getting into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| To take out some of the guesswork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| This property specifically is for the KCDC property that will be part of the Setre Landing Park development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| and so we want to make sure that we get all of those environmental questions answered before we start construction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1592)|
| 0:26:33| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| Item 11-I is a resolution approving a tax increment financing amendment to the Gay Street redevelopment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| and urban renewal plan prepared by Knoxville's Community Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| to support the redevelopment of real property located at 412, 414, and 416 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| Councilman Della Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| Yes, this one must be yours, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| And I just wanted to say I know you've already answered this to some degree by e-mail and whatnot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1619)|
| 0:27:04| but I think all of us are going to be asked why a 20-year term for this TIF, that's a little longer than we'd like to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1624)|
| 0:27:11| and maybe you can just give us the rationale so that we can explain it to others when we are asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| A couple of things there, and I did send out an e-mail to everybody today kind of giving the basics on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1637)|
| 0:27:23| Keep in mind a TIF is different from a pilot, and a pilot, you know, we're kind of freezing things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| so we try to do that for a shorter period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| With the TIF loan, we actually generate all the new taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| And so as those new tax dollars come in, they pay off that loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| So this loan could potentially get paid off in 10, 12, 15, 20 years, depending on how the tax flow comes in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1657)|
| 0:27:43| The bottom line of this one is the banker for the project would not have gone forward unless he had the security of knowing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| this note would be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| We're not at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1671)|
| 0:27:52| The developer is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| So it's a go, no-go kind of thing in terms of the financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1674)|
| 0:27:58| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1678)|
| 0:27:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| Did you work to try to get it lower than 50 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| We had many meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1684)|
| 0:28:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| This has been a very hard deal to put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1686)|
| 0:28:08| This is a very challenging property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1688)|
| 0:28:10| I know the building has sat empty for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| It's really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1692)|
| 0:28:13| It's a challenging property, and we've come together with the developer, and we've got a package in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| and I hope we can just move forward and get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| You're going to love what we see at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| It is a prime piece of real estate that we need to get redeveloped, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1701)|
| 0:28:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1706)|
| 0:28:27| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| 12G is an ordinance to rezone property located on the south side of Asheville Highway east of Ruggles Drive from C3 to C4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1712)|

| 0:28:45| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1728)|
| 0:28:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1732)|
| 0:28:53| 12H is an ordinance to close an unnamed alley from the eastern boundary of parcel 107NJ3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1733)|

| 0:29:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| Now, we do have Mr. Seymour signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1757)|
| 0:29:21| Do you wish to hear him first, Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| You're not going to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| He does what he told me he was before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1766)|
| 0:29:30| If you do the right thing, we won't have to hear from Mr. Seymour tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1770)|
| 0:29:34| Is that right, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| If I say this correctly, we will have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1776)|
| 0:29:38| Let's see if you can do this, Mr. Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1778)|
| 0:29:46| I'd like to make a substitute motion for a substitute ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| that each of you should have in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1789)|
| 0:29:51| You should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| I think that was handed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1793)|
| 0:29:55| I think that's probably a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1795)|
| 0:29:59| I'm sorry, a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1804)|
| 0:30:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1805)|
| 0:30:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1808)|
| 0:30:09| We have a motion to amend, and that would be with the revised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1809)|
| 0:30:16| With the revised version of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1816)|
| 0:30:18| Essentially, we'll close this right-of-way that exists primarily on paper anyway, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1818)|
| 0:30:25| And initially, it was closed subject to a number of conditions, including the installation of a turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| And since this wasn't something that was actually being used on the ground, the turnaround was not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1832)|
| 0:30:38| And the engineering department has reviewed that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| and determined that even though in ordinary circumstances, if they were closing an alley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1841)|
| 0:30:46| this is the kind of thing that they would require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| Because of the certain circumstances involved in this case, it was unnecessary to have those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| And so they have deleted those requirements that this ordinance was subject to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1854)|
| 0:31:00| So it is no longer subject to those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| You took the words right out of my mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| I just want to double-dare Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| You're ahead now, but do you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1872)|
| 0:31:14| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1874)|
| 0:31:15| You have a free shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1875)|

| 0:31:56| We have one person signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1916)|

| 0:32:05| Let me get my timer out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1925)|
| 0:32:06| You know the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1926)|
| 0:32:07| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1928)|
| 0:32:09| I get five minutes from here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1929)|
| 0:32:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| Vinny Anastacio, 21 Logan Street, apartment 1011, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1931)|
| 0:32:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| I want to thank the city council for the approval of F and also D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1937)|
| 0:32:26| because I know a lot of people ride the EFRA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1946)|
| 0:32:30| and also I go by Fort Lauderdale Lake a lot, and it stinks over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| It really does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| It stinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| I mean, because you've got the buoys underneath there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1958)|
| 0:32:40| and where the Tennessee Grill was, I mean, underneath there, it stinks so bad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| you walk by it and the smell is intense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| I mean, that's how bad it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| When the city put up the $5 million for the sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| how come the whole sidewalk was not done, just part of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1976)|
| 0:33:01| Like what I'm saying is like the corners, you know, like for wheelchair people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| And then the Knox County Commissioner Brown wants term limits on the school board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| and I wanted to know what are your feelings on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| And last one, I have a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| This is right up Mr. Della Volpe's alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=1998)|
| 0:33:22| My suggestion is to raise money for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| Raise the price of parking tickets from $11 to $30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| I don't have an alley there, but that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| It's just a figure of speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2016)|

| 0:33:43| So, Councilman Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| I was just curious what exactly the sidewalks you were talking about that weren't finished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| do you all know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2029)|
| 0:33:50| He didn't specify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| I'm talking like on 5th Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2033)|
| 0:33:57| It's like you got part of it on 5th Avenue across the street from the old Knoxville High| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2037)|
| 0:34:03| where it's like up, and I thought that they were going to do the whole sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| You know, and across the street where the old Knoxville High was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| they did like just like they put like a ramp, and then they just did one little piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2051)|
| 0:34:17| You know what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2057)|
| 0:34:18| Well, sir, if you would, Mr. Hagerman, Jim, raise your hand there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2058)|
| 0:34:24| If you would speak to him afterwards, then he can, if he doesn't know this off the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| he can certainly look it up for you and explain to you what the situation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2074)|
| 0:34:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2075)|
| 0:34:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| There being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130709?start=2077)|
