| 0:01:08| All right, we've got just about a full house this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=68)|
| 0:01:10| Welcome to the 1200th workshop on pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=70)|
| 0:01:13| I think we're about to wind it down here, but that being said, I'll just go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=73)|
| 0:01:19| turn it over to Madam Mayor and let her address the council here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=79)|
| 0:01:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=84)|
| 0:01:25| And this is working, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=85)|
| 0:01:26| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=86)|
| 0:01:28| I'll just sit right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=88)|
| 0:01:29| So good evening, council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| Thank you for this workshop about pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| Actually we thought we'd maybe wound it all down in our last pension board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=94)|
| 0:01:37| I think we identified something else that might need a charter amendment in two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=97)|
| 0:01:42| but I don't know about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=102)|
| 0:01:45| Anyway, you all, we sent to the ballot last November five charter amendments related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=105)|
| 0:01:52| the pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=112)|
| 0:01:53| And so the first one, you might recall, was what we basically called the housekeeping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=113)|
| 0:01:59| kind of clarifying legal language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| One part of that had to do with the interest rate for refunds and moving it from the pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=122)|
| 0:02:08| system from the charter over to the supplemental plan provisions, which you all vote on and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=128)|
| 0:02:14| approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=134)|
| 0:02:15| And so this has to do with setting the interest rate on refunds to a reasonable market rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=135)|
| 0:02:20| not to exceed 4% rather than the current flat 4% that's in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=140)|
| 0:02:25| So that's the first, that was the first charter amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| And all of these amendments passed overwhelmingly by the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| And Kathy is always, correct me if I say anything wrong, or Kristi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=154)|
| 0:02:40| Our Kathy Aeslinger, our attorney for the pension board, and Kristi Pakowski, our executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=160)|
| 0:02:45| director is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=165)|
| 0:02:46| The second charter amendment had to do with weighing a lump sum payment option, alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=166)|
| 0:02:52| forms of benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| We are not talking about that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| That's another whole issue that's going to require a lot more research of pros and cons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| So we are not addressing the charter amendment number two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| And we're not required, there's no need to rush into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| City charter amendment number three had to do with giving employees nearing retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=190)|
| 0:03:16| more flexibility in selecting alternative interest options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=196)|
| 0:03:20| That will be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=200)|
| 0:03:21| This is something that is a change to supplemental plan provisions, so we will talk about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=205)|
| 0:03:27| City charter amendment number four had to do with the lifetime annuities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=207)|
| 0:03:31| And we will be addressing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| As you know, what we sent to the, what the charter says now is the default is spouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| But council has the authority to add others to that if you deem it necessary or feasible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=220)|
| 0:03:49| And so we had talked about the potential of disabled dependents being added for lifetime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=229)|
| 0:03:55| annuities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| And that is what we're going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| The pension board is recommending some wording related to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=237)|
| 0:04:02| And then the charter amendment number five had to do with expanding membership on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=242)|
| 0:04:05| pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=245)|
| 0:04:06| That was what we've already accomplished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=246)|
| 0:04:09| It was my responsibility to bring two names to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| We did that at the last meeting, I think it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| And the folks will become, will begin on the pension board on February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=255)|
| 0:04:23| So bottom line, there are three of those charter amendments that we are addressing tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=263)|
| 0:04:30| And what we are bringing you is the recommendation from the majority of the pension board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=270)|
| 0:04:35| And of course, Councilman Saunders is on that board as well, and he can also answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=275)|
| 0:04:40| questions and add color and flavor to what we're going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=280)|
| 0:04:44| So are there any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| I'm going to hand, to ask Kathy to go ahead and walk through, they're in a little different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=287)|
| 0:04:53| I think the paper you have is in a little different order than I just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| But Kathy will start with the definition of beneficiary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| And I guess I should ask, do you have copies of the amendment, it was sent out by email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=303)|
| 0:05:12| but maybe that we need to get some copies so that you have something to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=312)|
| 0:05:17| Somebody, I've got my copy, I can hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=317)|
| 0:05:20| We're sharing this one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| I've got to share with Nick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| You've got to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| Play nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| You can share with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| You don't have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| No, I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=328)|
| 0:05:29| There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=329)|
| 0:05:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=330)|
| 0:05:31| Does Tim Mardino have some?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=331)|
| 0:05:33| Do you all have it over there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=333)|
| 0:05:35| Yeah, we got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=335)|
| 0:05:36| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=336)|
| 0:05:37| Where are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| So we're starting off with what is titled the first amendment to the 2013 amended and restated supplemental plan provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=338)|
| 0:05:47| And we'll go through that section by section so that we can point out exactly what is being changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=347)|
| 0:05:56| And under number one, the first thing that this amendment does is it adds a definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=356)|
| 0:06:03| a new definition of beneficiary to the supplemental plan provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| And that definition would apply for purposes of benefits payable upon retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=367)|
| 0:06:14| or death in the form of a joint and survivor annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| And it limits the beneficiary for that purpose to either the spouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| which is what the charter says, or a new category that we're calling a disabled dependent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=382)|
| 0:06:30| And rather than getting into, you know, specific definitions of what these terms mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=390)|
| 0:06:39| then the supplemental plan provisions rely on the definitions that are already provided by the Internal Revenue Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=399)|
| 0:06:49| and are used frequently in employee benefit plans in, you know, determining who is in fact a dependent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=409)|
| 0:06:55| And so the dependent would be an individual who would meet the definition of a dependent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| under the Internal Revenue Code section 152.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| That's your standard child or qualifying relative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=424)|
| 0:07:10| And then also to be a beneficiary, then the person would also need to be disabled in addition to being a dependent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=430)|
| 0:07:18| And the definition of disability would then be tied to the Internal Revenue Code section 22E3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=438)|
| 0:07:26| which is the fairly standard definition of disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=446)|
| 0:07:30| And I have that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=450)|
| 0:07:32| That would be a person who is permanently and totally disabled if he is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=452)|
| 0:07:42| by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=466)|
| 0:07:49| or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=469)|
| 0:07:55| The pension board would have the authority to determine if a beneficiary meets that definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=475)|
| 0:08:03| And the person who wanted to designate a disabled dependent would have to submit proof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| at the time they made the beneficiary designation that an individual did qualify under this disabled dependent requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=489)|
| 0:08:21| Are there any specific questions on those provisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| Yeah, I've got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=505)|
| 0:08:27| I was ahead of you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=507)|
| 0:08:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=515)|
| 0:08:37| You said a child in terms of dependent or other qualifying relative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=517)|
| 0:08:42| What is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| You can do it in plain English instead of reading the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=525)|
| 0:08:48| Yeah, that's where I was going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=528)|
| 0:08:50| It would include your siblings, brothers, sisters, your parents, grandparents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=530)|
| 0:08:55| It could be step-parents, nieces, nephews, aunts, uncles, in-laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=535)|
| 0:09:02| You know, about every category of relative is covered by the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=542)|
| 0:09:06| Doesn't that almost swallow the thing that we were limiting it to spouses or such other person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| Because they have to be disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| They have to be disabled, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=553)|
| 0:09:15| Have we looked at something like helping them set up a trust or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| so that they can provide money that will sustain the child as opposed to putting the city taxpayers at risk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=559)|
| 0:09:27| That's certainly not something that would be accomplished through the supplemental plan provisions or the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=567)|
| 0:09:34| You know, certainly an individual would have that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=574)|
| 0:09:38| Let me just add that, again, remember they have to be dependent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| If it's a relative, they have to be dependent on the employee as the IRS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| you know, financially dependent as the IRS would approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| and they have to be disabled per the IRS regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=593)|
| 0:09:57| You have to meet those first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| And also remember that 0.8% of our employees currently can even afford to choose a lifetime annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=599)|
| 0:10:09| Isn't that right, Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=609)|
| 0:10:10| We looked at that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| Most people, because even to do this, you have to take a cut in your monthly retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=611)|
| 0:10:18| in order to accommodate anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| Now, if it's a spouse close to your age, it's not as much of a cut as if it's a child or grandchild.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=622)|
| 0:10:29| So even now, I mean, in this case, if you have a disabled, a dependent disabled child that would qualify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=629)|
| 0:10:39| you're still taking a pretty major cut in your monthly payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=639)|
| 0:10:45| in order to have this disabled dependent for a lifetime child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| I don't quarrel with that, but now we've shifted a personal obligation to the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=649)|
| 0:10:54| and we were talking about maybe getting away from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=654)|
| 0:10:57| and I realize this may be a very small percentage, maybe it's just theoretical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=657)|
| 0:11:01| but it just strikes me that we've gone back to a system that puts the taxpayer at risk for family issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=661)|
| 0:11:10| rather than getting a pension for a worker who works for our city and wants to retire in dignity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=670)|
| 0:11:18| I mean, that strikes me as at least...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| Well, I think the reason why this was done, Councilman, is that the biggest issues that sort of were raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=682)|
| 0:11:29| and that people seemed to have some sympathy for were disabled children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=689)|
| 0:11:36| No, I don't quarrel with the sympathy factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| It's obviously human nature to want to take care of someone who's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| Well, certainly this is up for council to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=704)|
| 0:11:45| It's something that you all have to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=705)|
| 0:11:47| Do you think a dependent disabled relative should be included or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=707)|
| 0:11:54| Based on what we heard in the meetings and what sort of we felt the general consensus was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| there was some willingness to cover that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=719)|
| 0:12:03| But certainly, you know, that's up to you all to decide if you think...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=723)|
| 0:12:08| I don't know if Councilman Saunders wants to reply as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=728)|
| 0:12:13| Like I said, it's rare whether, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| and maybe there's other kinds of limitations, restrictions or something that could be put on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| You know, it's really up to you all to give us some direction on what you think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| But this is the Pension Board's recommendation to you at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| Yeah, that was an item that we talked a long time about at the Pension Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| When we came to this decision and given some other change today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=755)|
| 0:12:42| this will be the motion that will come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=762)|
| 0:12:46| And I would also point out under that IRS definition that is referenced in the supplemental plan provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=766)|
| 0:12:55| the disabled dependent, you know, can't be providing, you know, more than half of their own support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=775)|
| 0:13:03| Essentially, the employee that's designating that person as a beneficiary has to provide at least half of the support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=783)|
| 0:13:11| of the individual that they are designating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| And then in addition to that, I would point out, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=794)|
| 0:13:19| while we're talking about paragraph five on the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=799)|
| 0:13:22| the very last thing that this amendment does is it revises the actuarial factors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=802)|
| 0:13:29| and specifically to take into account the mandatory cost of living adjustments that are in the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=809)|
| 0:13:37| And it reduces the benefit that would be payable to that employee and to the beneficiary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=817)|
| 0:13:44| even further than it is currently by taking into account that COLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=824)|
| 0:13:51| Let me call on Councilman Grieve here before we go any further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| What's your definition of spouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=835)|
| 0:13:58| Does this cover same-sex married couples?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=838)|
| 0:14:01| How does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| In other words, I mean, my definition of spouse may be different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| but I'm curious because we have that benefit in the city, so how are you dealing with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| and do you have a definition of spouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| There is not a definition of spouse anywhere in the charter or in the supplemental plan provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| Should there be something that explains about partnerships and this sort of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=862)|
| 0:14:28| The IRS has recently come out with some guidance on how a qualified retirement plan must interpret spouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=868)|
| 0:14:37| The general rule is that for IRS purposes, for qualified plan purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=877)|
| 0:14:44| a spouse would include a same-sex spouse if the individuals were married in a jurisdiction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=884)|
| 0:14:52| that recognizes same-sex marriage even if they live in a state that doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| That particular issue has not yet come up before the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| and at an appropriate time the board will have to make a determination as to what it means under the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=901)|
| 0:15:08| And for purposes of this qualified plan, this is a qualified plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| Obviously the city wants it to remain a qualified plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| and we would offer advice consistent with the IRS guidance to make sure we stay qualified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=916)|
| 0:15:24| So the bottom line is it does not include domestic partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| Spouse does not mean domestic partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=928)|
| 0:15:31| It means, and Kathy, make sure I'm saying this right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=931)|
| 0:15:36| but I believe a spouse in the state of Tennessee is one man, one woman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=936)|
| 0:15:42| I mean, that's a marriage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| But again, if in fact a same-sex couple is married, you cannot be married in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=944)|
| 0:15:51| but you can be married in some other state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| So if they move to Tennessee, Tennessee might not recognize them, but the IRS does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=953)|
| 0:15:59| and therefore a same-sex married couple by IRS regulations might be recognized as a spouse in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=959)|
| 0:16:10| But domestic partners are not a part of our definition of spouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| Should they be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| Well, my opinion is no, because we do offer domestic partner benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| I did that for insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| But for lifetime annuities, it seems to me that there are many other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=987)|
| 0:16:34| If you're in a domestic partner, whether it's a same-sex or opposite-sex relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=994)|
| 0:16:38| you can still leave your partner the 5-, 10-, or 15-year option that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=998)|
| 0:16:46| just like you can leave your child or children who are not disabled dependents, or even if they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1006)|
| 0:16:54| You know, we have other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| We're just talking here for about lifetime annuities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| So you all feel comfortable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| I personally do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| I mean, that wasn't really raised when we talked about this previously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| There are options if you have a partner that you want to leave it to, but we're talking about lifetime annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1028)|
| 0:17:15| And in the future, I mean, as I said, if you get married, if you're a same-sex couple, you get married in another state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1035)|
| 0:17:22| it appears that we will be able to recognize them per IRS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| Along that same lines, so we just put a sunset on the ability to name your children, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1049)|
| 0:17:39| I mean, that was the whole deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1059)|
| 0:17:41| For a lifetime annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1061)|
| 0:17:43| For a lifetime annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1063)|
| 0:17:44| So we just put the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1064)|
| 0:17:46| It also had actuarial tables that said it's reduced on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| and yet there was argument and discussion and proposals when we talked about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| but it still costs more money, you know, based on paying it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1078)|
| 0:18:03| So aren't we right back to the same type of situation here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| even though now we're saying, well, they're, you know, they're disabled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| and we've got another qualification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1091)|
| 0:18:13| Aren't we right back to where we were on that argument?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1093)|
| 0:18:17| And that we used to, that so many people voted on to, you know, that wanted to put the sunset on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1097)|
| 0:18:23| I think the population we're dealing with here would be far smaller, far smaller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| A disabled dependent, not just a dependent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1108)|
| 0:18:31| And it wasn't so much the population that the perception was, and we're right back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| I mean, I just think the timing of this is horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| I mean, we just went through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| People were excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| As you said, I mean, we so supported this amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| and then to come back and put it really pretty close to the average person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| it might look the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| I just think the timing of it's horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| I would only add, Councilman, that we actually repeated often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1131)|
| 0:18:57| that an exception might be disabled dependent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| That's something that has, it's not like it's out of the blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| Maybe, but I mean, what we said was, is it actuarially, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1145)|
| 0:19:09| it was said at the time when it was voted in years and years ago that it made no difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1149)|
| 0:19:15| and the reality was is it probably does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| I mean, I just think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| You've changed it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1161)|
| 0:19:22| You've tweaked it a little bit, but it just seems like you're right back on top of it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1162)|
| 0:19:26| I think it's really too soon to come back with a very similar type of amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1166)|
| 0:19:38| One other thing, just in case you missed, and again, that's for Council to decide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| but we consistently listed that as a potential for an exception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1183)|
| 0:19:49| and that's why we're bringing it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| As Kathy mentioned, the way it was, like now, when the tables are done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1192)|
| 0:20:00| I'm doing it in layperson's terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1200)|
| 0:20:02| Somebody might be able to say it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| The way the tables are calculated to see what you would get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1203)|
| 0:20:06| or what your dependent would get right now if your child was on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| it never factored in the automatic 3% floor to the COLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1209)|
| 0:20:16| And so we're changing that, that that does get factored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1216)|
| 0:20:22| So even today, say a child before and then a child now who is disabled dependent for life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1222)|
| 0:20:29| they would end up with less money, less payout than currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1229)|
| 0:20:35| because we are calculating in that automatic 3%, which wasn't done before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1235)|
| 0:20:40| which we discovered was not done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| But, I mean, I think that's up to you all to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1244)|
| 0:20:46| This is something that we have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| You know, we were asked when we went to the meetings and we discussed about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| we did mention that that, because we were asked what might be an exception,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1253)|
| 0:20:56| and we said a disabled dependent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1256)|
| 0:20:58| But truly, I mean, that's up for you all to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| whether you think it's something that should be offered or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| If it comes as a recommendation from the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| are you obligated to bring it to council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Well, I think we are bringing it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1273)|
| 0:21:19| Obviously, you can choose whether or not to vote for it, to support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1279)|
| 0:21:25| But we felt from a pension board's perspective, we had meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| Not only did we have the public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1289)|
| 0:21:31| but we had the meetings with employees to explain the changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| And one of the things that we heard, really the only, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| category where there was some sense that would be, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1299)|
| 0:21:44| the right thing to do would be long-term, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| permanent disabled dependents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| And that's why the pension board, you know, decided to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| you know, recommend this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| Finbar, I don't want to put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| Do you want to add to that in any way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| No, I mean, Wayne just asked me what is the universe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| I don't think we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1328)|
| 0:22:10| We don't have any idea right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1330)|
| 0:22:12| Do you have any now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| None now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1334)|
| 0:22:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1337)|
| 0:22:25| You know, I guess it would be appropriate if council had more questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| that could send it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| You know, you wouldn't have to vote on this whole document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| You could vote piece by piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| And if you had more questions, you had more research you wanted us to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1357)|
| 0:22:40| we would be glad to do that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| Where would we vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1363)|
| 0:22:45| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1365)|
| 0:22:46| How would we – so we could do that when it comes as an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1366)|
| 0:22:52| I mean, when it comes before council, we could send it back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1372)|
| 0:22:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| Is this already on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1376)|
| 0:22:58| It's for February 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1378)|
| 0:23:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| So we could actually – if the consensus is that you want us to do some more research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| we could pull this from the, you know, the ordinance that we bring, couldn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1388)|
| 0:23:18| Yes, we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1398)|
| 0:23:19| Well, I know many times in the past that we've broken certain parts of an ordinance out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| and, you know, dealt with it and left others out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| I mean, it's appropriate to do that or just not bring it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| I mean, I don't know what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| I don't know what your path would be to bring it back, but we can break it apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1415)|
| 0:23:40| Yeah, and that's why I asked, do you have to bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1420)|
| 0:23:42| I mean, they've made the recommendation, do you have to bring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| I mean, I hate to come off as some, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| callous person that doesn't care about disabled dependents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| but I'm just – you know, it's really close on the heels of having just voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| I just think it puts us in a really awkward position anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| Well, I would just say as chair of the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| I feel like I should bring the recommendation of the pension board to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| If you would tell – if you said today there are certain things you would like to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| you know, before you voted on this, then we could try and get you that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1453)|
| 0:24:17| or we could just bring this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1457)|
| 0:24:19| You all could choose to defer that back to us, you know, that section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| or you could vote it up or down, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| I mean, you know, we want to work with you on this, whatever you feel is best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| Yeah, but whatever we do, whatever changes we institute here, we must bring to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| If it's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| I mean, we're not going to change it without council's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| Well, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| I just thought, you know, I didn't know if that was at the mayor's discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| No, I'm not even going to bring that to council, or I am or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1491)|
| 0:24:54| I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| I mean, you're saying it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Yeah, well, this isn't me bringing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| This is, as the mayor said, this is the pension board that, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| throughout the process, that was the issue that some people raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1503)|
| 0:25:06| that should be perhaps an exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1506)|
| 0:25:08| And so that's why we have brought this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| Councilman Delva.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| Yeah, maybe just one more clarifying question or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| This is only the lifetime annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| You could still have a 5-, 10-, 15-year annuity for the disabled person, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| under the other existing rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| Currently they could do that, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| And we're talking about a lump sum distribution where I assume that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| if you went to an estate planner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1532)|
| 0:25:34| you could come up with a living trust that would pay a certain amount out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| and keep the rest in trust for the child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| You have options that are not pure pension plan options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| but the pension plan would facilitate like a lump sum distribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| Isn't that on the categories we're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| That is not in this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| It's not in this package?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| No, it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| That is one of the amendments that was approved in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1555)|
| 0:25:59| that gave the authority for council through the SPPs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| to have some additional forms of benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| That's something that the pension board wants to study and look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| So that's not ripe yet, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1569)|
| 0:26:11| So it's not ripe yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Currently that would not be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| The person would have to rely on the distribution options already set out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| All right, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1578)|
| 0:26:23| Any further questions from council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1583)|
| 0:26:26| Any comments from the administration or anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1586)|
| 0:26:31| Well, maybe just that interest thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| You started to talk about the interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| That's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1595)|
| 0:26:36| Oh, that's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| Yeah, there are several pieces here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| This was the first piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| So if you look at paragraph 2 on the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| that deals with the refund interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| This is the rate that is paid when a member takes a withdrawal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1608)|
| 0:26:53| of their employee contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1613)|
| 0:26:55| and for a very long time that's been set at 4% through the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| One of the amendments that was approved in November| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| was to give some authority to have a different rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| specified in the supplemental plan provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| that would have more market fluctuation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1629)|
| 0:27:14| and be a little more in line with what the market was truly bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1634)|
| 0:27:18| in this particular environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1638)|
| 0:27:20| And so what this does is it would tie that interest rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| to the Barclays U.S. 1 to 3 year government bond index| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1644)|
| 0:27:29| rather than have that set rate at 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| So it's actual to a cap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| And the pension board's investment advisor, Summit Strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1658)|
| 0:27:43| made the recommendation for that bond index as a good index for this purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1663)|
| 0:27:53| Questions on this particular issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1673)|
| 0:27:56| Just out of curiosity, do many people opt to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| to take the refund rather than take the pension itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1679)|
| 0:28:05| Or is that when you leave like you're 20 years old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1685)|
| 0:28:07| and you leave when you're 27 and you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| I'll go and take my money and put it in a 401K?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| Certainly if you are not vested, that's what ultimately you would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1692)|
| 0:28:18| Sometimes even individuals who are vested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| if maybe they haven't spent a lot of time with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| they think they may do better by taking their contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| Having access to the entire amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| Do they get the employer's portion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1713)|
| 0:28:34| Just what they paid in or was paid in on their behalf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1714)|
| 0:28:36| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Plus interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| Plus interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| Is it compounded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| It is a formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| It's based on each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| And what we do is we take the contributions for each year, add 4% to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| And then next year you add 4% to 104.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| So it is compounded annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1737)|
| 0:28:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Each individual year gets 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1740)|
| 0:29:02| So it's not compounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| But then going forward, it will be at the Barclays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| Barclays Ag one to three year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1753)|
| 0:29:15| Look at it annually and so you'll set the rate one time, figure it, move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| And by the way, this would become effective July 1, 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| This particular, if you all pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| And the reason we did it for July 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| is so that we could get people that have left their money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| we could notify them and give them plenty of time to go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1776)|
| 0:29:39| and take their money out if they wanted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1779)|
| 0:29:47| So the next two sections, paragraphs three and four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| deal with the alternative interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| This was the charter amendment that gave the authority through the SPPs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| to allow individuals in plan H or those with G1 individual accounts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1801)|
| 0:30:08| if they were within two years of their normal retirement age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1808)|
| 0:30:11| then they could make an irrevocable election for an alternative interest rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1811)|
| 0:30:18| to be credited to those accounts as opposed to whatever the fund earns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1818)|
| 0:30:24| which may be a really good rate, maybe it's negative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1824)|
| 0:30:30| But it gives a little more protection for those individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| who may think it's better to go ahead and take a really low interest rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1834)|
| 0:30:39| for the remainder of the time that they're going to work for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| to take some of that risk off the table for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| And this would also tie the interest rate to that same government bond index.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| Currently it is a very low percentage rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1852)|
| 0:30:55| It's, I think, around 0.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| Over the years it certainly has fluctuated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| It's, I think, back in 94 it may have been up around 7%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1862)|
| 0:31:08| but certainly it's not a high rate of interest at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1868)|
| 0:31:13| But those individuals, again, you would have to be within two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| of your normal retirement age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| You would have to make an irrevocable election to have this interest crediting rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| so they couldn't change their minds later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| even if they worked for the city for another ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| they're going to be stuck with that interest rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| which may be much lower than what the plan itself earns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1893)|
| 0:31:39| Just a couple questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| One is it refers to the normal retirement date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| Is that based on a person's age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| What is a normal retirement date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| It depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| It could be an age or it could be age plus year of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| Yes, it could be the rule of 80.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| It's when you're eligible to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Like in Plan C for our uniformed bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| theirs is 50 and 25 years of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| So this depends on which plan you're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1926)|
| 0:32:09| It's what your normal retirement is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| That's what they mean by normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| It's just when you first get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1932)|
| 0:32:15| When you're first eligible to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1935)|
| 0:32:17| The other question was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| I'm still trying to understand that you're taking out the stock market risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| by opting for a bond rate that's a snapshot of the time you're looking at it, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1942)|
| 0:32:30| I thought the pension amount was based on years of service times a factor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| which doesn't care whether the market made it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1955)|
| 0:32:37| so I don't understand what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1957)|
| 0:32:40| I thought I understood it when we voted on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| I'm trying to understand it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| This is just for those supplemental accounts for the G1 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| Oh, the ones they manage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| Yeah, where they have that defined contribution piece of G1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1969)|
| 0:32:53| Not the general plan itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| Okay, that clarifies it, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| And also for the H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| The hypothetical accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1982)|
| 0:33:10| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1990)|
| 0:33:16| The very last thing on this amendment is to change the actuarial factors in Appendix A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=1996)|
| 0:33:25| I know we made some changes just last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| but this was instigated as a result of the discussions regarding the beneficiaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2008)|
| 0:33:34| and to specifically take into account that mandatory COLA that's in the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2014)|
| 0:33:39| so that if there's a large difference between the ages of an individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| and the beneficiary there would be a further reduction to take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2024)|
| 0:33:52| Could you give an example?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| You've got an 18-year-old spouse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2036)|
| 0:33:59| Some people do have much younger spouses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2039)|
| 0:34:04| I don't have specific financial examples, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2044)|
| 0:34:12| I'll try and do this, and, again, this is ballpark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2052)|
| 0:34:15| but let's say that you were to retire under the old actuarial tables and you were to leave it to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2055)|
| 0:34:23| and I'll use the example of a child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| Let's say you were to receive $1,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| The actuarial hit on that might be price that down to, say, $850, $870 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2069)|
| 0:34:36| My guess is to the employee and then subsequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2076)|
| 0:34:42| My guess is this would probably ratchet it down maybe another $50, $60 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2082)|
| 0:34:51| Because the factors require more to be taken out for the secondary beneficiary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| Is that the idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Let's look at it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| If I were an employee and I were to retire, and, again, I'll use the $1,000 a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2100)|
| 0:35:06| as an employee without choosing the spousal connection or the child connection or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2106)|
| 0:35:16| I would receive the $1,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| By adding a spouse, if the spouse is significantly younger, I would take a hit off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2120)|
| 0:35:27| I wouldn't receive $1,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2127)|
| 0:35:29| I would receive, again, let's say, you know, maybe $900.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| If you left it to a child, it would probably drop it to maybe $850 or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| Because of the longer life of the residual?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2138)|
| 0:35:39| Because of the longer life and the longer life expectancy of those differences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| Now what will happen is because you're changing the actuarial tables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2145)|
| 0:35:49| that's going to lower that factor again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| In the example, let's say it was $850, it might drop it down to $790, $800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2151)|
| 0:35:58| Again, what this is, is you take a bigger cut off because of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| It's a little more conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2163)|
| 0:36:05| It's a lot more conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2165)|
| 0:36:07| Factors so that the fund isn't hurt, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2170)|
| 0:36:11| Well, again, we use the term actuarially neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2171)|
| 0:36:14| And presumably by taking that hit up front,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| and you're really looking at the present value of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2180)|
| 0:36:21| Because you gain a lot of present value because of the initial cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2181)|
| 0:36:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| And then obviously, you know, 25 years out, the present value of that is a lot less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| So, again, it's just working the numbers back to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| But in a sense, it's fund protective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2198)|
| 0:36:43| We lost Dwayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| Do you have any more questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| I don't see any lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| Those are all the amendments to the supplemental plan provisions that we have to present to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2213)|
| 0:37:00| We are bringing some changes to the investment policy that I will turn over to Christy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2220)|
| 0:37:07| and let her talk about a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| If there are no further questions, then on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2230)|
| 0:37:18| Let me just ask one clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| The mayor said if we have something we want you to look into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2241)|
| 0:37:26| do you need to know that now or when it comes before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| In other words, you go to work now and you clarify what you're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| What's the timing on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| Well, I guess what I would suggest now, just thinking about the conversation we just had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| is that this is a recommendation from the pension board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2259)|
| 0:37:41| I feel obligated to bring this to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2261)|
| 0:37:44| And so at the meeting where you consider it, if you wanted to break it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2264)|
| 0:37:48| and if you had more questions about, say, the beneficiary or any piece of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2268)|
| 0:37:53| then you might at that meeting then ask us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| vote for us to reconsider or to do whatever research that you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| And then we would go back and take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| Okay, so the timing is at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| You had sent to you the new investment policy summary that we had voted on as a board last Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2294)|
| 0:38:27| In that document, the only things that really changed, I did a quick summary of the changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| so you wouldn't have to really see the whole document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| So really what it does is it clarifies language on page 2 where we've added Division H,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2316)|
| 0:38:43| just so that that will be in there as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| until we break out H into its own separate policy in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2326)|
| 0:38:52| And then basically what we're trying to do as the investment committee of the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2332)|
| 0:38:58| is to evaluate and bring more diversification and de-risk the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2338)|
| 0:39:09| And so we've added these two different strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2349)|
| 0:39:15| that the pension board believes is a good move to de-risk the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2355)|
| 0:39:21| And so we've added risk parity as a separate asset class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2361)|
| 0:39:26| We had gone into that space as part of hedge funds, but it's really its own strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2366)|
| 0:39:33| So we broke it out so it would be more clear in the investment policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2373)|
| 0:39:37| And then we added language into the fixed income to add emerging market debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2377)|
| 0:39:46| which we have also already funded as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| But it just clarifies what emerging market meant and what those items are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2391)|
| 0:39:59| and that we would not go into anything that's below investment grade bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2399)|
| 0:40:04| So basically that's what that is, is that we're trying to de-risk the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| and bring that in more in line to reduce as much volatility as we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| by still meeting the 7 and 3-8s at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| Mr. Chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2420)|
| 0:40:22| I think I understood what you said about the second one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| but it was in a little bit of techno speak there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2424)|
| 0:40:28| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2428)|
| 0:40:29| Well, no, the idea is that part of the money is managed by hedge fund kind of approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2429)|
| 0:40:37| as opposed to a specific stock ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| And you're saying that that manager of the riskier funds could leave some in cash| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2440)|
| 0:40:46| rather than invest it in maybe too risky a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2446)|
| 0:40:52| Is that what you're saying or have I just totally missed it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2452)|
| 0:40:55| Number two, the risk parity of the asset class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2455)|
| 0:41:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2460)|
| 0:41:02| Take another run at that if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| Let me get my risk parity definition out for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2463)|
| 0:41:08| Let me say this for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| Sure, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| You know, when you take a fund like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| the way you reduce your risk is through diversification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| Through a lot of different instruments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| Hedge funds are one of those instruments, and there are several others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| However, if you look at any single investment vehicle within the fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2482)|
| 0:41:29| there may be some higher risk, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2489)|
| 0:41:35| So you've got to look at the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| You can't just look at all the parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2496)|
| 0:41:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2498)|
| 0:41:39| And that's where we are trying our best to de-risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2499)|
| 0:41:44| the word that Christy just used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2504)|
| 0:41:47| So it's the mix of funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| Oh, it's a mix of a lot of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| So now if you think this is addressed to the mix of funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2511)|
| 0:41:53| not just hedging a specific category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| Oh, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2516)|
| 0:41:57| It is a mix of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| This plays to the idea that with diversity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| some classes are always going to gain in one year and others might go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| But on balance, you're trying to get a positive result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| Well, what we're trying to do is when we get to the point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| we're trying to develop kind of, I don't know if you're familiar with glide path theory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2534)|
| 0:42:21| where you get to a certain point and you reduce the risk because you're not needing to meet that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2541)|
| 0:42:28| Once you're 100% funded, you try to reduce your risk so you can maintain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| while still gaining in good years and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| We're trying to get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| So when we get a little closer, we're like, okay, let's take a little bit of risk off the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| put some things in cash, like with risk parity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| and let the manager do his job and figure out how he can emulate the volatility of the risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2566)|
| 0:42:55| but reduce the risk diverse portfolio but reduce the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2575)|
| 0:43:05| So you're saying sort of like leaving aggressive and going to moderate risk management or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2585)|
| 0:43:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2590)|
| 0:43:11| Jim, you got a handle that's more layman-y than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2591)|
| 0:43:22| I'm not sure we can make risk parity layman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| The normal, you know, if we talk about this, a lot of people talk about a 60-40 split| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2608)|
| 0:43:35| where you would have 60% of your investments in stocks and 40% in bonds and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| And that's kind of a, you know, generally accepted kind of threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| In that portfolio, what happens is that stocks are inherently, you know, more risky than bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2628)|
| 0:43:58| Or volatile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2638)|
| 0:43:59| Bonds have a risk as well, but stocks are more volatile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2639)|
| 0:44:06| What a risk parity strategy does is that it attempts to mirror the returns on a 60-40 portfolio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2646)|
| 0:44:14| but reduce that level of volatility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| And it does that through a variety of schemes to try and up the bond portion of the portfolio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2658)|
| 0:44:28| It may have some other things in it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2668)|
| 0:44:30| But, again, mirror that 60-40 split while reducing the volatility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2670)|
| 0:44:35| And what, as a plan, we're trying to do is, again, to achieve the seven and three-eighths return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2675)|
| 0:44:42| because that's the major driver in the cost of the plan as well as cost to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2682)|
| 0:44:50| And to do that, we are trying to, again, reduce volatility, lower risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2690)|
| 0:44:56| and still capture that sense of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| And to do that, we are trying to add some different kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2699)|
| 0:45:05| And risk parity is just one of those strategies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| International debt, both denominated in dollars or denominated in foreign currency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2708)|
| 0:45:15| is another attempt that we're doing to try and, again, achieve that seven and three-eighths return| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| while lowering the volatility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| And, again, that's what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| Actually adding an option or easing a restriction on the fund manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2727)|
| 0:45:32| Well, again, it's really not the fund manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| because the fund manager has certain guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| and certain things that they're going to have to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2738)|
| 0:45:42| What we're trying to do is say that we, before, we may not have been able to invest in risk parity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2742)|
| 0:45:48| Now, again, we think we could have because of the definitional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| but we're just trying to clarify it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| So what we're saying is that this clarifies it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| It says that risk parity is an acceptable investment vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| That international bond debt, again, is an acceptable investment vehicle as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2763)|
| 0:46:11| Again, the whole purpose is to lower the volatility of the fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2771)|
| 0:46:15| while achieving that seven and three-eighths return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2778)|
| 0:46:26| Does anybody have any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2786)|
| 0:46:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| Well, council, as always, if you have questions between now and when we come to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2795)|
| 0:46:41| council agenda, please don't hesitate to contact any of us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| And I'm glad to sit down with you individually if you wish to go to review any of these as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2805)|
| 0:46:53| Nobody, no one here from the public, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2813)|
| 0:46:56| I was just curious what Chief Sharp did wrong that he had to sit through this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2816)|
| 0:47:04| Now he's representing his employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| Well, rather than let it wait until February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2829)|
| 0:47:13| I still think it would be nice if someone would investigate a vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2833)|
| 0:47:19| or approach where the individual employee could somehow take his nest egg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| and provide for that disabled dependent without leaving the system at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| That's the part that troubles me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| And maybe it's in the form of counseling or assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| or getting him to a financial consultant, or maybe it's some other approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| whether it's through the lump sum or something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| But it seems to me that that person, the parent or call them the relative that's got the earnings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2865)|
| 0:47:52| needs to take some responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| Maybe they need help doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| I don't think the taxpayer should be the help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2876)|
| 0:47:58| So if there's another option that we could play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| I would love to have you explore that and bring it back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| But that's the thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| I don't know what that is exactly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| but obviously people who are financial planners or in that line of work would know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2887)|
| 0:48:13| And that would accomplish the goal of easing the employee's mind of what happens if I'm gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2893)|
| 0:48:19| and little Johnny or someone is in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| But it also eases the taxpayer's mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2902)|
| 0:48:24| So if there is some other vehicle, we should look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2904)|
| 0:48:29| I think that would be the advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2909)|
| 0:48:30| We will do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2910)|
| 0:48:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2911)|
| 0:48:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| Thanks, everybody, for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| We'll stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877150115?start=2915)|
