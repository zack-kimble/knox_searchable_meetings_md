| 0:01:08| Ms. Wilson, if you'll call the roll please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=68)|

| 0:01:26| Councilman Wallace. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=86)|
| 0:01:29| Okay, thank you. First up, I would like to recognize Myntha Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=89)|
| 0:01:34| I think she wants to give a brief presentation. I know you've got another pressing appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=94)|
| 0:01:43| I think Councilman Grieve had asked for her to come present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=103)|
| 0:01:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=110)|
| 0:01:52| I would like to clarify, I don't want to do this. I'm here because I was invited to do this, so I'm glad to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| Thank you for accepting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| That's the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=120)|
| 0:02:03| I'm glad to be here. I think Councilman Grieve asked me to come to share with you what KUB has done in our process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=123)|
| 0:02:11| to revise our benefit structure, including our pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=131)|
| 0:02:15| I have a handout that I think would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=135)|
| 0:02:19| Brenda, did you pass it out yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=141)|
| 0:02:23| Before I get to that, let me just say that I'm not a pension expert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=143)|
| 0:02:29| I'm not here to give anyone any advice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=149)|
| 0:02:32| And most importantly, I'm not here to say that what worked for KUB will work for anyone else, and in particular the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=152)|
| 0:02:39| I worked here for 19 years, and I have a great deal of respect for the hard work of the men and women of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=159)|
| 0:02:45| And the cultures of the city at KUB and KUB are very different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=165)|
| 0:02:51| The work is very different, and the needs of the personnel are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=171)|
| 0:02:56| This plan that we have works for us, considering what we were facing in our industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=176)|
| 0:03:02| and it may or may not work for anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| So I don't want anybody here to think that I am recommending that what we have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=184)|
| 0:03:09| and what I think is in our best interest would be, in fact, what you should do for your organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=189)|
| 0:03:17| And let me also say that we did not pursue changes to our benefit structure, to our pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=197)|
| 0:03:26| to any of our labor issues independently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=206)|
| 0:03:31| We looked at it as a whole package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=211)|
| 0:03:33| And the reason I have given you the handout that I've given you is because it helps explain the whole package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=213)|
| 0:03:40| And let me refer you to the handout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=220)|
| 0:03:43| On the back side, you will just see fast facts about KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=223)|
| 0:03:47| This is a form that we use a lot when we're in the public arena speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=227)|
| 0:03:51| We will not address that tonight, but that's there just for your information about the scope of the work we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| And it will remind you how different our organizations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=236)|
| 0:04:00| What I want to talk from is that which is on the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=240)|
| 0:04:04| In 1992, I left the city and went to KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| And one of the things that we were facing at that time was deregulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=250)|
| 0:04:14| The deregulation of the gas industry occurred in 1993.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| We anticipated deregulation of the electric industry later in the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=258)|
| 0:04:22| So it was imperative for us to become lean and mean and be able to compete in an open market for customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=262)|
| 0:04:28| So part of our early period of the 1990s was, what do we need to do to be able to compete and be successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=268)|
| 0:04:37| What that meant was that we needed to be able to have a labor force to meet our needs going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=277)|
| 0:04:43| As most of you who have been around a while remember, there was a charter change in 1998| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=283)|
| 0:04:50| that separated the pension and the merit system of the city and KUB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=290)|
| 0:04:55| and enabled KUB to design a system that worked for our changing needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| One of the things that we felt is that we needed, frankly, to have more turnover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=301)|
| 0:05:06| to enable employees who wanted to leave and not go through this changing environment to do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=306)|
| 0:05:13| and not take financial penalty for doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=313)|
| 0:05:16| And furthermore, we needed to be able to recruit mid-career hires in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=316)|
| 0:05:21| and they get the value for their tenure with KUB when they leave through their retirement benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=321)|
| 0:05:28| That is very difficult to do in a defined benefit plan unless you intend to stay your full career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=328)|
| 0:05:35| So that's kind of what we were facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=335)|
| 0:05:38| The other thing that we were facing is the need to consolidate and reduce employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=338)|
| 0:05:43| We needed to have a smaller headcount, very frankly, fewer employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| and the only way to do that and still do the same amount of work, in fact do more work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=348)|
| 0:05:53| was to consolidate some of our divisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=353)|
| 0:05:56| So we combined all of our engineering divisions together, all our meters departments together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| and in the old days we say we had the cats and dogs working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=361)|
| 0:06:05| In order to do that, we had to have a board-wide classification plan and pay plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=365)|
| 0:06:10| and all these things had to be created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=370)|
| 0:06:13| And I don't want to belabor this too much, but I want you to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| this wasn't started as a pension design or a cost saving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| It was designed initially to enable us to work more efficiently and productively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=380)|
| 0:06:26| with deregulation in the forefront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| So the first thing that we did after we got all the designing done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=390)|
| 0:06:34| was we offered a retirement incentive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| and that enabled some of our older tenured employees who did not want to go through the transition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| to leave with an incentive to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| And that was all voluntary, completely voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=406)|
| 0:06:49| Then we created a new pension design that was a hybrid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=409)|
| 0:06:53| That was implemented in 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| You'll see that on your chart there under the second bullet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=415)|
| 0:07:00| And let me make one thing perfectly clear about that new hybrid pension design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| I've heard there's a lot of debate here about whether pension benefits are Blackwellized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=426)|
| 0:07:12| that are covered by the Blackwell decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| and in our opinion our employees were covered by that decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=434)|
| 0:07:18| and all of our employees, including those that were non-vested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| we felt should have the privilege of choosing to go to a new plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| that we could not diminish or impair their benefits because of the Blackwell decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| So that was the initial approach that we took to pension design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| We came up with a hybrid that had a piece of defined benefit and a piece of 401K,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=457)|
| 0:07:44| and we operated under that pretty effectively until January of 2011, last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=464)|
| 0:07:53| We completely eliminated the hybrid plan last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=473)|
| 0:07:57| and now our new employees coming in have only a 401K defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=477)|
| 0:08:03| There are 17 employees who have been hired since that time who have that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=483)|
| 0:08:09| In addition to these changes that we made, we also eliminated the retiring medical plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=489)|
| 0:08:14| KUV employees enjoyed retiring medical benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=494)|
| 0:08:18| That was eliminated in 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=498)|
| 0:08:20| Over half of our employees now do not have that as a retirement benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| We restructured our leave program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| We did have sick leave and vacation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| We eliminated the dual plan and created paid time off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| so employees have an allocation of paid time off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| They use it for sick or vacation or whatever they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=516)|
| 0:08:39| and not a lot of questions are asked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| were you sick today and bring us a leave slip and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| We wanted to let employees have more flexibility in how they manage their time away from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=525)|
| 0:08:53| But I will say the most significant thing that we did to save money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| because I do believe that's one of the genesis around your discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=538)|
| 0:09:03| was simply reducing the head count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| We're not, we didn't save lots of cash by these redesigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=546)|
| 0:09:13| You will in years later, but it takes a long time to save the cash of these new designs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=553)|
| 0:09:22| And you'll see at the very bottom box, in 2009, we had a recession response plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=562)|
| 0:09:28| We reduced our head count again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| In January of this year, we achieved our goal of reaching 875.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| Through the reductions in the head count and medical plan changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=576)|
| 0:09:40| moving the retirees who do have medical to Medicare Plan D,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| and closing the pension plan, we will be able to save $240 million over the next 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| But as you can see, the smallest amount of that is the pension savings of $7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=590)|
| 0:09:56| moving to the defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=596)|
| 0:09:59| So the driver for us was more to have flexibility with our workforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=599)|
| 0:10:04| coming in and going out, moving them within our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| It wasn't solely driven by cost savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=609)|
| 0:10:12| Cost savings were very, very important to us, and we have achieved that, as you can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=612)|
| 0:10:17| But we did it more so through reducing our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=617)|
| 0:10:21| When I went to work at KUB, we had 1,250 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| Today we have 875.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| On the right in the box, you'll see the current design for the 401K plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| It's pretty simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| You get a contribution to your pension plan, and it's matched by KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=634)|
| 0:10:40| and then you can also contribute more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| KUB will do a contribution whether you contribute or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| but if you contribute more, we'll match the contribution you do more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=647)|
| 0:10:50| We vest fully at six years, but there's a progressive vesting from zero up to six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| with 20, 40, 60, 80, 100% vesting as hurdles up to those levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=656)|
| 0:11:03| In the box right below that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=663)|
| 0:11:05| you will see what our contributions to our pension trust fund are for the next six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| That's all the remarks I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=671)|
| 0:11:13| I hope it kind of didn't confuse you a lot, but put it all in perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=673)|
| 0:11:18| I think it's important to know that at KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=678)|
| 0:11:23| that if we were going to make the transition and be leaner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| and be ready for competition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=687)|
| 0:11:30| then we needed to have a workforce that was able to deliver our services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=690)|
| 0:11:36| We cannot do what we do without our workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| We cannot do that without paying our workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| We cannot do that without providing for the financial security of our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=702)|
| 0:11:47| through pension, health care plan, paid time off, those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| So it was a strategy to ensure that the employees we had left, the 875,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=711)|
| 0:11:58| were well compensated and well benefited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=718)|
| 0:12:01| and our cost savings mainly came from reducing the head count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| Well, let me say, I mean, we're on a fact-finding mission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=725)|
| 0:12:09| and we talked about on the front end, I think Councilman Della Vopi did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| just about large businesses or people that have been through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=733)|
| 0:12:17| and that's the reason, you know, we're just trying to gather as much information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=737)|
| 0:12:21| to make the best decision that we can as a council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| So we appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| Well, I admire you for doing it because it's not easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| As I said, I went to work there in 1992,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| and we started implementing these kinds of things in 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| So it takes a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=756)|
| 0:12:38| It did for us and our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Unfortunately, I don't think you have the luxury of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| but it is an appropriate thing to look at and to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| because it is your taxpayers' money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=767)|
| 0:12:49| but it's also your strongest resources are your employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=777)|
| 0:12:59| Councilman Graves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| I just want to thank you very much for coming and sharing with what KUB did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| We appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| Glad to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=789)|
| 0:13:10| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| Could you talk a little bit more about the retirement incentive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| At the time we did the retirement incentive, we were still under Plan A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=797)|
| 0:13:20| which is the same at the time that the city had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| I think the city's Plan A has even changed since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| Therefore, we didn't have the capability of adjusting the retirement benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| because we didn't control the pension plan and couldn't design it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| So what we did is we gave employees $500 for every year they worked in the form of a bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=816)|
| 0:13:42| Our goal was to reduce employment by 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| That would have been a good objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| We actually reduced it by a little over 10%, 118 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| and we paid back that bonus in six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=844)|
| 0:14:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| I have noticed that we have one special visitor here, Mayor Rojero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=849)|
| 0:14:13| You snuck in on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| I'm sorry I didn't recognize you earlier against the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| Mr. Frost, if you would, I mean, Roach kind of led us right into a great discussion on the Blackwell case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=860)|
| 0:14:29| And if you would, if you would just give a brief overview of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| Thank you, Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| Back in the 1980s, this is a case that emanated out of the western part of Tennessee, the Memphis area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=877)|
| 0:14:46| There was in Memphis there was some discussion and actual proposed changes to pension systems there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=886)|
| 0:14:54| And a suit was filed and it went through the various level of the court system, trial courts, courts of appeals, so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=894)|
| 0:15:04| It involved, among other things, altering the pensions of governmental employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| who were vested in the pension plan at the particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=911)|
| 0:15:19| Long story short, the court adopted what was called the Pennsylvania rule at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| And the gist of what the court said was an employee who has complied with all of the conditions to vest in the program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=925)|
| 0:15:35| could not have their pension benefits diminished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=935)|
| 0:15:42| Someone had to be vested to meet all the requirements, such as in some cases longevity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=942)|
| 0:15:49| that they had done all the proper steps to become a vested member of that pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=949)|
| 0:15:59| Pension plans can be closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=959)|
| 0:16:02| New pension plans can be opened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| But the Supreme Court determined that they were going to follow the Pennsylvania rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=964)|
| 0:16:11| And once someone had complied with all the conditions, they were therefore vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=971)|
| 0:16:17| Most recently, there's a 2005 Tennessee Attorney General's opinion that I've previously forwarded to all members of council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=977)|
| 0:16:27| that discusses Blackwell, discusses the Pennsylvania rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=987)|
| 0:16:33| I think the opinion still hasn't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| Blackwell has not been overruled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| And I would, you know, respectfully submit that that more than likely stands as good law today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=999)|
| 0:16:48| Thank you, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| I mean, I know that we've had robust dialogue here on this body about, you know, is it valid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1010)|
| 0:16:57| Is it not valid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1017)|
| 0:16:59| I don't know if it is or it isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| The courts say that it is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| But at the end of the day, without five votes from this council, it doesn't matter one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| And I think to settle this and to get this uneasy feeling and where we can progress forward, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1030)|
| 0:17:18| I'd like to suggest that we do a straw poll and just to see if that would be as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1038)|
| 0:17:28| or not we would want to move forward and see if we would even be willing to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1048)|
| 0:17:35| and see if it's valid or not valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1055)|
| 0:17:38| We need to see if there's support on this to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| Councilman Greene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| I understand what you're saying, but I'm questioning whether it's too early to do that from the standpoint of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1065)|
| 0:17:52| in case there are questions that come up about any of the options that we have that to immediately do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1072)|
| 0:17:59| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1079)|
| 0:18:00| It just seems like a little too soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| Plus, for instance, I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1082)|
| 0:18:03| When you talk about this, I assume that's the state supreme court that ruled on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| And then the other question I have is you're talking about vested employees only, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1088)|
| 0:18:16| In other words, if someone's in the plan but they're not vested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| they're, according to Blackwell, they've not complied with all of the conditions to become vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1099)|
| 0:18:26| So the Blackwell decision was only for vested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1106)|
| 0:18:28| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1108)|
| 0:18:29| I mean, it's, in my opinion, it's fairly clear about those people who have complied with all the conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1109)|
| 0:18:36| where they have become vested in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1116)|
| 0:18:39| I think it is up for consideration that if someone has not vested in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1119)|
| 0:18:49| but there has to be the willingness of people on council to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| Mr. Vice Chairman, I mean, I fully support those that are vested not to take away any of their benefits at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1135)|
| 0:19:04| I don't have a problem with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| but I just think that I'm not sure that we've clearly gone through everything to where we need to make a straw vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1145)|
| 0:19:11| I'm talking about for the vested employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1151)|
| 0:19:19| Any vote taken at a workshop is nothing more than an informal, non-binding straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1159)|
| 0:19:26| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| You know, I think we've heard from several folks about the idea of a vested benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1172)|
| 0:19:38| and certainly someone who's retired, I think that benefit should not be touched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| Retired?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| It's already retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| I think that's pretty clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| And even someone who's vested because they put in five years or seven years or whatever the rules apply to their particular plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1187)|
| 0:19:54| I mean, I think there's a good argument that if you can avoid it, you shouldn't touch those benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| That doesn't answer the question, though, of how does a body like this, a community like this, deal with the cost side of the ledger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1200)|
| 0:20:09| And I think that not only this council or the mayor's office, but every employee out here has an interest in keeping this plan healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1209)|
| 0:20:17| And we've got to be smart enough to learn what tools are at our disposal and how we make the cost side of the equation work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1217)|
| 0:20:26| Because if it doesn't work, everybody's hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| I mean, a plan that fails because it isn't actuarially sound doesn't benefit anybody, whether you use magic words like vested or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1228)|
| 0:20:37| And we've all read newspapers and stuff where cities are in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1237)|
| 0:20:41| So rather than get to the edge of the bridge, which turns out to be out and there's a 200-foot drop to the river and face it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1241)|
| 0:20:49| we're trying, I think, in advance to see what's a smart solution that works for everybody, both sides of the fence, everybody, the taxpayers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1249)|
| 0:20:56| the workers, the council, everybody in the room that's involved as a participant needs to find a way to make a retirement plan work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1256)|
| 0:21:06| so that we recruit and keep good employees, they have something to look forward to that supports them in their retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| but doesn't bankrupt the city and doesn't put such a strain on the budget where 20 or 25 percent of the budget gets diverted from doing good things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1272)|
| 0:21:23| to make this a better city into just trying to keep up with the flow of the shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1283)|
| 0:21:30| So I think benefits and cost sharing or solutions that deal with cost sharing are different sides of the ledger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1290)|
| 0:21:39| and we should keep an open mind to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1299)|
| 0:21:42| I don't care if we have a straw poll now or like Duane says, let's get some facts in front of us that help us understand what we've got to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1302)|
| 0:21:51| because I don't know that anybody in this room is ready to design a solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1311)|
| 0:21:55| We're trying to learn what the problem is, other than it's a money shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1315)|
| 0:22:00| But go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1320)|
| 0:22:01| That's my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1321)|
| 0:22:02| That's Duane's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1322)|
| 0:22:04| Well, I think you've really got two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| And what to decide to do about that and about discussing the Blackwell issue is an issue that we can set aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1326)|
| 0:22:13| and come back to it if we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1333)|
| 0:22:15| I think we're really time crunched to get this vetted out, talked about, planned out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1335)|
| 0:22:21| I mean, you've heard KUB say they took almost seven years to work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1341)|
| 0:22:25| And we've got a really tight time schedule to get a plan before the pension board to get it on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1345)|
| 0:22:33| I think we take the issue of the current plan and set it aside and come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| Well, I think we ought to spend our time talking about how to design a new plan and how we move forward and go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1359)|
| 0:22:47| Because they're really two separate issues, the way I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1367)|
| 0:22:49| They're not related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| And if we want to come back, maybe another municipality will test those waters before we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1370)|
| 0:22:56| But it's not an issue we have to decide today by June the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1376)|
| 0:22:59| But it is an issue to decide whether we're going to have a new plan and what that plan is going to look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1379)|
| 0:23:03| So, I mean, I don't know that we need to straw a poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1383)|
| 0:23:08| We don't have enough information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1388)|
| 0:23:09| But we really have a limited, very limited amount of time to come up with a new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| And if I could respond to those two, then I'll recognize Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1394)|
| 0:23:18| And that's my point, is, I mean, we have discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| You know, it's kind of dominated in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1402)|
| 0:23:27| And our council has opined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| The city law director has opined that they feel like it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| And do we want to keep miring ourselves in this discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| I'm like you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1421)|
| 0:23:42| I want to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| I want to find out what we can do and not what's out there lurking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| But at the end of the day, if there's five of us, you know, you've got to have five votes to do anything on this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1429)|
| 0:23:56| And it's a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| But I think it would be a strong show or a good forecast of what would come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1438)|
| 0:24:06| Well, I think if I were voting, I would say set it aside for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| I'm not voting that we never discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1450)|
| 0:24:12| Maybe it's got worthiness to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| It doesn't mean you're going to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| And it doesn't mean you're going to make dramatic changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| But let's just set that piece of this discussion aside and talk about it and spend our time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| Again, we're very, very limited on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| Well, we are limited on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| But the thing about it is, I mean, we discussed it last time as to whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1469)|
| 0:24:33| or not we wanted to hire an outside council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1473)|
| 0:24:38| And there was no really ñ there wasn't five members of council that wanted to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| So, I mean, we can sit here and discuss it all day long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| I'm not an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| I mean, we've got attorneys on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| The two people that we look to for our law guidance have opined that we can't touch it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| So, you know, that's my reason for wanting to move this along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| I think it's just with me it's a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1500)|
| 0:25:03| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1503)|
| 0:25:04| Did you phrase the question that you were asking us to straw poll about because I'm very concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1504)|
| 0:25:11| Those vested employees are ñ the Blackwell case would apply to their pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1511)|
| 0:25:21| It applies to their pensions anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| It applies to their pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| I'm saying ñ but what Nick is saying, and I'm not going to put words in your mouth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1523)|
| 0:25:29| but what I understood you to say is that there's room there to question that room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1529)|
| 0:25:39| This was a thought that was thrown out at the meeting to see what we could learn because we have to look at options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1539)|
| 0:25:46| The mayor came to us and said, look, let's start with the people we haven't even hired yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| And that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| There's a plan that's going to ñ and you heard KUB said they had a plan for new workers, and that's what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1553)|
| 0:25:58| That's a good thing, but that has almost zero budget impact in the short term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| and in this three or four or five-year span where we're going to rocket up that list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1562)|
| 0:26:07| and be $20 million in the hole or $25 million in the hole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| And what I was saying is, one, since nobody in this room is a pension lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1572)|
| 0:26:19| even Mr. Swanson, if he were here, is not a pension lawyer, do we hire one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| But put that aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1583)|
| 0:26:24| What I'm saying is the second side of the ledger of the cost of making the system actuarially sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1584)|
| 0:26:31| Let's assume that we can't change the plan at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1591)|
| 0:26:34| Let's assume we can't change the plan at all for people who are vested either because they're retired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1594)|
| 0:26:40| or because they put in five or seven years or whatever the plan they're in says to get vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| That leaves the 200 or 300 people that aren't vested that are current employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| and it leaves the question, I think more important question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| of how do we work with our employees who are all hardworking people who represent this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1613)|
| 0:26:59| how do we work with them to share the cost that's coming down the pike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| Because it's a big one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1623)|
| 0:27:04| I mean, you know, in a rational discussion, they might say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| I'd be happy to pay another percent or two into the pension plan if you're putting in $20 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1628)|
| 0:27:13| instead of eight or ten or $12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| That discussion should stay open because we've got to solve the money problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| This legislature decides where the money comes from, and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| it either comes from the taxpayer's hide or we start doing what KUB had to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| which was lean out the organization and get rid of people because they couldn't afford to carry the overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1648)|
| 0:27:33| But the overhead's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1653)|
| 0:27:35| And I think we've got to be smart, and I think we've got to work with our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| and partner with our employees and with the taxpayers that we represent to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| what's a good solution that works for everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| And I think everyone who has spoken, whether it's Mr. Swanson or whether it's Mr. Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1665)|
| 0:27:52| and whether it's the case has talked about pension benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1672)|
| 0:27:57| That's what you receive when you get to the end of the road and you're retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| Those cases all talk about, at least to me, and I'm not going to claim to be a pension lawyer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1682)|
| 0:28:07| but I am trained as a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| They talk to me about the legislature having the burden of making sure that these things are funded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1689)|
| 0:28:17| and that rules change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| And you heard both our actuary, and if you read the Blackwell case, they talked about the actuary there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1700)|
| 0:28:25| They make informed guesses of what the cost is going to be in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| And every couple of years they change their informed guess because they don't have a crystal ball either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1710)|
| 0:28:37| And it comes back to us as the legislature to say, how can we fund a pension system in a rational way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1717)|
| 0:28:46| Partly it's through our taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| Partly it's through cost savings and how we manage this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1728)|
| 0:28:51| And the administration is to be commended for wanting to do things that save costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| And partly it's going to be working with our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1735)|
| 0:28:57| Maybe there's some way to fund it better than we're doing right now in order to meet the obligations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1737)|
| 0:29:04| that we're claiming are vested and are coming down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| I mean, the scary thing to me is that that's not a little short blip and then we get over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| That's a 24-year trip at a higher level than we've paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| And I don't know if we can afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1755)|
| 0:29:17| And what are we going to do when that hits the fan, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| And we're smart to be looking now to avoid it hitting the fan, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| I think that's what we're doing here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| But I think the part that you said about that we claim is vested is what is concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1766)|
| 0:29:32| I don't know what claim is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1772)|
| 0:29:34| Well, okay, there's no magic in those words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1774)|
| 0:29:36| What I'm saying is I think this group is probably going to end up saying that vested benefits are clearly protected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1776)|
| 0:29:44| and we're not going to fool with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| I think that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1786)|
| 0:29:47| Now, we've got to start new plans and we've got to cross the bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1787)|
| 0:29:51| Is it only new hires or is it people that are not vested in the plan because they haven't put in the four, five, six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1791)|
| 0:29:59| seven years, whatever each plan says?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1799)|
| 0:30:01| In other words, those people can be affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1801)|
| 0:30:03| They don't have any rights in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| They're working towards it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| They hope to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| But you heard what KUV did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| They found a way to come up with incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1810)|
| 0:30:12| So we'll put incentives, for example, in a contribution plan where you get something good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1812)|
| 0:30:18| It's a portable plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1818)|
| 0:30:19| You can take it with you if you ever leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| But you're coming up with something that has as its goal cost containment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1821)|
| 0:30:28| I mean, the problem now is if the economy goes great for ten years, maybe some of this will work its way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1828)|
| 0:30:33| If it goes down another cliff, we're going to have not only this unfunded liability but a second one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| But we've got 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1839)|
| 0:30:40| We don't have 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| We can't vet all that out on the current plan in 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| The only thing we can do in the next 60 days is look at what we're going to do, new plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1844)|
| 0:30:49| and come back to that idea when you've got more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| We've got 25 years to work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1852)|
| 0:30:54| I mean, literally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| So I think that's if there's a poll vote, it's just to set that piece aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1855)|
| 0:31:00| It's not to vote it up or down whether we think we should or shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1860)|
| 0:31:03| It's just set it aside and talk about something new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| Well, and I'll agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1865)|
| 0:31:07| And I'll end this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| But, I mean, as you know, I think the discussion was going towards if employees were willing to negotiate, you know, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1868)|
| 0:31:21| But, you know, otherwise, it's solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1881)|
| 0:31:24| You know, that's my whole point is that that plan that they vested under is solid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1884)|
| 0:31:33| Vested employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| Vested employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1895)|
| 0:31:37| The ones that aren't vested, that's a different issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| But I hear what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1899)|
| 0:31:42| Mr. Wallace is saying let's deal with what we can deal with right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1902)|
| 0:31:45| because we don't have enough information or time to solve all the problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1905)|
| 0:31:48| Well, and that's kind of my point because, you know, there was a lot of time consumed at the last meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| about whether it was valid or not valid, where we're going to hire an outside attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| So I was wanting to bring it to a head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1918)|
| 0:32:00| So we can move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| I think the way I read, Rob, it was not just to hire an outside attorney or consultant to look at just the Blackwell case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1922)|
| 0:32:10| but to also guide us into, as you saw what they said, they hired attorneys and consultants to guide them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1930)|
| 0:32:17| I wasn't looking for and maybe I misread the question because I voted yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1937)|
| 0:32:22| I wasn't looking just for information on the Blackwell case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| I'm looking for information on how to craft and design a new plan that is sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1945)|
| 0:32:31| But, I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1951)|
| 0:32:34| But I still think you're going to need advice, yes, from an attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| and from consultants that do this for a living, not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| Mr. Vice Mayor, it's my understanding the vested employees are covered under the Blackwell decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| And we don't need to challenge, in my opinion, the Blackwell decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1972)|
| 0:32:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| Because that would just cost a whole lot of money, and we don't want to go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1979)|
| 0:33:07| I think the people would like to hear that, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| Well, I'm saying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=1990)|
| 0:33:21| Well, I think we've probably discussed that pretty well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| We'll move on to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| We're going to have presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| I think, Ms. Cash, thank you all for your consideration there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| I think it's a good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| This is not going to be easy, but we'll keep working at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2017)|
| 0:33:41| Ms. Cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2021)|
| 0:33:48| I wish you'd taken a straw poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| You could have relieved a lot of people's minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| Anita Cash, 160 Bird Road, Lenoir City, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| I work for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| I'm also the president of the General Government City Employees Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2038)|
| 0:34:04| And the very first thing I want to do is I want you all to look at all these people out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2044)|
| 0:34:09| They're in the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2049)|
| 0:34:11| They don't have a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2051)|
| 0:34:12| They have to participate in the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2052)|
| 0:34:14| Now, I want everybody that's been here more than five years to raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2054)|
| 0:34:21| All right, if you've been here between five and ten, put it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| If you've been here longer than ten, hold it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| Fifteen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Twenty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Twenty-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Thirty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| Thirty-five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| Forty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| We're not fly-by-nighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2077)|
| 0:34:38| We don't come and go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2078)|
| 0:34:40| We're here for a career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| And we're united on this front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2084)|
| 0:34:46| And it's well and good that you have Blackwell to protect currently vested employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| but you also have these other employees who were hired in here under a set of rules for a pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2091)|
| 0:34:58| that now you don't know whether you're going to change or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| And it's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| And Councilman Wallace, you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| We're about three years late and about millions of dollars short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| This process should have been started long, long, long time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| I've worked on every pension amendment that has been on the ballot except for one since 1996.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2116)|
| 0:35:24| We met for years to develop Plan G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| For years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| You're talking about a new plan that you want to impact people's lives with to come in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| and within 60 days develop a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| Well, I've got news for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| You're not going to do it in three workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| And if you think you are, you need to stop now and just go on and forget it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| And I hadn't intended to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| I've not even got to the first page yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2150)|
| 0:36:05| As of March 30, 2012, we had a total of 2,639 people that were either actively participating in a pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2165)|
| 0:36:16| or were receiving a benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| That's police and fire and general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| And I'm not going to talk about them and us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| It's us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| It's not an I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2184)|
| 0:36:25| It's a we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| So that's just the way it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| We have had since 1996 more than ten items on the ballots regarding pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2190)|
| 0:36:44| What I find most interesting is that, and you've heard a lot of talk about this, in 2000, we transferred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2204)|
| 0:36:53| or the voters voted to transfer Plan F to Plan C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| That was at a cost of $43 million to the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2218)|
| 0:37:05| On the ballot, and if you all have been to the poll and you voted, and I hope that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| and if not, shame on all of you, the chief financial officer of the city has to put the cost of that amendment on the ballot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2229)|
| 0:37:18| And I've got them over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2238)|
| 0:37:19| I went to the election commission and got them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| The annual net savings to the city of Knoxville to transfer that $43 million liability was $2,400,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2243)|
| 0:37:42| So I asked for the rainy day fund balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| And you all have heard and most of you all know it's somewhere around $65 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| And it just so happens that in the rainy day fund there is a $28 million surplus that isn't assigned to do anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2272)|
| 0:38:03| Now, $2,400,000 times 12 years comes out to $28.8 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2283)|
| 0:38:14| Is that an incidence?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2294)|
| 0:38:15| I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| In 2000, the city contribution to the pension plan was $2,736,496.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2300)|
| 0:38:31| It was the same thing in 2001 after the pension plan assumed a $43 million liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2311)|
| 0:38:39| What's even better than that is in 2002 the city of Knoxville contributed $999,896 to the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2319)|
| 0:38:51| $999,896.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2331)|
| 0:38:56| They just saved $2.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2336)|
| 0:39:01| So you're looking at these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| Some of them have their children with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| You're going to look at people that keep continuing to come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| Are there things that we think you could do to look and change to a pension plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2357)|
| 0:39:18| Number one, tenure vesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| Number two, increase the employee contribution to either 6.25 or 6.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2361)|
| 0:39:31| Number three, set a COLA at 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2371)|
| 0:39:37| I talked to Alan Pennington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| And, by the way, we owe him a big deal, a big thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| because he's talked to us at every opportunity he's been confronted with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2381)|
| 0:39:48| I said, Alan, in a 10-year period, tell me when the consumer price index isn't above 2 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2388)|
| 0:39:56| He said, one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| It averages anywhere from 2.5 to 2.75 every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| So we're already, if you vote that in for a new plan, you're already cutting the people .25 short most years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2403)|
| 0:40:10| and some years more even that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| We're not being unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| There's probably not a third of this room that this is even going to affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| We've got people here that even signed up on the drop plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| They're here because they're worried about their future city employees, their coworkers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2424)|
| 0:40:30| that they're probably never even going to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| We would like to see you leave in the rule of 80, 80 for the police and fire department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| 85 for general government employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| Reduce the retirement age in the proposed plan for police and fire back to 55, 60 for general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2441)|
| 0:40:51| We've got to start somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| And that's my recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2453)|
| 0:40:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2455)|
| 0:41:06| Give your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2466)|
| 0:41:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2467)|
| 0:41:10| Mark Taylor, 720 Hall of Fame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| I'm the Fraternal Order of Police Volunteer Lodge 2 president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2473)|
| 0:41:18| I appreciate your comments, Anita, and I appreciate the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| I've got just some general things that I want to talk to you about because what I feel is missing is the common man's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2482)|
| 0:41:30| the employee's perspective on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2490)|
| 0:41:35| And I'll go ahead and get it out of the way because I think one issue that we haven't talked about that Anita's touched on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| the funding, is an important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| Obviously, it's an important issue because the city's looking at having to put in $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| Now, before we ran pension, and everybody says, and this is the part that gets employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2509)|
| 0:41:54| We ran pension systems that we paid out of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2514)|
| 0:42:00| And then we designed a new pension system that was designed to provide over a long period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2520)|
| 0:42:07| so it could smooth out returns and investments and stuff, a good benefit to employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2527)|
| 0:42:13| Ninety-some percent of your law enforcement employees that retire stay here and live in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2533)|
| 0:42:20| They spend those retirement dollars right here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2540)|
| 0:42:26| That generates a lot of economic growth right here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2546)|
| 0:42:31| Every pension dollar that they spend here in Knoxville accounts for up to five, six dollars of new growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2551)|
| 0:42:39| These aren't my statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2559)|
| 0:42:40| This is national statistics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| You can pull it down online in about three seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2562)|
| 0:42:46| But the problem here is that somewhere around 2001, one of the problems, the other problem is the economy, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2566)|
| 0:42:54| But around 2001, we took $50 million worth of liability that we never planned for, that we didn't have a good system for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2574)|
| 0:43:06| and we dumped it on our pension system that was designed to operate and resolve these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2586)|
| 0:43:13| In effect, despite all of our conservative financial policies, which I applaud, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2593)|
| 0:43:19| because I don't want to work for a city that doesn't have those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| even if that means I don't get as much pay as the next officer over or whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2602)|
| 0:43:28| But we took, despite our conservative financial policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2608)|
| 0:43:33| and we financed $50 million worth of debt on an interest-only payment credit card called the pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2613)|
| 0:43:42| Before that, that wasn't even part of the pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| If you look at the contributions for ten years prior to that, that system worked perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2626)|
| 0:43:54| Very manageable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2634)|
| 0:43:56| And it provided a good competitive benefit to the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| Now, that's in jeopardy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| There's no easy way to pay off your credit card debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| Anyone who's had it knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| But you've got to bite the bullet and pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2648)|
| 0:44:10| You can't keep passing it along to some next credit card or some next group of employees and come out okay on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2650)|
| 0:44:18| That doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| You mentioned talking about non-vested employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| And I'll tell you, it's our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2664)|
| 0:44:28| When we come here, when I came here, I knew what my salary was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| It wasn't great, but I wanted to do this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| And I've grown to love this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| I'm committed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| But I knew what my benefits were, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2680)|
| 0:44:44| When they started taking that six percent out after three months for retirement, it was about in the fall in the academy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2684)|
| 0:44:52| And they also started, I became eligible for health care and dental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2692)|
| 0:44:56| And right after they took that out of my first check, I went and saw my training officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2696)|
| 0:45:00| and I asked for permission to work a second job at McDonald's in Dandridge after the police academy every night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2700)|
| 0:45:06| flipping burgers to 2 a.m., not so that I could put money in a 401K or invest anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| or put food on my kids' table for the rest of the time until I could get out in the streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2712)|
| 0:45:18| and start working some extra jobs and maybe make up for the hit that I took from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2718)|
| 0:45:23| These employees don't make a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| These officers that work here, the majority are never going to make a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| So even minor changes here should be thought about carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| and with a designed financial impact to make it sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2736)|
| 0:45:41| If we go too far off the board with these, you're going to create a whole class of police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2741)|
| 0:45:47| and city employees who you're going to be taking care of in retirement because either their health is failing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| they don't have enough money to pay for their medical insurance, they're going to be living here with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| They're not going to be able to afford to go anywhere else and retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2757)|
| 0:46:02| The other parts of this is we've talked a lot about risk and we've talked about commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2762)|
| 0:46:08| And I've talked to a lot of you and, you know, I've heard a lot of promise made is a promise kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| And I've heard a lot of discussion of Blackwell and this and whether it's vested employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| Blackwell clearly covers vested employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| It doesn't take a rocket science to figure that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| But there's another portion of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| You were talking about non-vested employees, and I think you mentioned two or three hundred, about three hundred non-vested employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2790)|
| 0:46:36| Okay, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| Well, I will tell you that a good portion of those two to three hundred non-vested employees that you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2798)|
| 0:46:44| are employees in my department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| They're young kids who come here on a faith and a promise and every day pin on a gun and a badge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2808)|
| 0:46:55| and go out there and patrol these streets in the middle of the night, take risks that other people won't take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2815)|
| 0:47:03| These jobs are not normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| The pay is not great, but the job they do is exceptional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| I challenge you to find another organization in the country of our size that provides a better service to its citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2828)|
| 0:47:18| than the Knoxville Police Department does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2838)|
| 0:47:20| You won't be able to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2840)|
| 0:47:22| I guarantee you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2842)|
| 0:47:23| Our pay is not the highest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| Our benefits aren't the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| But they're competitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| And we can keep those folks who have a desire to stay here and serve Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2850)|
| 0:47:35| You change that equation too much, don't fool yourself that you won't be affecting employee loyalty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2855)|
| 0:47:42| You put yourself in a position where you have a highly marketable employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2862)|
| 0:47:47| a top-rate employee that now federal agencies cherry pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| You reduce that benefit too much or get too severe with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2872)|
| 0:47:57| and you will have employees that the sheriff's department in Lowndon County has a better retirement benefit than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2877)|
| 0:48:05| that Chattanooga has a better benefit than, that Nashville has a better benefit than.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2885)|
| 0:48:11| Their pays are probably already higher in a lot of those instances I just cited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| Those employees now, instead of opening that up to federal agencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| and the people who are leaving because they're not cut out for police work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| you're now opening it up to a whole string of municipalities where you're going to be losing your talent to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2903)|
| 0:48:29| And I don't want to see a Knoxville where we don't have the quality of police officer that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2909)|
| 0:48:35| Because we've got something special here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| We have something special in this city, and it's taken a long time to get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2918)|
| 0:48:43| These decisions will have long impacts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| You've made another couple of points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| We've got to do something quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| And I understand the political urgency of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| But the reality is, as you've said, that has little financial impact for anybody now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2933)|
| 0:49:00| You're leaders of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| The discourse on this shouldn't be the city's going bankrupt or, you know, this or that or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2942)|
| 0:49:11| The discourse should be thoughtful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2951)|
| 0:49:13| It should be measured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| And it should be given the appropriate time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2955)|
| 0:49:18| Because the decision you make quickly now isn't going to have effects for you for another 10 to 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2958)|
| 0:49:27| You're going to have to pay that credit card debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| That's just how it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2970)|
| 0:49:32| The city isn't in that bad of shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| They're not going bankrupt tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| That's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| And the public shouldn't be hearing that from our leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2977)|
| 0:49:42| Our employees shouldn't be hearing that from our leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| Because we are, on your streets every day, the most visible form of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2986)|
| 0:49:53| Whether people realize that that's just a little $30,000 employee who's trying to make a minivan payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| and buy the next bottle of infant milk or not, they don't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| They see the government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3002)|
| 0:50:04| And we wear their discontent when people make statements like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3004)|
| 0:50:12| We're the ones that deal with that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| Society is a little different these days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3014)|
| 0:50:16| People now look for an excuse to go off, to be mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3016)|
| 0:50:24| We're the ones dealing with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| My guys deserve better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| I would respectfully, I talked to you about a year ago, and that's the one thing I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3030)|
| 0:50:35| If you remember when I spoke before council when this all first started, whatever you do, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3035)|
| 0:50:40| be careful how you do it because we deal with the results of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3040)|
| 0:50:45| And the impacts of that can be bad for us, and it can be bad for the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| So I respectfully ask that to tone down some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3050)|
| 0:50:59| We talked about non-vested employees a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3059)|
| 0:51:04| Those are contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3064)|
| 0:51:06| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3066)|
| 0:51:07| I mean, Pacwell doesn't say, you know, the specific question in a legal case answered vested employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3067)|
| 0:51:14| But if a guy's been here for four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| and he's not did anything to change the terms of the condition you hired him in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3077)|
| 0:51:21| and you go and change that, that's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3081)|
| 0:51:25| Forget legality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| That's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3087)|
| 0:51:28| Ask yourself the question you should be asking yourself is what type of community are we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3088)|
| 0:51:44| What do we stand for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| Are we a premier place to work, live, and raise a family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| Do we exemplify that in the ways that we treat our very own employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3112)|
| 0:51:58| Those are the sort of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3118)|
| 0:51:59| And that other question, when you look at it for a second and you think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| that other question doesn't even become a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| It's not even a consideration under those circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| The current plans that have been put forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3134)|
| 0:52:19| I applaud the mayor for trying to get out front of this and come up with some plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3139)|
| 0:52:26| because we've heard a lot of talk and we've heard a lot of negative comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| and we've heard a lot of supposition and we've heard a lot of ranting from a county mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| who in 15 minutes can unravel the world and make everything straight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3154)|
| 0:52:39| Haven't heard any details from the feller yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| Waiting for those greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3162)|
| 0:52:43| I've been at all those meetings and haven't seen him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| This stuff's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| I applaud the mayor for showing leadership and getting out front of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3169)|
| 0:52:54| With that being said, I think we're moving a little too fast| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| because we're rushing into something that we're not even going to see gains from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| That's not solving any problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| That might appease some citizen who doesn't understand the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3187)|
| 0:53:11| but you're the leadership of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3191)|
| 0:53:13| Tell your constituents, we're working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3193)|
| 0:53:16| We're going to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| We're going to look at it and we're going to do the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3197)|
| 0:53:21| But breaking a rush decision now doesn't fix anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3201)|
| 0:53:24| It could actually break it worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| There's some stuff out there on that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| The plans all said, get rid of the drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3210)|
| 0:53:35| That I have heard, I haven't heard any concrete financial impact to that drop plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3215)|
| 0:53:41| But I can tell you one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3221)|
| 0:53:43| At the end of 25 years of doing this job, you aren't fit for much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3223)|
| 0:53:51| You've likely got a couple of joints sewn back together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| You've probably got a couple of chronic diseases from the cumulative stress, the long shifts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3234)|
| 0:54:00| and whatever other injuries you occur around the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| The drop doesn't encourage early retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| At the end of 25 years of wearing a gun and a badge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| and the guys that I see leaving, they're leaving regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| The drop may keep a couple of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| And that's valuable to a leader of the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| because then he can plan how he's going to replace that 25 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| or that 30 years of expert experience and that work that that guy's doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3270)|
| 0:54:37| Because by that point in time, he's probably doing something that's pretty specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| and has a good impact on a certain area of crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| So that's an important tool that you should consider strongly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3287)|
| 0:54:52| We shouldn't just be making changes to these plans just for the sake of making changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3292)|
| 0:54:57| We should know to the dollar what each change we make is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3297)|
| 0:55:02| and what got us to the point to where we owed those dollars in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3302)|
| 0:55:07| That's just a basic problem-solving model, and that hasn't yet occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3307)|
| 0:55:15| The age of 57, that's too old to be a cop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3315)|
| 0:55:19| If you told me today that I had a state of 57, I'd probably run out of here right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3319)|
| 0:55:28| When someone, when some 18- or 20-year-old thug breaks into your house to rob you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3328)|
| 0:55:36| or to pillage or do whatever else, and this stuff occurs, it occurs all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3336)|
| 0:55:42| And I'm glad maybe our citizens don't realize that it occurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| but I can tell you everyone that wears a uniform here knows it occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| Do you want that 57-year-old cop busting in there if he can get the door kicked in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3350)|
| 0:55:55| and have a heart attack while you're watching you get murdered or killed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3355)|
| 0:56:02| Use some common sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3362)|
| 0:56:05| This is a contact sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3365)|
| 0:56:07| Are there people that can do it past 50 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3367)|
| 0:56:10| Sure. Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| Are they probably out there doing the base things that a police officer does for the majority of this department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3372)|
| 0:56:18| Absolutely not. Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| What you would do if you raise that too high is you would create a whole swarm of police officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3382)|
| 0:56:30| from successive classes that are in that upper age range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| They're going to be out there on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| You're going to have them dying on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3396)|
| 0:56:39| You're going to have people who can't perform the basic duties that you owe society of protecting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3399)|
| 0:56:50| That's a dangerous situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| That needs to be thought about carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| These jobs are different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| You know, a police officer comes here and he gives you all the good years of his life for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3417)|
| 0:57:05| I've got my two sons in the audience here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3425)|
| 0:57:08| I'll call them for a second my expert witnesses on the effects of being a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| They'll tell you for the first 10 to 12 years of their life, other than being able to identify me from recognition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| when I came in grumpy in the morning between a double or triple shift, they really didn't even know me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3440)|
| 0:57:27| They didn't get to go to any UT football games with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| They didn't get to go to Boomsday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| The next time you walk down to your football game with your family, look and see who's standing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| It isn't the UT Police Department on those sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| It isn't UT professors directing traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3462)|
| 0:57:45| It isn't lawyers downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3465)|
| 0:57:47| It isn't none of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| It's some underpaid cop who's got a wife and a kid back at home who's mad at him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3468)|
| 0:57:53| because his boss told him he had to work on his day off for 25 years to 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3473)|
| 0:58:01| That's what you expect in this line of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3481)|
| 0:58:03| These jobs aren't the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3483)|
| 0:58:05| You can't compare them to those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| You can, but it's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3487)|
| 0:58:09| It's not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3489)|
| 0:58:11| It's not what we should stand for as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3491)|
| 0:58:21| I think that's going to end my comments on this for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3501)|
| 0:58:27| I'd be happy if any of you have any questions about what I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3507)|
| 0:58:33| or what police officers think about any of the proposed changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| or what we think is a workable solution for any of these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| My number is 865-773-2986.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3522)|
| 0:58:48| I drink a lot of coffee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| Give me a call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3529)|
| 0:59:00| Thank you, Mr. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3540)|
| 0:59:01| Thank you, Mr. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| And there may be questions, you know, after we finish the other presentations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3542)|
| 0:59:11| Kevin Faddis, 614 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| I'm the firefighter association president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| Dagon, if I needed it, and steal some of my numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| So I might be rambling a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3561)|
| 0:59:23| Number one, I want everybody in here, taxpayer, employee, you know, whoever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| family member, to realize that we do give to our pension 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| We understand the city pays some, too, but we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3575)|
| 0:59:39| We do give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3579)|
| 0:59:41| Councilman Wallace, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| We got 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| Is that what it is, 60 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| Ms. Mintha Roach got up here, and to be honest with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3589)|
| 0:59:53| I need to apologize to her because I had her all wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3593)|
| 0:59:58| It took seven years to get theirs figured out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3598)|
| 1:00:01| Here we are, knee-jerk reaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| I understand there's something going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| I understand there could be a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3605)|
| 1:00:07| Actuaries, I've asked Mr. Cherry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| I've asked Mr. Pennington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| Some of these people probably know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| How often are they right, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| How often are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3619)|
| 1:00:23| I don't know that the taxpayers or even some of the people on council are aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3623)|
| 1:00:29| Last year, our pension fund got 25.1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3629)|
| 1:00:35| Now, we probably had to pay a couple percentage points out of that to the retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3635)|
| 1:00:41| You know, the thing I'm looking at here, since 1996, we've had three bad years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3641)|
| 1:00:47| But we're not the only ones who had three bad years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| Everybody had three bad years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3651)|
| 1:00:54| Not just us, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3654)|
| 1:00:57| Are they trying to dig out of a hole?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| You know, TVA, KUB, I'm not saying this is what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| Sometimes they have a rate hike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| I'm not saying it goes to their pensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| But, you know, we don't have that luxury, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| Are we going too fast on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3673)|
| 1:01:15| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3675)|
| 1:01:16| Is it going to affect a lot of people, a lot of retention, a lot of recruitment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3676)|
| 1:01:20| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| I mean, at the Roach, like I said, they went from 1,250 to 875.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| Can we even do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| Well, I can tell you we can't downgrade our workforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3689)|
| 1:01:32| Heck, the fire department, since 1974, we're down 150 men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3692)|
| 1:01:38| The tax base has grown and so has the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| EMS, car wrecks, getting people out of the floor, helping with the elderly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3701)|
| 1:01:49| the handicap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| Our run volume has grown exponentially, 26,000 EMS calls last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3710)|
| 1:01:57| So we're getting it, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| I won't even go into Blackwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3722)|
| 1:02:04| I'll just let that die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3724)|
| 1:02:10| Thank you, Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3730)|
| 1:02:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| You know, it's trends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3736)|
| 1:02:21| Everybody knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3741)|
| 1:02:22| I mean, even the actuaries, up and down, up and down, up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| But another important thing is does anybody know how much the city actually contributed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3746)|
| 1:02:33| based on an actuary or what they actually gave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3753)|
| 1:02:38| The numbers are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| I've seen them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3759)|
| 1:02:41| Some years they might have given a little more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| but, boy, there's a lot of years that they didn't give enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| So it's not you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| It's people in the past that have sat up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| Like Anita said, we should have dealt with this a couple years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3774)|
| 1:03:00| But that would have been a political, suicidal move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3780)|
| 1:03:04| We all know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| So here we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| We've got 60 days to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| But I will tell you, we're willing to work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| We really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| I mean, my guys, we understand the constraints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| We're willing to work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3795)|
| 1:03:17| And hopefully we'll get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| Like I said, Anita stole some of my thunder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3802)|
| 1:03:24| But we've got one more meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| Maybe I can get something, pull something out of my pocket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| But thank you, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3810)|
| 1:03:39| Mr. Faddis and for the group, I mean, we've got three scheduled workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3819)|
| 1:03:43| I mean, we had to put something on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| I mean, it doesn't mean that we're going to make that we're bound to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| I just want everybody to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| I mean, it's the only time that these issues can be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3831)|
| 1:03:54| is when there's going to be a state election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3834)|
| 1:03:56| And I guess that's what we're up against, just to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3836)|
| 1:04:02| Yes, sir, your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| My name is Bill Warwick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| I'm a retired firefighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| I reside at 1401 Bonita Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| I'm 73 years old and have lived in this city 73 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| I've owned a home in this city since 1962.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| I retired after 35 years of service with the Knoxville Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3861)|
| 1:04:25| And those were 35 years of great employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3865)|
| 1:04:30| I enjoyed every moment of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| It was a great time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3872)|
| 1:04:33| It was a great ride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3873)|
| 1:04:34| I felt like it was a privilege to be in the service of the Fire Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3874)|
| 1:04:38| and serve this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3878)|
| 1:04:40| When I came to work April 1, 1967,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| I came to work at the wonderful pay scale of $375 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3884)|
| 1:04:50| And after the first three months were up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| we began to pay pension contributions and health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| And as the police officers were referring to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| part-time jobs were a part of our livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| We had to have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3902)|
| 1:05:04| But that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| That didn't bother us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| We went ahead and did our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| We came to work every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| We did our job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3909)|
| 1:05:10| We filled our job descriptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3910)|
| 1:05:12| We met our requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3912)|
| 1:05:14| When our paycheck came, our pension deductions were withheld| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| and our health care insurance premiums were withheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| We did that on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| Now, on some occurrences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3925)|
| 1:05:27| the former city fathers failed to meet some of their obligations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| in pension contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3931)|
| 1:05:33| which has compounded the felony that we are looking at now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3933)|
| 1:05:38| So the problem does exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3938)|
| 1:05:40| There's going to have to be some things looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3940)|
| 1:05:43| But there's some things I would encourage you to take under advisement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| And this is coming from an old fool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| so it's going to be worth what you paid for it, and that's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3948)|
| 1:05:52| But you're going to get it anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3952)|
| 1:05:55| Now, behind me are a group of wonderful employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| I know some of them, and most of them I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| Most of them are younger than I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3963)|
| 1:06:04| I could be the father to most of them in age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| But these people are career employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3967)|
| 1:06:10| They come to work for this city for the same reasons I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| a fair pay scale and a good pension and benefit package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3974)|
| 1:06:20| That is part of the attraction that brings people to work for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3980)|
| 1:06:24| And that's what brought me to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| In fact, when I left the job that I was employed in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| coming to the city of Knoxville Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3991)|
| 1:06:34| it required a pay reduction for me to take that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3994)|
| 1:06:37| But the benefit package was the attraction that brought us in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| So we need to keep those things in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| and make sure that we don't do some things that are without cause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4003)|
| 1:06:49| Now, the drop plan has been addressed on a couple of statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4009)|
| 1:06:53| And I'll stand here and tell you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4013)|
| 1:06:55| I'm the person that brought the drop plan to the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| I found it in Shreveport, Louisiana, at a firefighter convention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4019)|
| 1:07:04| Brought it back here and started talking about it, and we called it the Louisiana plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4024)|
| 1:07:09| It was 12 years before we were able to adopt that drop plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4029)|
| 1:07:15| after it was introduced to our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| And this is a benefit that has no cause to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4038)|
| 1:07:21| And I'll be glad to sit down with anyone who would like to talk about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| and share that information with you as to how it actually works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| what causes it to happen, and what brings it into fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4048)|
| 1:07:32| So we need to keep all these benefits as close intact as we possibly can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| I understand very well what the Blackwell program is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| I was introduced to it many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4062)|
| 1:07:45| And the provisions are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| There's no need to wash that horse again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| We need to make sure that we take care of these current employees who are not vested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4069)|
| 1:07:54| and those are to be hired later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4074)|
| 1:07:57| Let us do not perform an abortion on these people and throw them to the wolves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4077)|
| 1:08:02| These are people that are here that have been made a promise to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4082)|
| 1:08:06| So I would encourage you as members of council to sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4086)|
| 1:08:10| and work with our employee representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| and work out some concessions that are amenable on both sides of defense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| and keep these programs intact as much as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| Now, I did a little research on some of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| Even though I'm retired, I'm affected by what goes on because I have family that work in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4104)|
| 1:08:30| And so the effects are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4110)|
| 1:08:33| And I went online and did some research for the defined benefit programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| which actually was instituted by the U.S. government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4117)|
| 1:08:40| They were the fathers of the defined benefit program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4120)|
| 1:08:44| So it's not anything new that came along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4124)|
| 1:08:46| They actually implemented this back about 1929.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4126)|
| 1:08:50| And we still have a federal defined benefit program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| and I'm sure all of you are a participant in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4134)|
| 1:08:56| It's called the Social Security Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| So we all are involved in a defined benefit program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| So as we move this thing along, don't be hasty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| Time is not our enemy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| As it took us 12 years to adopt an already in place program called the drop plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4150)|
| 1:09:16| and get it in place and the years it took to develop these other programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| and as Ms. Roach spoke about the time it took for them to move into their changes, time is not our enemy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4161)|
| 1:09:27| No matter what is done today and goes on the ballot this November,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4167)|
| 1:09:31| we're not having an effect on the cost effectiveness of where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| Make sure we're doing the right things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4175)|
| 1:09:37| Make sure we get all the T's crossed, the I's dotted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| and keep everyone in place and make sure that we protect the unborn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4180)|
| 1:09:45| That's the employee not hired yet and those that are not vested in our program at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4185)|
| 1:09:50| Thank you all for all you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4190)|
| 1:09:52| You all work hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4192)|
| 1:09:53| You give us your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4193)|
| 1:09:54| We appreciate what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4194)|
| 1:09:55| We are willing to work with you to help share what knowledge we have to make these things work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4195)|
| 1:10:02| And we would be glad to meet with you anywhere, anytime and discuss these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4202)|
| 1:10:07| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4207)|
| 1:10:16| Do we have any other folks that signed up to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4216)|
| 1:10:32| Gordon Catlett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4232)|
| 1:10:43| Captain Gordon Catlett, 7424 Pellow Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4243)|
| 1:10:48| The reason that I've asked to speak to council tonight is in regard to the pension task force that I personally served on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| along with Anita Cash and other members of the community that was the council's actual task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| And there's a few issues or a few points that I want to bring up to council to make sure that the work that this task force went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4259)|
| 1:11:08| is reminded and we cover some of the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| But before I do, I want to say, since it is my time, I've got the mic now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| I want to thank Mayor O'Hara because it takes courage to be the first one to send out proposals to a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4280)|
| 1:11:28| It takes courage to take a leadership stance and to step out and say we shouldn't impact any current employees that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4288)|
| 1:11:37| We shouldn't draw that line of division between the vested employees and the employees that are not vested under the current plan at City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4297)|
| 1:11:46| So thank you, Mayor, for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4306)|
| 1:11:52| With that being said, I'd like to mention a few things that were contained in the pension task force report that council was afforded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4312)|
| 1:12:00| To begin with, the market value of assets of the City of Knoxville pension system was $468.4 million as of July 11, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4320)|
| 1:12:08| That represented a $62.3 million gain in one year since July 1, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4328)|
| 1:12:16| A $63 million gain in one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4336)|
| 1:12:18| That's not my numbers, folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| That's from the actuary report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4340)|
| 1:12:22| That's from the letter that council received in July of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4342)|
| 1:12:27| So this is another thing that was included or another fact that was included in the pension task force report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4347)|
| 1:12:34| Furthermore, pension task force conclusions and recommendations, I have noticed that several times in the media,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4354)|
| 1:12:42| what's being released is a portion of the statement that the pension task force made is being reused over and over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4362)|
| 1:12:51| but the entire sentence is not being captured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4371)|
| 1:12:55| So I'd like to review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4375)|
| 1:12:57| The pension task force actually said, and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| it is the conclusion of the pension task force that the Knoxville pension system is not sustainable under the current actuarial assessment rate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4380)|
| 1:13:11| of an annual return of $3.75 and the City of Knoxville current annual contribution of $13.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4391)|
| 1:13:20| And, actually, that should be $7.375 annual rate of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| That's actually what the pension task force said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4406)|
| 1:13:29| The pension task force didn't say that the system is doomed no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4409)|
| 1:13:37| What the pension task force said is actions are going to have to be made in order to shore up future liabilities that the pension system has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4417)|
| 1:13:48| So how did we get here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4428)|
| 1:13:50| It's been mentioned a time or two that in 2000 the liability of Plan F, which at the time was assessed as a potential $50 million liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4430)|
| 1:14:01| was transferred into the current pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| At that time, ladies and gentlemen, that liability for Plan F was a reoccurring operating expense that the City of Knoxville had to pay out of the operating budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4444)|
| 1:14:15| So it was not an invested plan where money was set aside or an interest rate or any other form of monetary gain was being collected to pay that plan out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4455)|
| 1:14:25| Likewise, one thing that has not been mentioned is the liability for the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4465)|
| 1:14:31| It was also transferred into the pension system in 2001 by referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4471)|
| 1:14:38| If you'll take a look at Mr. Pennington's report dated July 1, 2011, which was included as one of the exhibits in the pension task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4478)|
| 1:14:47| that report shows that the current liability for the Board of Education is around $77 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4487)|
| 1:14:55| That's a significant impact on the employee pension system where employees are working and paying into that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4495)|
| 1:15:03| What we tried to get at here is that there's a reason why we suddenly have this looming cost associated to the pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4503)|
| 1:15:12| And it's not just because of some financial issues that came about with the stock market going flat line in 2007-2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4512)|
| 1:15:22| or the economic condition in the United States.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4522)|
| 1:15:25| It was partially due to some decisions that were made in 2000 voted in by referendum in 2001 that added unfunded liabilities to this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4525)|
| 1:15:35| So whenever the actuaries talk about this amount of money that's been amortized over this 24-year period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4535)|
| 1:15:44| these are these unfunded liabilities that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4544)|
| 1:15:47| If you add both of those liabilities together, we're talking about $124 million, $123 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4547)|
| 1:15:54| That's a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| Furthermore, the pension task force recommended that the City of Knoxville make a large one-time investment in the current pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4556)|
| 1:16:03| in order to decrease the anticipated rise in the annual employer contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4563)|
| 1:16:09| Councilman DelVolpe has made the statement today that how does a body deal with the cost and what's a smart decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4569)|
| 1:16:18| I mean, the Roach stood up here and said it takes a long time to save cash to a plan, and that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| It takes a long time to save cash, and the reason being is these liabilities that were assumed to the system back in 2000-2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4584)|
| 1:16:33| the bill is still looming on these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| So this isn't something that just occurred in the last four or five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| This is based on a decision that was made then, and now we're faced with paying the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4600)|
| 1:16:46| What the pension task force recommended as part of their response was this large one-time contribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4606)|
| 1:16:54| and actually that was part of Mr. Pennington's actuary report July 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4614)|
| 1:17:01| If you'll look at his graph, which is included in that report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| he discusses the savings, the potential savings of making a large one-time investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4624)|
| 1:17:11| And actually it's on page 54 if you want to look it up at a later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| It's Alan Pennington's July 1, 2011 experience study, page 54.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4636)|
| 1:17:23| That's what the pension task force was referencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4643)|
| 1:17:27| And based on his reporting adopting that the pension task force recommended a large one-time investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4647)|
| 1:17:34| the city of Knoxville could recognize a savings of $5 million a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4654)|
| 1:17:39| for a potential of $120 million saved during the amortized period through 2036.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4659)|
| 1:17:48| It's just like having a home note or a mortgage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| The more you pay towards the principal now, the less interest you'll pay in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4671)|
| 1:17:57| A potential savings like that for the city of Knoxville would be a wise investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4677)|
| 1:18:04| Finally, where does this money come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| Ultimately, that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| I've seen discussion regarding potential taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4690)|
| 1:18:13| I've seen discussion regarding potential reduction in city services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4693)|
| 1:18:19| A lot of ideas have been cast about by media sources and other individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4699)|
| 1:18:25| But the reality of it is if you'll take a look back at the pension task force recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| that was presented to council, Exhibit 7 specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| this exhibit is a chart provided by the city of Knoxville Finance Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| representing general fund ending fund balances since fiscal year 86-87.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4718)|
| 1:18:45| Since fiscal year 02-03, this balance has grown from $18.4 million to $65 million fiscal year 2010-2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4725)|
| 1:18:58| I asked a point-blank question to Larry Martin whenever we were discussing this matter in the pension task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4738)|
| 1:19:06| and I put it in lay terms, and I'll put it in lay terms to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4746)|
| 1:19:12| What that means is that's $65 million at the end of the year operating expense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4752)|
| 1:19:17| that's not allocated towards any particular fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| It's what's left over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| In addition to that, we've got $28 million currently in the risk and health benefits uncommitted funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4764)|
| 1:19:32| So money is available that could be allocated for a one-time investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4772)|
| 1:19:38| to offset the cost of future potential looming liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4778)|
| 1:19:44| And the last thing I have to say regarding this matter is one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4784)|
| 1:19:48| one phrase that was repeated more than once at the pension task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4788)|
| 1:19:52| not by city employees but by task force members like Bob Cross and others that were sitting on that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4792)|
| 1:19:59| And the theme that they repeated more than once to include all city employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| not just vested but all current employees is a promise made should be a promise kept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4804)|
| 1:20:10| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4810)|
| 1:20:22| Greg Coker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| My name is Greg Coker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4827)|
| 1:20:28| My address is 7714 Norris Freeway, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| I've been employed with the city of Knoxville for over 22 years now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4832)|
| 1:20:35| Right now I'm the elected member to the pension board for the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4835)|
| 1:20:40| And for the April meeting, I prepared some facts and some opinions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| and a statement that I presented to my fellow board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4845)|
| 1:20:48| What I'd like to do for just a couple of minutes tonight is deliver those to you for your consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4848)|
| 1:20:54| as we go forward in this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| It's only going to take a couple of minutes, and I hope you'll indulge me on part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| I'd like to read my statement because I'm not nearly as eloquent a speaker as those who have been before me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4860)|
| 1:21:07| As an elected member and a representative on the pension board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4867)|
| 1:21:11| I feel that I represent not only those members of the police department who have elected me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| but also the entire membership of the city of Knoxville employees pension fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| As such, there are some facts that I believe should be made available to those employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| and others who follow the progress and continuing business of the administration of the pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| It is for these reasons that I make this statement for the record and to be entered in the minutes of today's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4889)|
| 1:21:35| Much has been said over the last 16 months about the current pension system for the city of Knoxville employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4895)|
| 1:21:42| From an outgoing mayoral administration to the pension study committee and some citizen and business groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4902)|
| 1:21:47| it's obvious there's great concern for the health of our pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| While all the concern and long hours of work examining the system are appreciated by those within the system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| the resulting conclusion that the current system is unsustainable has been reached without looking at all the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4916)|
| 1:22:03| The March 2009 end-of-month fund status report showed that the fund had reached a low of $341 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4923)|
| 1:22:12| This was a result of the stock market upheaval of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4932)|
| 1:22:15| As of February 2012, the assets under management had grown to $462 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4935)|
| 1:22:23| This reflects a growth of $121 million in the three years following the stock market events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4943)|
| 1:22:29| that affected pensions across the country, both private and public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| With this positive performance, the obvious question is, how can the system be unsustainable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4953)|
| 1:22:39| Looking at the fund performance over the last 28 years, and those numbers are available, I have those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4959)|
| 1:22:44| it can be seen that while there have been nine years where the growth needed to meet the assumptions was not met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4964)|
| 1:22:50| only four of those years were actually in negative percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4970)|
| 1:22:53| It's also obvious that the years where assumptions were met far outperformed the negative years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4973)|
| 1:22:59| The overall positive performance shown over the 28-year period is another example of the sustainability of this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4979)|
| 1:23:07| Some have advocated closing the current plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| The negative result of this can be seen in the examination of the old teacher's plan and Plan F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4989)|
| 1:23:15| Those plans no longer have employee contributions and are totally funded by the city's input and fund performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=4995)|
| 1:23:22| The results of closing the current plans with the numbers of employees in them would have a dramatically negative effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5002)|
| 1:23:27| on the actuarially required input from the city of Knoxville in the future as employees retire out of the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5007)|
| 1:23:34| Additionally, closing the current plans would not lower the amount of funding on the part of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5014)|
| 1:23:40| With this in mind, why do those who ask for the plans to be closed want to see this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5020)|
| 1:23:47| We're fortunate to have a city administration in place that's given the situation a rational, realistic look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5027)|
| 1:23:53| Hopefully those of the mayors appointed to accomplish this task will see that the time for significant change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5033)|
| 1:23:58| is not in a time of the positive growth we're seeing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| While some change is needed and has been identified by the pension board long before the study committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5042)|
| 1:24:08| major changes or closure of the plan would not be necessary action at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| A common-sense look will hopefully result in the decision to see where this growth takes the pension fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5053)|
| 1:24:18| while allowing the pension board to continue the work we do on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5058)|
| 1:24:22| That work is to examine the performance with the advice of our financial experts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| and continue to work toward the goal of achieving fully funded status in our pension fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5066)|
| 1:24:32| This advice we have received to date from these professionals is responsible for the growth I've pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| I'd personally like to invite each and every council member, a couple at a time because it's a small room, folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| to come to the pension board meetings and see the work we do every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| Be prepared to be there a while because even on simple issues, we make sure we have the right answer before we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5087)|
| 1:24:52| We deliberate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| We get legal advice and financial advice before we make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5094)|
| 1:24:58| I was watching the news a couple of days ago, and Forbes has placed us in the top ten growth cities in the nation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5098)|
| 1:25:05| One of the cited reasons for this was the low crime rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5105)|
| 1:25:10| Now, that's obviously thanks to the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5110)|
| 1:25:13| But I think there's a bigger picture because I think the attractiveness and the viability of the city for relocation of business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5113)|
| 1:25:22| and people moving here and the population increasing is due to the work of every employee here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5122)|
| 1:25:27| those who are here now and those who can't be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5127)|
| 1:25:32| Sweeping negative changes to the pension will do nothing but devalue the service of these employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5132)|
| 1:25:38| and what we do for the city of Knoxville and the progress that we help the city make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5138)|
| 1:25:44| The next election is in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| There is no time rush.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5147)|
| 1:25:50| The growth shows us we do not have to act quickly or rashly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| We've grown $121 million in three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| Let's see where that growth takes us in the next two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| Thank you very much for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| If there are no questions, that's all in my statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5167)|
| 1:26:13| That is the end of the list of speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| I will open it up for council discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5176)|
| 1:26:27| I'm not shy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| You know, I appreciate this meeting because this is one of the meetings that we've planned to get information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5190)|
| 1:26:36| And it's good and there's more than one side to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| And, you know, I think that this is a good meeting to get information about the importance of the pension system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5200)|
| 1:26:47| to the employees, the morale, to their future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| And that's a plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5210)|
| 1:26:51| And everyone in here, I think, probably agrees with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5211)|
| 1:26:54| I think that we need to explore some of the statements made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5214)|
| 1:26:59| Some folks said they had ideas about what we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| I think Ms. Cash actually named a few.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5222)|
| 1:27:04| I think that's an important thing to explore because, at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5224)|
| 1:27:10| regardless of how we got there as a city, we've got to solve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5230)|
| 1:27:15| And the problem is on the cost side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5235)|
| 1:27:18| The problem is how do we afford it, how do we fund it, how do we get it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5238)|
| 1:27:23| And I agree, there's no easy answers to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5243)|
| 1:27:27| This is a complicated problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5247)|
| 1:27:29| But I think it's incumbent upon everyone, the employees, the council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5249)|
| 1:27:34| and the taxpayers who are out there that are asked to foot the bill to work on this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| It may take longer than the 60 days that is the ballot test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5259)|
| 1:27:44| It certainly will take longer to solve all the problems to get on the right footing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5264)|
| 1:27:48| But if we're not on a sound financial footing, we won't be in what the gentleman said, Forbes top 18 list or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5268)|
| 1:27:57| And we can't just use, I think, the rainy day fund as something we cash out and doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5277)|
| 1:28:05| That's what, if you listen to our financial advisors for the city, Mr. York and others, has helped us to get a good bond rating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5285)|
| 1:28:12| We're going to the bond market right now, and we're going to pay less to borrow that $95 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5292)|
| 1:28:18| and pay down more expensive debt, the old mortgage, if you will, and get a cheaper mortgage and save a couple million dollars a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5298)|
| 1:28:26| That's a good thing. That's not a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5306)|
| 1:28:28| That's a tool that's there to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5308)|
| 1:28:30| So we don't just spend all our reserves and find out we're out of cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| That's not a solution either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| There's got to be an approach where there's, you know, four, five, six different things we do that make this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5316)|
| 1:28:43| But it's incumbent on us, and I appreciate you guys out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5323)|
| 1:28:47| And I've been to the Citizens Police Academy several years back, and I know we have a professional police force and that we work well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5327)|
| 1:28:54| I go to Court South and see the firemen working out so they can be in shape to take the 700-pound ladies out of the houses that they go on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5334)|
| 1:29:03| when they get called out, you know, as the first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5343)|
| 1:29:07| They had to cut the doors out of some of those houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5347)|
| 1:29:10| And I understand it's dangerous work and people hurt their backs and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| You know, everybody – and I've seen and I've been out there with the guys from the public service department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5354)|
| 1:29:21| and they work their buns off and they do a good job and they take pride in their work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5361)|
| 1:29:25| and we're proud to have them as our employees in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5365)|
| 1:29:29| But, again, all that said, we've got other people out there that are asked to foot the bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5369)|
| 1:29:34| and we have to be careful how we proceed because I don't know about you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| but I hear from people every day that say, my husband lost my job, the wife lost the job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5378)|
| 1:29:44| we're barely keeping up with our mortgage, don't raise my taxes, we have problems too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5384)|
| 1:29:50| I don't have a pension plan and no one's paying my pension plan if it goes bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| We've got to be sure that as a city we're fair to the citizens because they have to carry this load too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5394)|
| 1:30:01| So working together – and I agree with the suggestions – working together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| we've got to find a way to make it fund and work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| We can't just pull a trigger, but there's got to be a little give everywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5410)|
| 1:30:15| because we've got to make this work financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| This city is moving forward and I want to see it keep moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| I'm excited about some of the things that the city is doing to make the downtown healthy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5422)|
| 1:30:28| to move out and take some of those old neighborhoods that have been run down and make them healthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| I think we're on the right path to making and keeping Knoxville a great place to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5433)|
| 1:30:37| And I don't want to lose that momentum, and I don't want to put it on a shelf for 25 years until we come out of the tunnel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5437)|
| 1:30:43| So, again, it's going to take rolling up our sleeves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5443)|
| 1:30:47| and I think we're going to need some professionals to knock us upside the head and get some facts too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| We can't relive what we did in 2000 and 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5452)|
| 1:30:57| Whatever happened, happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| We're here now, and it's 2012, and we've got to chart the path going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5458)|
| 1:31:04| We won't solve the problem looking in the rearview mirror.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5464)|
| 1:31:07| We've got to look forward through the windshield and find a solution that works for you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5467)|
| 1:31:12| works for the city, works for the taxpayers and everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| So I hope that we keep working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| I appreciate you all's input because it's good input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5476)|
| 1:31:19| and I appreciate the speakers who took some time to prepare their remarks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5479)|
| 1:31:23| They're important to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| I won't be as long as my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| Nobody's as long as you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5490)|
| 1:31:32| You know, that's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5492)|
| 1:31:35| What I do want to say is that I absolutely do appreciate the input that the different groups gave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5495)|
| 1:31:40| and it's obvious to me that they came with the idea that they do have ideas in which they can share with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5500)|
| 1:31:46| And I know that we have another workshop on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| and I was wondering about our schedule for the next week or so because it sounds like we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| not only do we have a lot of work to do if we are going to get something on the ballot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5513)|
| 1:31:57| but what I'd like to see is if we could go ahead and schedule some more meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| and maybe specifically schedule meetings with some of their representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5522)|
| 1:32:07| what they're willing to give and take on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| So I throw that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| And, again, I want to thank all of you for being here, and thank you for your suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| And, Anita, I know that you brought up some ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| and I think it would be a good idea if we met with your different representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5539)|
| 1:32:23| to see what ideas that you all do have that might be able to help all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| And as much as you folks are concerned about your individual groups and the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| we have a responsibility of being concerned about the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| So I think there's a willingness to work both ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5556)|
| 1:32:39| and I hope that, Nick, you can go ahead and get that scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5559)|
| 1:32:42| Yes, I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5562)|
| 1:32:43| And as many nights as it takes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| Let's just get in there and do it on that for the next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5568)|
| 1:32:49| Councilman Campbell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5569)|
| 1:32:50| Thank you, Vice Mayor, and thank you to everybody who's presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| Anita, I was going to ask those who spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5574)|
| 1:32:57| Anita had three specific suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5577)|
| 1:33:00| You said one was tenure vesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| One was cost of living decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| And then the second one, what did you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5585)|
| 1:33:07| Would you repeat that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5587)|
| 1:33:08| You had three, and there was one in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| I missed what you mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5590)|
| 1:33:13| He said 6.25 to 6.5 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| Employee contribution, tenure vesting, and set the COLA for the retiree portion at 2.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5596)|
| 1:33:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| Mr. Taylor or Mr. Faddis may want to refer to the pension task force recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5608)|
| 1:33:34| or you all didn't say anything specific that you could suggest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5614)|
| 1:33:40| I was wondering if you had any quick points that you wanted to say in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5620)|
| 1:33:46| That is something that we're willing to look at, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| but the way we understood it as well, there would be an actuary on those numbers as far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5629)|
| 1:33:55| And what we were kind of talking about is changing the vesting age from five to ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5635)|
| 1:34:00| I know on one of the forms it was or on one of the five plans it was changing age of retirement to 57.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5640)|
| 1:34:08| We say 50 to 55.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| And if new hires look at it and see what 6.25 or 6.5 is, as a matter of fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5651)|
| 1:34:17| one of the first meetings we had we wanted to see what tenure vesting would do by itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5657)|
| 1:34:25| The 50 to 55, what that would do to the actuary by itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5665)|
| 1:34:29| and then see what the 6.25 or 6.5 would do by itself, and then maybe combine them and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5669)|
| 1:34:37| But we don't have any kind of actuarial numbers on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5677)|
| 1:34:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5681)|
| 1:34:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| Councilman Wong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5687)|
| 1:34:49| Yeah, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5689)|
| 1:34:50| We're in the same boat as the firefighters on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5690)|
| 1:34:54| And those are all, if you look around the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5694)|
| 1:35:00| and more specifically you look around Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5700)|
| 1:35:03| the folks that have done that have increased retirement age modestly or for new hires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5703)|
| 1:35:09| or they've increased contribution rates maybe a little bit for new hires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| They've done some things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| That becomes important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5716)|
| 1:35:17| We think that becomes important because people pick your people in our profession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5717)|
| 1:35:23| You put a lot of money into training them and all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| So I'll happily take any sort of things like that back to my membership for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5726)|
| 1:35:32| And we're willing to work on, you know, whatever we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5732)|
| 1:35:36| I think it's important that if we do that, that if we look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5736)|
| 1:35:39| that we don't just look at making up all of the gains in cutting employee benefits, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5739)|
| 1:35:47| because there are some funding policies and stuff that have been in place, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5747)|
| 1:35:54| And I don't bring those things up to talk about the past or to beat anyone over the head with a stick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5754)|
| 1:36:00| But if you want to know how to fix something, it's important to know how it got broken in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5760)|
| 1:36:05| And, you know, if you don't know that, then you can't really do a good job fixing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5765)|
| 1:36:11| And that's not what any of us, the taxpayer, the employees, the leadership needs at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5771)|
| 1:36:17| So I would encourage you, you know, as we do that, I'll happily take that back to my membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5777)|
| 1:36:23| And I encourage you to look at some of these policies over the past to come up with modest policies on the city's part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5783)|
| 1:36:32| in situations where we have years for ten years at a time that we really don't require much funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5792)|
| 1:36:38| And we've got, you know, good returns to maybe making investments in that and hedging for the hard time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5798)|
| 1:36:44| like we would with any other financial obligation that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5804)|
| 1:36:48| Apply those same conservative principles to employees and not just buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5808)|
| 1:36:56| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5816)|
| 1:36:57| It sounds like going forward we'll see where we can work together on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| If you don't mind, I've got a couple real quick ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5820)|
| 1:37:03| Councilman, before you do, if you don't mind, you'd ask about the Pension Task Force?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5823)|
| 1:37:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| That was actually my section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| There was apparently a misunderstanding there because I was not implying that the Pension Task Force said use the entire $65 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5830)|
| 1:37:17| Okay, let me, Councilman Campin has the floor right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5837)|
| 1:37:21| I'll let you address that, but Councilman Campin has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| Okay, well, no, that's fine, Captain Catlin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| Yeah, I think it was yourself who mentioned a large cash infusion might be a good option to beef up the unfunded portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5850)|
| 1:37:37| How much are you talking about how much cash infusion would make it more healthy, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5857)|
| 1:37:42| Actually, it was the Pension Task Force that made that recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| And there was not a specific dollar amount that the Pension Task Force asked for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5867)|
| 1:37:51| but the Pension Task Force did ask Larry Martin how much money in reserve that the city should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5871)|
| 1:37:57| And the response that we were given was one quarter of the operating expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5877)|
| 1:38:01| Of course, Mr. Martin's here now if he'd like to answer it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| I think he'd left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5884)|
| 1:38:08| But he told the Pension Task Force one quarter of operating expense is what should be kept in reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5888)|
| 1:38:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| And lastly, Mr. Coker, you said there were nine years, I believe, out of the 23,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5899)|
| 1:38:25| or since its inception, that they were unsuccessful or unfunded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5905)|
| 1:38:30| When were those years towards the recent, I mean, time right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5910)|
| 1:38:36| or were they in the past or spread out over the period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5916)|
| 1:38:41| The statement was that there were years in which we didn't completely meet the actuarial percentage that was required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5921)|
| 1:38:49| from our investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5929)|
| 1:38:50| And those years are kind of spread out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5930)|
| 1:38:54| And there are nine of them, 1984, 1988, 1994, 2000 through 2003, and clearly 2008 and 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5934)|
| 1:39:06| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5947)|
| 1:39:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5948)|
| 1:39:09| And if I could just take personal privilege.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5949)|
| 1:39:11| I mean, the amounts of money, we keep talking about the $62 or $65 million, however much is in reserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5951)|
| 1:39:18| But I want to call on Ms. Peters to, I mean, there's accounting principles that we adhere to that that money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5958)|
| 1:39:26| not that whole amount is available the way I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5969)|
| 1:39:30| There is a GASB 54 that requires you to classify that $65 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5970)|
| 1:39:38| And if you look in the audited financial statements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5978)|
| 1:39:40| it breaks that classification down into categories as to what's available, what's committed, what's unassigned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5980)|
| 1:39:47| what's non-spendable, what's restricted, and what's assigned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5987)|
| 1:39:51| And the committed portion of that is $34.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5991)|
| 1:39:55| The unassigned portion is $27.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5995)|
| 1:39:59| And then the other small categories of non-spendable, restricted, and assigned equal $2.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=5999)|
| 1:40:06| So we don't have a $65 million fund balance that we can just make even 25% of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6006)|
| 1:40:13| and put into the pension plan and solve our problem going forward and help make an impact, you know, on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6013)|
| 1:40:21| In addition to those classifications that I'm telling you about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6021)|
| 1:40:24| we also had to adopt a fund balance policy last year that was required by GASB also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6024)|
| 1:40:30| the General Accounting Standards Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| And that was required because so many cities have gone, you know, on the side of the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6033)|
| 1:40:41| They have spent more money out of their fund balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| and put themselves into a situation where they haven't been able to meet their obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6043)|
| 1:40:48| So that fund balance policy was in compliance with GASB, and the Audit Committee passed that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6048)|
| 1:40:54| and it is now part of the city policy also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6054)|
| 1:40:58| So we don't have, you know, $50 million that we can use on solving this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6058)|
| 1:41:07| We're going to have to find some other variables and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| possibly some additional funding going above what's actuarially required in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6071)|
| 1:41:17| But it's going to take a lot of give and take and a lot of variables in order to come up with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6077)|
| 1:41:22| that makes a significant impact on these plans that we've got to come up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6082)|
| 1:41:28| Okay. Well, and we're just throwing a lot of numbers around, so I just want everything out on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| that everybody understands, you know, what money, what free cash flow we really need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6092)|
| 1:41:38| Yeah, and I heard a lot of figures being thrown about, and all of them were accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6098)|
| 1:41:42| I mean, I heard a lot of, you know, the last two years the market value has come up on the assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6102)|
| 1:41:48| the return on the assets of the pension fund were up this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| but we've still got to make up for this long-term cost that we've got to make up for here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6112)|
| 1:41:58| and it can't all come from fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| There's no easy solution from the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6120)|
| 1:42:03| Okay. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6123)|
| 1:42:05| I'll go to Councilman Palmer. She hasn't spoken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6125)|
| 1:42:09| Oh, come back to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6129)|
| 1:42:11| Okay, Councilman Walz. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6131)|
| 1:42:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| Just like what Councilman Grieve said, every one of the speakers came and said, we want to work with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6137)|
| 1:42:23| And I think we've got to have some dialogue to say how we can, all right, what does that mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6143)|
| 1:42:29| Let's flush out some of these ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| Every one of them said we were willing to work with you and talk about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6151)|
| 1:42:35| and I think that's somehow we need to get to that and to talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6155)|
| 1:42:40| Everyone complimented Mayor O'Hara on the plan and putting out those plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6160)|
| 1:42:45| Do you like those plans? Do you like that concept?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| I heard some yes, some no. Let's talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| I mean, is that an option?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| I mean, that's what we need to hear is, you know, what are the compromises and how do we get to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6172)|
| 1:42:58| And I don't know if that's the next meeting or, you know, but I'm with Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| I need to hear what, you know, what the compromises could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6182)|
| 1:43:07| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6187)|
| 1:43:09| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| I also appreciate everybody coming and the comments that were made tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6190)|
| 1:43:15| I would remind you that last time when Alan Pennington was here and his, and Gordon Catlin was exactly right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6195)|
| 1:43:23| the report, his experience report of July 1st, 2011, did reflect those, the things that you mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6203)|
| 1:43:30| and the suggested contribution, although Ms. Peters just said we couldn't do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6210)|
| 1:43:36| was $45 million actually under that proposal that he had made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6216)|
| 1:43:41| Now, his assumed rate of return was seven and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| But he also says in his report, and this is what he said last, well, our last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6224)|
| 1:43:49| that our 20-year historical return has only been 5.6 percent on this account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6229)|
| 1:43:55| That's an average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6235)|
| 1:43:57| That's not in any one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| And, in fact, in the last 15 years, the report I received just two days ago, it's 5.68 percent for the past 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6239)|
| 1:44:08| So our returns have not been as good as our assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6248)|
| 1:44:13| And our assumption for many years, I think, was first seven and a half and then eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6253)|
| 1:44:16| and then we lowered it last December, I believe, to seven and three-eighths.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6256)|
| 1:44:23| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6263)|
| 1:44:25| And our actually expected real rate of return is only 5.29 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6265)|
| 1:44:28| So we've got some math problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6268)|
| 1:44:33| As you well know, we are paying out over $40 million a year to the retirees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6273)|
| 1:44:40| and that's exactly what we should be doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| That is going up a minimum of 3 percent a year because of the COLA that we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6283)|
| 1:44:47| And then, of course, if more employees are added to that, that figure does go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6287)|
| 1:44:52| So that's about 9 percent or thereabouts of our corpus, which today is 400, or at the end of March, is $460 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6292)|
| 1:45:03| Actually, at year end, and once again, you were correct, it was 468 at year end in the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6303)|
| 1:45:09| So we are actually a little bit lower now than we were at the year end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6309)|
| 1:45:14| Captain Coker is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| We have earned our way out of the hole, $120 some odd million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6316)|
| 1:45:21| So all these numbers are right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6321)|
| 1:45:23| The problem is, going forward, the corpus that we have and the rate of growth, our average rate of growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6323)|
| 1:45:30| isn't going to solve our problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6330)|
| 1:45:32| And that's not really what we're trying to solve here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6332)|
| 1:45:35| What we're really trying to say is, you know, and I agree with Mr. Wallace, we've got to look and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6335)|
| 1:45:41| is there something different we can do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6341)|
| 1:45:43| And so the mayor has put some suggestions on the table that I think we need to talk about probably either at the next meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6343)|
| 1:45:48| or the following meeting, begin to flesh out and do some what-ifs and see where we might want to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6348)|
| 1:45:54| because we do have a limited amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| But the actuarial shortfall that our actuary indicated to us may be $20 million next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6357)|
| 1:46:06| but overall it's over $130 million at his assumed rate of seven and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6366)|
| 1:46:13| or seven and three-eighths or somewhere in that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| I would suggest that probably seven and three-eighths may be a little bit higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| since our 20-year average is 5.6, just realistically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| Well, if we do that, then the numbers work even worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6384)|
| 1:46:27| So, you know, we can talk about numbers all day, but the point is, our whole goal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6387)|
| 1:46:32| and I think yours is as well, is to make darn sure, and I heard you say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6392)|
| 1:46:36| that we have the proper corpus available to make sure that the benefits that have been indicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6396)|
| 1:46:44| and promised are there to be paid when the time comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| I think that's what we are all about, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6408)|
| 1:46:51| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6411)|
| 1:46:52| I really appreciate these remarks because it's going to help clarify some stuff in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6412)|
| 1:46:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6417)|
| 1:46:58| Thank you, Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6418)|
| 1:46:59| Councilwoman Palmer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6419)|
| 1:47:01| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6421)|
| 1:47:02| I appreciate everyone who came tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| Council very early in January met, and we looked at how we all learn and digest information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6424)|
| 1:47:11| And so this fact-finding is certainly within my system of learning, so I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6431)|
| 1:47:17| We've heard a lot of numbers tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6437)|
| 1:47:18| We've heard a lot of things about the past, and we're obviously looking to the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6438)|
| 1:47:23| I think there are a couple of things that we all need to keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6443)|
| 1:47:27| The voters have approved the charter amendments that have been on the ballot for the drop plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6447)|
| 1:47:34| and some of these other things that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6454)|
| 1:47:37| And I think every council and every administration who worked to take things to the voters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6457)|
| 1:47:43| worked to take a good-faith effort to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6463)|
| 1:47:47| And so I think that we need to keep that in mind, that we're working on another good-faith effort,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6467)|
| 1:47:53| and the voters are expecting us to walk on water and do the best job for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| And I think that's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6478)|
| 1:48:00| But I do think that we need to remember when we are looking at perhaps things in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6480)|
| 1:48:06| that didn't work out as well as we wanted, that at one time or other, everybody bought into whatever it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6486)|
| 1:48:12| And I'd like us to keep that in mind as we're moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6492)|
| 1:48:16| I'm looking forward to really rolling up our sleeves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| and digging into some of the suggestions that were made tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| getting some more very concrete suggestions, dissecting the plans that Mayor O'Hara has brought forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6503)|
| 1:48:30| And, you know, those may be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6510)|
| 1:48:33| Those may not be so great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6513)|
| 1:48:34| We may create something new out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6514)|
| 1:48:36| But I do think that we really need to roll up our sleeves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6516)|
| 1:48:39| and a couple of more meetings won't be nearly enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6519)|
| 1:48:44| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6524)|
| 1:48:46| I'd like to recommend that, you know, we're scheduled for Monday, I think, five to whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6526)|
| 1:48:52| Five-thirty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6532)|
| 1:48:53| And we don't have a council meeting Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| so I'm kind of recommending that maybe we go ahead and meet Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| But it seems to me that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6540)|
| 1:49:03| we have the groups that are willing to come and talk to us about their ideas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| and that if we could schedule that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| And then also I'd like to have the mayor back to give us more detail about their plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6549)|
| 1:49:14| in terms of what they were looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6554)|
| 1:49:16| And then probably also somehow, and I don't know if this is possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6556)|
| 1:49:20| but there may be some taxpayers out there that might like to come and talk to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6560)|
| 1:49:23| and open it up to the general public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| I mean, they have a big interest in this also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| But I think that I'd like to go ahead and recommend that we not only have Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| but we go ahead and meet Tuesday so we don't have a council meeting, if that's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6572)|
| 1:49:37| A couple of issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6577)|
| 1:49:39| One is, you know, the first meeting was the only meeting to where we didn't have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6579)|
| 1:49:44| All the remaining meetings, there will be public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6584)|
| 1:49:48| I mean, we encourage people to come down and talk with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6588)|
| 1:49:54| I think it's probably more prudent for us to look at our calendars over the evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6594)|
| 1:50:00| and I'll have Ms. Wilson poll the council for some not only next week but future dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6600)|
| 1:50:07| And, you know, I'll do it with quick haste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6607)|
| 1:50:11| I mean, I want to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| And if I could for just one second, and I can only speak for myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6613)|
| 1:50:17| I kind of feel like that 700-pound person, Councilman Delvaux, we talked about early in the meeting right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6617)|
| 1:50:23| I mean, I'm not in any hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6623)|
| 1:50:30| If we get to the end of this, if we're not there, then we're not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| I mean, I'm just not, you know, I'm just not in that big a hurry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6634)|
| 1:50:38| I want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6638)|
| 1:50:39| I would much rather sacrifice the two years and do it right rather than be pushed and rushed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6639)|
| 1:50:44| And I feel a little rushed, I'll be honest with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6644)|
| 1:50:46| I mean, I feel like we're up against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6646)|
| 1:50:48| But realizing the magnitude and everything that we've heard tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6648)|
| 1:50:54| I think we've got to really be careful and go at a diligent pace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6654)|
| 1:50:59| But if we're not there at the end, let's not make a bad mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6659)|
| 1:51:03| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6663)|
| 1:51:04| I think that's well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6664)|
| 1:51:11| I think that's well said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6671)|
| 1:51:12| I would like to go back to something Mr. Wallace mentioned earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6672)|
| 1:51:15| and I know I've mentioned in the past, and that is it really would be helpful at one of these workshops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6675)|
| 1:51:20| if we bring the people we pay good money to, the investment counselors, as well as Mr. Pennington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6680)|
| 1:51:25| and some other people back to advise us because this is more than a layman's problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6685)|
| 1:51:31| And we need to hear from people who have that skill set and that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6691)|
| 1:51:38| that reservoir of knowledge to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6698)|
| 1:51:41| And, you know, Mr. Saunders said something that's pretty important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| He says every time you lower the assumption of what the rate of return of this system is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6704)|
| 1:51:51| that means the more dollars have to fall in the pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| So, you know, if we're guessing at a return that doesn't meet our average returns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6714)|
| 1:52:01| we're going to just keep deluding ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6721)|
| 1:52:03| We need to be realistic going forward, and we need to be, you know, creative in how we fund things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6723)|
| 1:52:09| and how we do things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| But let's work on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6730)|
| 1:52:12| Let's hear from everyone that's got some input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| And let's be sure to bring a few professionals that can educate us because this takes some education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6734)|
| 1:52:20| This is not a simple task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6740)|
| 1:52:23| The more you peel off layers, you find more layers underneath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| And it's important to understand the ramifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| I don't think anyone wants to rush forward and make a new mistake, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6749)|
| 1:52:33| That's not a good thing for the community or the workers or anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6753)|
| 1:52:37| And Mr. Pennington will be at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6757)|
| 1:52:40| And when we poll in the morning, I mean, let me know who, you know, if there's people that you want here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6760)|
| 1:52:46| just make those suggestions and I'll do everything in my power to get those folks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6766)|
| 1:52:50| But he is scheduled to be at the next meeting regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6770)|
| 1:52:54| Do we have access to the financial advisor, too, that runs our plans, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6774)|
| 1:53:00| He gets the most money of anybody out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6780)|
| 1:53:02| Why don't you, again, include those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6782)|
| 1:53:06| Include those suggestions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6786)|
| 1:53:07| Overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6787)|
| 1:53:08| And then we'll address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| And then I'll recognize Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| Thank you, Mr. Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6793)|
| 1:53:15| You know, I didn't mean just by the fact that we need to have more meetings and this sort of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6795)|
| 1:53:20| to imply that we rush into trying to make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| Because I firmly agree that the more information that I have so that I can make a better decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6803)|
| 1:53:28| I just think that this is such a crucial and critical item that we can't wait week after week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6808)|
| 1:53:34| we need to go ahead while we're on a roll and get started and get these meetings going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6814)|
| 1:53:38| So if we can get the schedule together so that all of us can plan, I think that's what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6818)|
| 1:53:43| But I fully agree with you that if at the end of the day we don't have a good decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| then we don't go to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6827)|
| 1:53:49| Yeah, no, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6829)|
| 1:53:50| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6830)|
| 1:53:51| I just want to make sure that, you know, we're going to keep working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6831)|
| 1:53:57| but at the end of the day, if we're not there, we're just not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| Could I ask a question to Anita?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| The discussion that you had with the variables that you changed, does Alan Pennington have those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6842)|
| 1:54:08| and is he bringing that graph to us to show us the impact that those would have on the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6848)|
| 1:54:15| I talked to him again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6855)|
| 1:54:16| I think it was last night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6856)|
| 1:54:18| It may have been Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6858)|
| 1:54:19| It's not that significant of a savings, any of them or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6859)|
| 1:54:24| I had the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6864)|
| 1:54:25| They're upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6865)|
| 1:54:26| I don't have them with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6866)|
| 1:54:27| But none of them are significant savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6867)|
| 1:54:30| It doesn't seem to be any different than these other options that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6870)|
| 1:54:34| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| If I recall correctly, the vesting would take a long time to ever see an impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6876)|
| 1:54:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| Because of the way people who currently leave the city, they take their money anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6882)|
| 1:54:47| and it would be the same for those other people if they left within that ten-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6887)|
| 1:54:54| The only thing that you could absolutely see any impact right away on would be the employee contribution increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6894)|
| 1:55:05| But when we call, I mean, I don't mind to call him and ask him to bring them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6905)|
| 1:55:11| I was just curious if he had been asked to calculate those and bring them so we could see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6911)|
| 1:55:16| He asked for more information on the numbers that I asked him, and so that's what I provided him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6916)|
| 1:55:21| But his initial thing was that none of them were that savings-oriented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6921)|
| 1:55:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| And just out of courtesy, I mean, the administration addressed us at the first meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6929)|
| 1:55:34| but I just didn't know if, Mayor O'Hara, I mean, you're not on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6934)|
| 1:55:39| but I certainly would not want to exclude you if you did have any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6939)|
| 1:55:54| Thank you, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6954)|
| 1:55:55| Thank you, Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6955)|
| 1:55:56| And thank you to all the employees who have been here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| This has been a really good, good discussion, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| And I just want you all to know and the employees to know, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| when we presented those scenarios just a couple weeks ago, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6966)|
| 1:56:11| and thank you, Captain Catlett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| Where are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| We put those out knowing that it would be a dartboard, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6976)|
| 1:56:21| that everybody could then kind of tear them apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6981)|
| 1:56:24| But our job was to get some ideas out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6984)|
| 1:56:27| And so we are very happy to run any numbers that you all want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6987)|
| 1:56:32| I know Kevin asked for some specific things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6992)|
| 1:56:35| abide themselves to see the impact of 5 to 10 on the vesting, 50 to 55,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=6995)|
| 1:56:41| on the age and the change on the employee investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7001)|
| 1:56:45| We'll be glad to ask Mr. Pennington to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7005)|
| 1:56:48| If there's other numbers you'd like us to run, we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7008)|
| 1:56:50| But we are not wedded to any of those we put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7010)|
| 1:56:53| Tear them apart, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| But we wanted to get something out so you all would have something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| and the employees would have something to push against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7018)|
| 1:57:00| and hopefully come to something that works, you know, for us as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7020)|
| 1:57:05| and that protects our employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7028)|
| 1:57:10| I think that's my point is that I would like, I'm asking for Captain Catlett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7030)|
| 1:57:17| and Anita and others to take those plans that she's presented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7037)|
| 1:57:21| and come back and talk about what the good aspects of them are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7041)|
| 1:57:24| and what the bad aspects of them are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7044)|
| 1:57:26| If they're all bad, if you see no benefit in any of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7046)|
| 1:57:28| then, you know, let us know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| If you can come back Monday night and say we like certain aspects of it or don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7050)|
| 1:57:35| I mean, I think that's really what I'd like to hear about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7055)|
| 1:57:39| And, you know, she's put them out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7059)|
| 1:57:41| You all throw your darts at them specifically and say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7061)|
| 1:57:44| I think you've got to recognize we have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| And I think that if everybody can come to the table and say we have a long-term issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7067)|
| 1:57:52| and how can we come together and work on trying to solve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7072)|
| 1:57:56| And we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7076)|
| 1:57:57| But if we draw lines in the sand and say, well, you know, then we won't get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7077)|
| 1:58:02| But, I mean, I'm certainly willing to listen and talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7082)|
| 1:58:05| Now, she's put the plans out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7085)|
| 1:58:08| I'd like to talk specifically about those plans and, you know, what the pluses and minuses are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7088)|
| 1:58:13| Well, and that's the way, you know, this has been designed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| I mean, we wanted to, you know, get the presentation on the front end from Mr. Pennington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7096)|
| 1:58:22| We want to most certainly hear from the employee groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7102)|
| 1:58:25| We'll hear from the heads of the employee groups or the uniformed bodies anyway next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7105)|
| 1:58:31| But that will be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7111)|
| 1:58:32| And then the rest of it will be this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7112)|
| 1:58:35| And I would assume that all the interested parties would be here to where we can work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7115)|
| 1:58:41| and find a solution if there's one out there right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7121)|
| 1:58:45| So I think the next meeting is going to be that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7125)|
| 1:58:48| Councilman Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7128)|
| 1:58:50| Who do we have scheduled on our next workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7130)|
| 1:58:53| We have Chief Sharp and Roush and Mr. Pennington will be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7133)|
| 1:58:59| And I don't know of any other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7139)|
| 1:59:01| Nobody else is scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7141)|
| 1:59:02| So the vast majority of the meeting was going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7142)|
| 1:59:08| Mayor, Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| Is it proper to ask that Vicki Hatfield be here on behalf of all the employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7151)|
| 1:59:17| I reached out to Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7157)|
| 1:59:19| Is she out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| I don't know that they were going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7162)|
| 1:59:24| No, I mean on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7164)|
| 1:59:26| That's what I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7166)|
| 1:59:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7167)|
| 1:59:28| And I don't know that unless something's changed, I don't think they're going to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7168)|
| 1:59:40| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7180)|
| 1:59:41| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7181)|
| 1:59:42| If you come to the microphone, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| Give your name and your title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| Vicki Hatfield, Civil Service Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7188)|
| 1:59:51| I had been asked to come and speak along with Chief Sharp and Chief Roush on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7191)|
| 1:59:57| So I was intending to do that, and I was under the assumption that it had already been put on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7197)|
| 2:00:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7204)|
| 2:00:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7208)|
| 2:00:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7209)|
| 2:00:10| We'll look forward to seeing you Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7210)|
| 2:00:13| Easy enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7213)|
| 2:00:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| That was fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7216)|
| 2:00:18| One other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7218)|
| 2:00:19| If anyone is looking, keep it short, real short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7219)|
| 2:00:23| If anyone has seen the packet that the task force worked with in terms of information, it was kind of humongous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7223)|
| 2:00:29| I'm wondering if there isn't a smaller subset of really crucial information that we can put in a notebook| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7229)|
| 2:00:37| or something as study for our own benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7237)|
| 2:00:43| I mean, whether it's reports from Pennington, whether it's analyses someone has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7243)|
| 2:00:47| but we put together some of this stuff because I don't think you can sit in a meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7247)|
| 2:00:51| and absorb all these figures without sitting slowly and reading them and trying to understand them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7251)|
| 2:00:56| We might want to get a little information pack together of informative stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7256)|
| 2:01:00| that we can be speeding up our own education instead of just hearing it from microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7260)|
| 2:01:06| I'll work at your pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7266)|
| 2:01:09| If you'll just let me know what you want, I'll do my best to gather it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120419?start=7272)|
