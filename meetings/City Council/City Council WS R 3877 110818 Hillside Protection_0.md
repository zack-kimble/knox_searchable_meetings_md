| 0:01:02| Commissioner Owenby if he would lead us in the pledge of the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=62)|
| 0:01:04| Blessed by our heads, dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for this, another beautiful day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=64)|

| 0:01:29| Salute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=89)|
| 0:01:30| Pledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=91)|
| 0:01:37| which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=97)|
| 0:01:47| First on the agenda, we have some introductory matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=107)|
| 0:01:49| Vice Mayor Bailey, do you have anything you'd like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=109)|
| 0:01:51| Not at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=111)|
| 0:01:52| Also, Councilman Roddy, I understand you're going to need to be leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| You were recognized, if you'd like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=115)|
| 0:01:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=117)|
| 0:01:58| Thank you, Commissioner Hammond, or Chairman Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=118)|
| 0:01:59| I have a previous engagement this evening, and will need to leave about 530.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| And I apologize to the assembled body and to the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=122)|
| 0:02:05| That's all the introductory matters we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=125)|
| 0:02:08| So, Mr. Joyner, the stage is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=128)|
| 0:02:11| And if you would, I guess the first thing on the agenda is a review and summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=131)|
| 0:02:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=135)|
| 0:02:38| It's been a really interesting couple of weeks, because I've had opportunity to meet a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| of wonderful people in the community and hear what they had to say about their perceptions of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=162)|
| 0:02:47| and where we're going to head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| As always, as your facilitator, I want to remind us a few things tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| And I think tonight's particularly important to remind ourselves of process and ground rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=175)|
| 0:03:00| because tonight I think we're going to talk about the heart of the matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=180)|
| 0:03:03| Ground rules for tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=183)|
| 0:03:06| We're going to have basically two topics for discussion tonight overall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| We're going to talk about slope and clearing, and density comes into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=192)|
| 0:03:16| There are primary discussions about the issues of slope, grading, and clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| There's all kinds of other things that go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=201)|
| 0:03:24| You guys know better than I do how these things don't really tease out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=204)|
| 0:03:28| But here's the difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| When we start talking about something as complex or as emotional as some of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=210)|
| 0:03:34| there's a tendency for us to kind of chase rabbits and somebody will bring something else up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=214)|
| 0:03:39| One of my jobs is to keep us on task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=219)|
| 0:03:41| So tonight we're going to talk about those two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=221)|
| 0:03:44| I'm going to have a list page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=224)|
| 0:03:45| If you bring up something else that's important to you and I don't think it's on task,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=225)|
| 0:03:48| I'm going to put it on my topic list page, and we can see if we can deal with that either in another setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=228)|
| 0:03:52| or at another time, because I want to make sure that we stay on task tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| My goal is to provide a process that allows you to make a well-informed decision and that you own it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=238)|
| 0:04:04| Second rule of the night is we're all going to be courteous, but if somebody gets upset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| we have a rule that only one person can be mad at a time in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=248)|
| 0:04:13| So if somebody gets upset, I'll probably call them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| We're all going to be okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=257)|
| 0:04:18| Be sure and use your lights so we can follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=258)|
| 0:04:21| Third, I know we know this, but sometimes when something's been going on as long as this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=261)|
| 0:04:28| and we feel as strongly as some people in this room feel about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=268)|
| 0:04:32| in this instance, people tend to think their job is to make their point as clearly as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=272)|
| 0:04:41| And in some instance, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| So part of the discussion tonight, we'll have a chance for everybody to advocate their point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=284)|
| 0:04:50| That's called the force field discussion where everybody gets to give their point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| Then we're going to move to a discussion that's more about how do we manage those differences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| and we've got to change gears when we go there, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=300)|
| 0:05:02| You understand what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| So there's going to be a point where we're talking pretty clear about I believe this and I believe that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| and then we're going to move to the kind of options and solutions side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=307)|
| 0:05:11| and I'm going to need you guys to start thinking, okay, I understand where they're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=311)|
| 0:05:15| How do we deal with each other and come up with something we can both live with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=315)|
| 0:05:18| or at least acknowledge one another's point of view?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| And finally, we've got to remind ourselves the goal of this facilitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| I doubt seriously when we leave here two hours from now, everybody's going to agree we're going to sing Kumbaya| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=329)|
| 0:05:34| and everybody's going to go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=334)|
| 0:05:37| I mean if that happens, I'm really going to be impressed with myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=337)|
| 0:05:40| because I don't think that's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=340)|
| 0:05:43| What this is about is having a discussion that allows you to not only understand where you're at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| but where everybody else is, and allowing you to have a process that when you leave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=348)|
| 0:05:54| there's clarity in your own mind about what you believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| and clarity about the other points of view so that when you come around to vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=357)|
| 0:06:01| you can do it from yourself and not from a lot of other stuff going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=361)|

| 0:06:13| And that may be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=373)|
| 0:06:14| It may be we get to where, hey, we may need to amend it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| But it mostly is about a process where everybody's clear with one another about their own place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=378)|
| 0:06:23| clear about where they stand, and clear about what the options might be to manage the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=383)|
| 0:06:29| I think those are key understandings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=389)|

| 0:06:40| That won't take more than five or ten minutes at most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| We have several experts in the audience here or people who are professionals in the field if we need them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=404)|

| 0:07:33| Then the second hour talking about clearing and grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| That's acceptable, everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| In terms of review, in the first session, we established why it's an important conversation for us to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=463)|
| 0:07:51| Overall, I heard it was a matter of establishing a balance between having good business environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=471)|
| 0:07:56| honoring property rights of individuals, while protecting the trees, land, and water that's the heart of East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=476)|

| 0:08:04| Second session, we had a very good session, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| We established that under current state statutes, the process allows and may even require that citizens have the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=487)|
| 0:08:14| to appeal any decision made by appointed boards like MPC or zoning board to either the city council or the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=494)|
| 0:08:22| In other words, we understood, and that's what the memo from legal confirmed for both the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=502)|
| 0:08:30| that everyone has a right for those elected officials to respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| These elected bodies have the right to overturn any suggestion or decision made by the appointed boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| You'll notice in the back, I think I emailed you, but also gave you a paper copy of that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=519)|
| 0:08:46| Dan, is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=526)|
| 0:08:50| Got a nod, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| I want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=531)|
| 0:08:59| They did say that this policy will amend the general plan of 2033 and will necessitate bringing current regulation in line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=539)|
| 0:09:07| that currently exists in line with this policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| However, according to them, nothing is written in stone and these policies can be interpreted by elected bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=551)|
| 0:09:17| if the MPC interpretation is not acceptable to an individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| That is what I understand that you guys had said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=561)|
| 0:09:28| Dan, is there anything from legal's point of view?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| Is there anything you want to add to what I've said or want to clarify about the memo that's been out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| I don't think there's anything I need to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=575)|
| 0:09:37| However, I'm here for questions if there are any that come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| At this time, do any of you have any questions of legal about what has been presented to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| either by me or by someone else at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=584)|
| 0:09:49| Everybody comfortable with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=589)|

| 0:10:16| I thought all the individuals were very articulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| They were all very passionate, if you can believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=618)|
| 0:10:22| Most of them were really, really nice and we had a great conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=622)|
| 0:10:27| Most, if not all, were very courteous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| The following groups were represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| They represented the following groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| I'm not going to name who all was there, but I thought it would be interesting for you to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| We had representatives of the League of Women Voters, representatives of the Tea Party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| the Homeowners Associations, landowners, developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=640)|
| 0:10:43| and I think it was also representing builders at that point, the environmental community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=643)|
| 0:10:47| members of the task force, representatives of the soil science community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| I thought a very broad, good representation of people in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=651)|
| 0:10:55| They were able to come in and say, this is what we think about it and this is why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=655)|
| 0:10:59| You'll notice on the first page of your notes, I think the markings make it even more confusing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=659)|
| 0:11:06| but it says three and green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=666)|
| 0:11:09| Pages three and four in green are the summary of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=669)|
| 0:11:20| I won't spend much time on it, but I want to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| There's no way to adequately, you can imagine the amount of information that was handed to me during that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=682)|
| 0:11:28| But I think these bullet points summarize the concerns on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=688)|
| 0:11:34| You've heard them before, but I want to clarify them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| There is a belief, those opposed to the plan, that the council and commission should leave the current policies in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| and enforce the requirements and policies rather than develop new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=703)|
| 0:11:47| There's concern about violating owners' property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=707)|
| 0:11:51| They should manage their land without undue governmental interference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=711)|
| 0:11:56| There was concern the new policies will lower property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| There was the statement that existing structures in town violate this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=721)|
| 0:12:05| They've been no problem with those structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=725)|
| 0:12:07| Why should we then worry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| Others talked about what they perceived to be a poor notification process of affected parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| that people should be given better notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| Others felt like it gave too much control of the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| The process of approval was unclear in this policy was the belief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=741)|
| 0:12:25| That the plan significantly expanded the amount of land under regulation, that concerns some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| That the plan took away the power of the professional developers to clear and grade as they saw fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=750)|
| 0:12:36| The current policy is not as clearly and tightly defined and allows some flexibility for developers and builders as they saw fit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=756)|
| 0:12:44| and they saw that as a positive rather than taking that away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=764)|
| 0:12:49| Some believe the county would be hurting their tax base by limiting building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=769)|
| 0:12:53| Others thought the policy was too ambiguous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=773)|
| 0:12:56| They thought ordinances should be described by elected officials and not left to MPC for interpretation was their belief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=776)|
| 0:13:03| And finally, at least a couple of groups questioned the legal terms of slope and ridgetops,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=783)|
| 0:13:10| that it wasn't clearly defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=790)|
| 0:13:12| And they thought perhaps the county, the city, and MPC might even have different policies in terms of ridgetop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=792)|
| 0:13:18| That would summarize the concerns against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=798)|
| 0:13:21| The concerns for were equally articulate and I thought well presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=801)|
| 0:13:26| They said this is page four marked in purple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| This policy will increase property values because planned development will occur that's more environmentally friendly with planned green spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=809)|
| 0:13:38| That the property rights below, and others believe the property rights below the elevated land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| of those who live below the elevated land must be considered also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=823)|
| 0:13:47| The victims of flooding and slidings have a right to protect their land values and property rights just like those on elevated land masses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=827)|
| 0:13:54| I believe this statement was made, but I checked and that may be incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| One person stated there's been plenty of notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=839)|
| 0:14:01| The task force hosted 13 community meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| I read nine, but that was what was stated to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| The enforcement of new policy must take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| This document doesn't mean anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=851)|
| 0:14:13| There was a concern that even though it's supported, if it's not enforced, it's not helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=853)|
| 0:14:20| Their statement about slope, which we'll talk about tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| is their understanding was the slope requirements were almost the same as the current slope requirements in the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| And the current plan only deviates by adding requirements above 40%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| Another stated this document is a policy that allows individuals to appeal to legislative bodies if they disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=874)|
| 0:14:42| It doesn't give NPC too much power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| Another group stated the policy sets forth formulas for regulating clearing and grading where there's been no enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| or understood expectation for clearing grading in the county in the past, at least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| This standard is important because stormwater runoff is causing flooding problems and must be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| It was brought to my attention that current EPA standards mandate that the first inch of rainwater must not run off a development at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=903)|
| 0:15:13| And this plan puts practices into place that address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=913)|
| 0:15:19| So there's concerns whether we're dealing properly with EPA requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=919)|
| 0:15:25| And someone else said this plan wasn't much longer and no more complicated than the tree conservation plan that's already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=925)|
| 0:15:32| I think they said it was 68 pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| And they were concerned that the argument that the tree policy plan was in place is not any more complicated or convoluted than this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=934)|
| 0:15:43| And finally, somebody pointed out, I think from the NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| that the GIS markings of the designated areas are now much better than the hand-drawn markings before, and they thought that was a positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=947)|
| 0:15:55| So that kind of summarizes what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| I don't know if that answers all of our questions, but I think it's fascinating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=958)|
| 0:16:02| And I think it helps us as we move that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=962)|
| 0:16:06| Any comments or questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| I don't want to spend too much time on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| And I just told you what they told me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| I'm not going to argue fact at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| I just share a perception with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=975)|
| 0:16:19| We good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=979)|
| 0:16:22| Good with your history of what you learned in your...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| Do you understand what they said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=986)|
| 0:16:28| Yeah, that does not necessarily cover the waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| Oh, not at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| All I gave you is what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| And I wanted you to know what those representative groups said to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| And I didn't write down everything everybody said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=997)|
| 0:16:40| I am sure there's somebody out there right now who's saying, you know, he didn't mention what I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| But I gave you, I think, the good cross-section of what came from the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| Thank you for helping me clarify that, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| Let's begin our discussion about the topic at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1020)|
| 0:17:14| The way we're going to do this is we will clarify what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1034)|
| 0:17:22| We're going to discuss the key issues involved in each of these, slope, clearing, and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1042)|
| 0:17:26| I won't really separate density out as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1046)|
| 0:17:29| It becomes part of the slope and clearing discussion, but it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| And then we will analyze strengths and weaknesses on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1052)|
| 0:17:37| And then we'll be able to clarify those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| And then we'll talk about options for how to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1060)|
| 0:17:42| How do we meet interests of most groups and stay at the heart of the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| You saw I put up here, this is not meant to be comprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1066)|
| 0:17:53| It's meant to be a reminder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| I put on the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1075)|
| 0:17:57| This was taken, this particular documents were taken directly from the MPC sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1077)|
| 0:18:06| where the facts and questions section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| And this is what is being proposed to the public as the facts in terms of slope and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1090)|
| 0:18:18| General plan, let's see if I can find it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1098)|
| 0:18:20| General plan 2033, section 7.6 says this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1100)|
| 0:18:25| This is the plan that's currently in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1105)|
| 0:18:28| It says, 7.6, to reclaim our rights to clean and air water,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| it says one, restrict development on slopes greater than 15% and along streams and rivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1114)|
| 0:18:41| Housing densities on 15 to 25% slopes are two dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1121)|
| 0:18:49| Housing densities on slopes greater than 25%, one dwelling per two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1129)|
| 0:18:56| Non-residential uses on slopes over 15% via a planned development zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| and flood plains limit uses to 50% in a flood fringe area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| That's the policy that's currently in place, as far as I can tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1147)|
| 0:19:13| You have then, within the plan, policies that can respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1153)|
| 0:19:20| That is page, I believe it's page one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| Well, I think it's page two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| Slope comparisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| What I want to do, before we start the discussion, is straight up compare the two policies so you'll see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| I think it's important to kind of cut to the chase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| There may be a question I'm going to have to ask the MPC to qualify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| because it seemed like I saw two different statements, but I'm sure it's my lack of understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| not any kind of mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| Here we notice it says, comparison one, slopes of less than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| Any use allowed of property zoning base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| However, where's Mark at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| Mark, if you could answer this, step up and answer this for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| I also saw in the plan, it said property less than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1205)|
| 0:20:08| I believe it said six dwellings per acre within the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| Can you kind of tell the difference between that statement of any use plus six dwellings per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| With regard to residential uses, and we then look at the growth policy plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1216)|
| 0:20:23| and the urban growth area versus the planned growth area, city versus county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1223)|
| 0:20:29| Generally, in the city or in the urban growth area, we will use six units per acre as that base| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1229)|
| 0:20:36| to apply to areas less than 15% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| In the planned growth areas in the county, we will use five units per acre as the maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1240)|
| 0:20:46| to apply to that area below 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1246)|
| 0:20:50| The statement of any use allowed is probably not as particularly accurate as that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1250)|
| 0:20:56| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1256)|
| 0:20:57| The uses certainly are allowed, but any density allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| Density allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1260)|
| 0:21:01| I want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| I just want to make sure of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| The use can be as, but the density, as you see right there under slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| is within the county, five units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| I'm not sure we got that right up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| Is that correct, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| And within the city, six units per acre, which isn't a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1273)|
| 0:21:17| In the 15 to 25%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Can you repeat that one more time about the density in city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| and the difference between the current regulations and the first one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Mark, why don't you say it one more time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1296)|
| 0:21:37| Let's just deal with that area, less than 15% slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1297)|
| 0:21:40| that would happen to be within the hillside and ridgetop protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| There is a significant chunk of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| If it's in the city and it's classified as low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| we will assign up to six units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1313)|
| 0:21:57| In the county, if it's classified as low-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| we will assign up to five units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| And then there are some areas where the land-use plan is calling for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| medium-density residential within the HRPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| And in the city, we use up to 24 units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| In the county, we use up to 12 units to the acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| Again, that's for that base area below 15% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1339)|
| 0:22:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1343)|
| 0:22:24| And there is no change from what I understand from the NPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| there's no change below 15% within the current policy and the new policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1348)|
| 0:22:34| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1354)|
| 0:22:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1355)|
| 0:22:37| Does that help, Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1357)|
| 0:22:39| There is no change between current policy and new policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1359)|
| 0:22:45| On less than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1365)|
| 0:22:47| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1367)|
| 0:22:48| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| Commissioner, if you would put your microphone down when you talk again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1370)|
| 0:22:53| I'm not sure about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1373)|
| 0:22:54| Here's what you have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| Yes, there's no change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1375)|
| 0:22:56| but I think some of these clearing and grading plans is a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| That's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1380)|
| 0:23:01| We're talking slope only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1381)|
| 0:23:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1382)|
| 0:23:03| Slope only is all we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| There is a significant difference in clearing and grading, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| But in terms of slope only, that's our topic at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| Slope only, there's no change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1392)|
| 0:23:14| Slope as it affects density is what you're really talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1397)|
| 0:23:18| Slope affects grading and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| But slope in terms of density at this point is what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| We'll separately talk about clearing and grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| But you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| It's difficult, Councilman, because they all interact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| and yet trying to sort them out to talk is an interesting conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| All right, slopes between 15% and 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| Once again, if I understand this correctly, there's not a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| Residential use is up to two dwellings per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| with various policies being adopted for limited office, medium density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| commercial uses, including the technology corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| and residential use up to two dwellings per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| with limited office density and commercial use on hillside areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| Now, in terms of the commercial, there may be some change on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1440)|
| 0:24:05| I'll go back to Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| I want to talk about residential and low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| There's no change at 15 to 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1452)|
| 0:24:14| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| In terms of medium density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| The plan recommends that, yeah, there's no change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| The plan recommends the development of medium density housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1464)|
| 0:24:27| on slopes less than 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| So you need to see that in terms of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| the plan recommends only less than 15% on commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| or medium density development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1479)|
| 0:24:43| So everybody somewhat clear on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1483)|
| 0:24:52| Doug?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1494)|
| 0:24:57| On the 15 to 25, I see medium density in both black and blue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1497)|
| 0:25:09| What was just said about medium density then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| Well, yeah, these factors are used in calculating an overall density budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1512)|
| 0:25:20| for a proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| So if a project or a parcel comes in for a rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1522)|
| 0:25:29| we would recommend planned residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| and then we would prepare a density recommendation using these factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| We will use for the base, for that area of the property that's less than 15%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1537)|
| 0:25:45| we will use those base numbers that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| We will also assign, in the 15 to 25% slope range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1548)|
| 0:25:53| a density factor of two units to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| regardless of whether the project is medium density or low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| So they will get credit for some units on that slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| The plan recommends that we put those units on the flat parts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1567)|
| 0:26:12| but they would get credit for units for land that has that slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1572)|
| 0:26:17| That is unchanged from current policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| So clarify this for me because I'm slow more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| I'm probably the slowest person here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1582)|
| 0:26:25| So you're telling me that even though it's listed that there can be limited office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1585)|
| 0:26:31| and minimum density commercial on hillsides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1591)|
| 0:26:33| you're saying you're recommending that not take place, but you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| There's an opportunity that may take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| The plan recommends that if you're going to do it in that slope area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| do it with small footprints and use tuck under garage to minimize the disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1602)|
| 0:26:48| So at what I hear you saying then, at the residential level there's no change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1608)|
| 0:26:55| but at the medium density there are changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1615)|
| 0:26:59| The recommendation is not to build there, but if they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| there are certain ways they can build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| The proposed policy may be new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1626)|
| 0:27:20| Yeah, I think the current policy is quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| There's no comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| On the location of medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1645)|
| 0:27:29| Got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| So this is a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1651)|
| 0:27:33| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| So the medium density would be different because it is now discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| where in the past it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| It recommends the use of smaller footprints and tuck under parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1660)|
| 0:27:46| So on the limited office, on the medium density and commercial use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1666)|
| 0:27:50| that has changed from current practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| Yeah, that would be a new policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1679)|
| 0:28:00| So there's been that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| Commissioner Burrells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| I was about to call Commissioner Anders and I realized that Brad was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| so that's nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| Oh, is Brad there too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1687)|
| 0:28:08| I'll be both of us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1688)|
| 0:28:11| So there is no change for residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| but the change for commercial and limited office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1696)|
| 0:28:23| the only change is that it makes a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| It's not a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1708)|
| 0:28:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1709)|
| 0:28:30| And keep in mind that of the 130,000 plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1710)|
| 0:28:35| or minus acres in the proposed hillside and rooftop protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1715)|
| 0:28:39| about 98% of it has low density or rural residential land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1719)|
| 0:28:46| So you're talking about about 2% of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1726)|
| 0:28:49| This is a case of what you're saying is it hasn't been addressed before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1729)|
| 0:28:54| and now it's being addressed at a level of recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1734)|
| 0:28:58| And it is a change, as Commissioner Owenby said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| but I wanted to clarify what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Yeah, Mark, I had just one question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| and I'll probably ask this about each of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| and each one of the things that we go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| But you said that in medium density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| if they were, for instance, wanting to put an office or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| they would have to design it differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1759)|
| 0:29:21| or it would be recommended that they design it differently than what they do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1761)|
| 0:29:26| But my question really deals with, you know, I'll call it special circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1766)|
| 0:29:33| Would they have the right to appeal that, depending on the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| either to the BZA or to the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1777)|
| 0:29:41| to say there are certain things about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1781)|
| 0:29:43| Yes, because it doesn't fall into the definition that the NPC has to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| but we feel that there are special circumstances here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1787)|
| 0:29:50| because of the surrounding slope, the soil type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1790)|
| 0:29:54| You know, there's probably a dozen reasons that could come up that we can't think of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1794)|
| 0:29:58| They would have the right to appeal that either to the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1798)|
| 0:30:02| or to the BZA to allow it to proceed the same way it would now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1802)|
| 0:30:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1809)|
| 0:30:10| And this is sort of a legal question, too, is that how binding is this plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1810)|
| 0:30:16| How inflexible is it or how flexible is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| So what happens when someone thinks they have a good plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| but yet it would be rejected by the plan the way it stands?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1823)|
| 0:30:30| That issue is addressed in several different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1830)|
| 0:30:33| One, in the event that somebody already has a land use classification and zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1833)|
| 0:30:39| that allows office or medium-density residential without plan review, the NPC is out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1839)|
| 0:30:47| They go directly to permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| In the case where they are proposing a change in the plan or a change in the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1850)|
| 0:30:57| then NPC is in the position of making a recommendation to the legislative bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| So the legislative body is the final arbiter of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| And then in the plan, there is a recommendation for the creation of special commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1866)|
| 0:31:13| and office districts when there are locational or environmental criteria where that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1873)|
| 0:31:22| So that would support the change in the land use plan as well as the change in the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1882)|
| 0:31:29| to support commercial or office or medium-density residential uses in particular areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1889)|
| 0:31:37| So you come down talking to somebody like me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| It sounds like what you're saying is that when the commissioner says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| can they appeal it to BZA and or the commission, you're saying yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1908)|
| 0:31:49| I guess let me say the one I'm trying to address are some of these bullet points on page 3 that was given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1909)|
| 0:31:57| It says this is one of the complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| We heard this again and again and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| that this plan gives too much control to the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| And, I mean, even if the Planning Commission is following it all down, we have the professional staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1925)|
| 0:32:12| then we have the NPC itself votes on this, they would have the right to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| I mean, even if it's denied, just flat out denied by the NPC because it doesn't meet any of these criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1937)|
| 0:32:24| that you had mentioned, they can't have the special circumstances, they can't do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| they still, and I'm sort of asking this to the legal people also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1948)|
| 0:32:32| they would have the right to still appeal this to the appropriate appellate board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1956)|
| 0:32:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| So, I mean, it may give a lot of power to the NPC, but they still have an appeals process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1959)|
| 0:32:45| The appeals process would kick in in the event that there is already in place a planned zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1965)|
| 0:32:51| which assigns development plan approval authority to the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| That decision is appealable in the city to city council in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| That's what I mean by the appropriate appellate board, whether that's the city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| county commission, or the BZAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| I've got to confirm that with Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| And also, I believe there's even statute that's come down recently that confirms that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1992)|
| 0:33:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1995)|
| 0:33:17| Well, there have always been statutes that provide administrative appeals and then eventually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=1997)|
| 0:33:23| and ultimately appeal to the courts of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2003)|
| 0:33:25| So there won't ever be a land use decision that's not appealable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2005)|
| 0:33:30| That would be a violation of due process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2010)|
| 0:33:32| But decisions that come out of the NPC will be appealable either to the city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| or the county commission and then eventually to the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| So there's several layers of administrative review and then eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2020)|
| 0:33:44| Really why I mention this is that I think most developers want to keep this out of the courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| because things can be tied up for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| And if they have options on, most of the time they have options on land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| and they're not going to buy the land until they have the appropriate zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| But usually with the appeals that are made to the city council, the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| or the various BZAs, that can be handled within a month or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2043)|
| 0:34:07| which still would fit into an economic timeline that they could deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| When it goes to the courts, it can be a year's process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| And most of them would say if it's going to go to the courts, then they've lost because they can't afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| So to move this along, I want to confirm that we understand that they can appeal to the elected body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2061)|
| 0:34:25| if they're unhappy or feel like they have special circumstance with the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2065)|
| 0:34:30| From what I see of the plan, it doesn't change the current method of appealing decisions from the NPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2076)|
| 0:34:37| We're going to move along, but two more comments to Councilman DelVal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| I want to be sure that Mr. Briggs' question is answered with a footnote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2081)|
| 0:34:48| that is clear in the Tennessee statute, which I have in front of me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| TCA 13-3304-B, the new B that's effective July 1, 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2092)|
| 0:34:59| says if the legislative body adopts the general regional plan in the form of an ordinance or a resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2099)|
| 0:35:07| then any land use decisions thereafter made by the legislative body, the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2107)|
| 0:35:14| the board of zoning appeals, and I'll skip some words, must be consistent with the general regional plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2114)|
| 0:35:19| So if the plan has a requirement as opposed to a fuzzy section, then you have to abide by the requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2119)|
| 0:35:28| Where you appeal it to a court or whatever is fine, but the standard is in the state statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| which empowers all of us to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2134)|
| 0:35:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2136)|
| 0:35:38| I wouldn't disagree with the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| What's meant by fuzzy section of the plan or recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2140)|
| 0:35:44| whether it's a mandatory part of the recommendation or a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| that depends on the language of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| And I agree that land use decisions that are made after the adoption of the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| must be consistent with the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2157)|
| 0:36:00| But I reiterate there are several layers of administrative review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| and appeal to the city council or the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| before that specific portion of the plan will be interpreted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| and whether the decision is consistent with the plan or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2171)|
| 0:36:16| There's a level of interpretation there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| So if you're talking to a guy from Texas, which means I'm not that bright, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| So what I hear you saying is any, because Councilman DelVolpe read it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| but what I hear you saying, any can be appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2188)|
| 0:36:31| Now, whether they're to the elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| Now, whether they change it or do whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| they still have to be consistent with the plan, but the appeal is allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2197)|
| 0:36:41| I'm not taking away the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| I'm just saying it's the standard in the statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| I want to make sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| The plan is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| Then there are land use decisions that would be based on the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| that are made after the plan that must be consistent with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2216)|
| 0:36:57| Those decisions can be appealed through the administrative process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| and eventually and ultimately to the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2222)|
| 0:37:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2223)|
| 0:37:04| One more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2224)|
| 0:37:05| Councilman Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2225)|
| 0:37:06| I just have some question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2226)|
| 0:37:07| What we are looking at here, the current plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| is this applying to both county and city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| The general plan, I believe, applies to both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2237)|
| 0:37:18| Real quick, I'm going to move through because we'll talk more about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| but also see that at the 25% to 40% range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| residential uses are at one dwelling for two acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2243)|
| 0:37:30| That doesn't change at residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| At 40% to 50% is a residential low-density change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| Residential uses up to one dwelling for two acres is allowed currently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2255)|
| 0:37:40| and now it's proposed it's one dwelling for four acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| And over 50% residential uses one dwelling for two acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| and proposes no development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| And I believe Ridgetop has to be through a specific plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| We don't have that listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| We'll talk about Ridgetop later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| So that's the basics of that particular understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2277)|
| 0:38:03| As you can tell in this conversation, it just goes all kinds of directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2283)|
| 0:38:11| Question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| Who am I asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2293)|
| 0:38:14| Under slopes over 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| I mean, I know this is just the synopsis version of these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2298)|
| 0:38:25| But if it says no development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2305)|
| 0:38:28| it should also be stated that there is possible under special circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2308)|
| 0:38:36| or special district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| Is that in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| On slopes over 50%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| I believe everybody on the task force, regardless of their bent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| agreed that there ought not to be any development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2329)|
| 0:38:52| And what that recommendation is saying is that when we prepare that budget of density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2332)|
| 0:38:59| in making our recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| we are going to give no credit for that portion of the property over 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2340)|
| 0:39:06| Would you consider a driveway up to my flat-top mountain development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2346)|
| 0:39:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2351)|
| 0:39:13| If that's the only way to reach a flat spot on your property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2353)|
| 0:39:18| then we have proposed in the plan smaller right-of-ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2358)|
| 0:39:23| and smaller street profiles to accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2363)|
| 0:39:27| My understanding was there would be a special district for that type of situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2367)|
| 0:39:32| where you call it a hilltop district or something or other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| There was supposed to be a special district set up for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| I mean, it had very serious and controlling rules and limitations, but it's not impossible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2380)|
| 0:39:48| Well, if you're speaking about development on top of the ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2388)|
| 0:39:52| which would be probably a flat spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2392)|
| 0:39:55| but accessible only through a steeply sloped portion of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2395)|
| 0:40:02| we would, through the use of the planned residential zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2402)|
| 0:40:07| and the development plan approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| try to cite the development on the flat part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2410)|
| 0:40:13| and minimize the disturbance to the steeply sloped portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2413)|
| 0:40:18| Would it be able to build this driveway up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2418)|
| 0:40:20| Yeah. If that's the only way to access that flat spot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2420)|
| 0:40:24| then that's the way you do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2424)|
| 0:40:29| So, real quickly, let's talk a few minutes about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| When you see that slope, what is it you like about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| That's all we're going to talk about right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| What is it you like about that plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| What are you supportive of within this that we need to be thinking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| You're talking density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2446)|
| 0:40:48| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| Density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| Well, slope and density, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| We're talking about the slope and density relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| What do you like about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2454)|
| 0:40:59| The slope part?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2459)|
| 0:41:00| The slope-density relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| Well, there's no change except for the last one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| It's similar except very few changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2466)|
| 0:41:14| There are a few changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2474)|
| 0:41:17| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2477)|
| 0:41:18| We'll come to changes in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| Do you want to add on something in support of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2485)|
| 0:41:26| So, what else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2486)|
| 0:41:27| That's pretty much what you like about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| There's very few changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| Anything else you want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| It looks and feels a lot like what we've got already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| We've noted that there's flexibility within the plan that will allow for circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2496)|
| 0:41:44| special circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| So, if you have special circumstances that can be built into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2512)|
| 0:41:58| There's a gradation of the amount of units that are allowed to slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| The more density being allowed at the lower slopes and less at the higher ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2522)|
| 0:42:09| And you like the idea of the density being further down the mountain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| I think it's sensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| That seems sensible to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| Anything else about this slope-density relationship that you want to bring forward to support it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2539)|
| 0:42:26| This really is sort of what Tony said about flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| There's an appeals process for all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2554)|
| 0:42:42| Anyone else want to add to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| So, it sounds like coming in, you are fairly consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| It looks and feels a whole lot like what we've already got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| There are some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| But within those changes, some of you say you like the flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| You like the ability to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2576)|
| 0:42:58| And at least one of you or some of you like the idea of the density being pushed down to the flatter parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2578)|
| 0:43:05| And there's gradation going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| Whereas, in the current plan, there's only two gradations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2587)|
| 0:43:11| There's below a certain point and above a certain point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| And you like the gradation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| Anything else you want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| Make sure we kind of get those on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2603)|
| 0:43:30| Well, let's talk about what concerns you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| Some of that's come up already, but I want you to restate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| And restate it as succinctly as you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2614)|
| 0:43:37| What is it about this slope-density relationship that concerns you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2621)|
| 0:43:43| Basically, it's sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| But there is this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2625)|
| 0:43:47| It's possible with good engineering to come up with a plan that doesn't fit that mold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2627)|
| 0:43:53| I don't know if there's that much flexibility in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2633)|
| 0:43:56| So, for example, if the criteria were specified, you know, with some precision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2636)|
| 0:44:03| what you had to achieve in terms of you could only clear so much of the trees or you could only do certain things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2643)|
| 0:44:09| you might come up with a density that's higher or more intense than this and yet still be acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| But I don't see that as really allowed under here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2654)|
| 0:44:18| So some of the flexibility may be taken out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2658)|
| 0:44:22| In other words, good engineering could come up with a different perspective than the rigid rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2662)|
| 0:44:27| What I hear you saying is you understand flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| You have questions about how flexible it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2672)|
| 0:44:33| I don't want to say something you're not saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2673)|
| 0:44:34| That would be the concern here, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| Is it flexible enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2676)|
| 0:44:37| If someone comes in and they engineer something really well and it makes sense but it violates the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2677)|
| 0:44:43| They engineer it and they have low profile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2683)|
| 0:44:45| You can't see it under ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| They run the roads with the contour of the hill and not against them so there's less runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| They've used materials that blend in and look like the forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2693)|
| 0:44:57| They're in greens and tans and whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| They've done the things that minimize the impact and yet it would seem to me that the density is absolute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2700)|
| 0:45:08| that you really can't propose that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| You might as well just scratch it because you're not going to get anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| You have some loss of flexibility as a trade-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| You're asking about your concern about just enough flexibility for good engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2720)|
| 0:45:21| Any other concerns about this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| Every piece of property is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| What do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2727)|
| 0:45:28| Can you expand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2728)|
| 0:45:29| Help me understand that a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| I don't think one plan fits all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| Every piece of property is uniquely different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2733)|
| 0:45:38| Your concern is that this doesn't address that variety of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| That's where you need that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2746)|
| 0:45:55| Mark, are you wanting to say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| Oh, come on up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| The plan addresses that flexibility in a couple of ways in that it provides for density bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2761)|
| 0:46:08| It recommends the provision of density bonuses for certain performances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| particularly the setting aside of land in undisturbed condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2774)|
| 0:46:19| and then also making it accessible to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| In the case that Nick was describing, if someone had a plan such as that in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2783)|
| 0:46:31| and came in for a rezoning request with the plan in hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2791)|
| 0:46:37| and it met all of the land use plan criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2797)|
| 0:46:42| I suspect that there would be a good chance of getting the zoning approved to make that plan happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2802)|
| 0:46:50| Currently, with planned development zones,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| it's done in a two-step process where they simply get the zone district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| and we provide the maximum density in step one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| and then the development plan comes at a much later time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| If someone had a plan in hand when they made the rezoning request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2828)|
| 0:47:13| and it performed like Nick was describing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2833)|
| 0:47:18| I would say that the chances of getting that rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2838)|
| 0:47:21| as long as it was consistent with the land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| which is either ag and rural residential for most of the hillside and ridgetop protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2845)|
| 0:47:31| one unit to the acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2851)|
| 0:47:33| or with the planned growth and low-density residential standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2853)|
| 0:47:40| What I hear you saying is you guys would look at having flexibility in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| We'll talk about this more in a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| so that they still have the right to appeal to the body also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| I'll call back in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| They have the right to provide us more information on the front end than is conventionally done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| Any other concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| I want to mention one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| We got a letter from the attorney from the Chamber of Commerce, Tom McFall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| This is a big question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| Is the plan legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| Just a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| You probably saw the letter, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| We are reviewing the letter and the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| There aren't any parts of the plan that jump out as being void or extremely vague,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2902)|
| 0:48:29| so we're reviewing the plan and notify you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| At this point from the conversation I had with Joe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2913)|
| 0:48:37| his response to me, and I'm doing this as hearsay only, so I've got to be careful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| that he didn't say anything per se that was illegal about that document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| but you guys would review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2926)|
| 0:48:47| That is my sense as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| In the law department's defense, they did not get a copy of that until about 2.30 this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2929)|
| 0:48:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2934)|
| 0:48:55| You guys are going to look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2935)|
| 0:48:57| and then issue an opinion for the members of the Counseling Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2941)|
| 0:49:03| I'll defer to my law director on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2943)|
| 0:49:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2946)|
| 0:49:07| Well, that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2947)|
| 0:49:09| I have a question along those same lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2949)|
| 0:49:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2951)|
| 0:49:12| We're still talking about slope and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| Well, I'm wanting to maybe amplify the concern in that, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2954)|
| 0:49:22| did you say that that's the answer to that concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| Because I'd like to address that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| The answer about it being illegal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2967)|
| 0:49:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2969)|
| 0:49:30| They hadn't seen, from what I understand in terms of hearsay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| they hadn't seen anything that jumps out as illegal per se, but they're reviewing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2974)|
| 0:49:38| and I'm sure they're going to get back with you with their opinion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2978)|
| 0:49:41| Is that where you're standing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2981)|
| 0:49:43| From what I can see, the memo raised three or four issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2983)|
| 0:49:48| One was the argument that this is too vague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| You can't tell if it reasonably applies to a particular piece of property or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2993)|
| 0:49:59| Another was there hasn't been proper due process in enacting or adopting the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=2999)|
| 0:50:06| Unfortunately, the plan hasn't been adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3006)|
| 0:50:08| It's not binding on the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3008)|
| 0:50:10| So there's more process to be gone through before the plan is operative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| And there were a couple of other concerns that were similar to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| But just to reiterate, nothing jumps out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3020)|
| 0:50:24| So we're not going to issue, you know, make a stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| They're not going to defer that to legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| They can get back with you as quickly as possible on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3033)|
| 0:50:34| So, you know, and I tend to agree with his general comments as it relates to this, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3034)|
| 0:50:41| being not a huge deal, but I guess I would like for if the law director issues a statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3041)|
| 0:50:49| that that's somehow vetted through the state or someone like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3049)|
| 0:50:55| I'll let you guys manage that process from the law director's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3055)|
| 0:50:58| We're going to try to stay on task with this, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3058)|
| 0:51:00| This is what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| Just as a matter of clarification of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| We need to make it quick, though, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3072)|
| 0:51:13| Real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| We sent the letter to the city law director, the county law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| and the city council law director a month ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| We sent it to you guys when we saw on the agenda that you were going to discuss legalities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3080)|
| 0:51:29| and McAdams was going to be out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| So, we sent it to you as an advisory, but both law departments have had it for a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3091)|
| 0:51:37| That we didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3097)|
| 0:51:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3098)|
| 0:51:39| So, you guys will look at that and get back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3099)|
| 0:51:42| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3102)|
| 0:51:43| Back to this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3103)|
| 0:51:44| It's an important discussion, but I think that's going to be handled out of legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3104)|
| 0:51:48| and brought back to us rather than discussing it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| Any other right here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3113)|
| 0:51:54| Any other concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3114)|
| 0:51:56| I want to make sure they're there, vetted in terms of the slope and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3116)|
| 0:52:14| With this in mind, we need to talk about where we are with this, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3134)|
| 0:52:20| I mean, there's really about two or three options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| One is, this is so much like what we've got that everybody in general feels like this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3144)|
| 0:52:31| And that's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| Or the other is, this is so awful that we don't want to even chase the slope density discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| Or the third may be, what are areas that perhaps we could be more flexible on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3159)|
| 0:52:44| And I guess my question I want to ask right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| are there areas that you'd like to see more flexibility within this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3166)|
| 0:52:51| I'm not saying we're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3171)|
| 0:52:52| I'm just saying I'm wondering if it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3172)|
| 0:52:53| Are there areas you felt like there ought to be more flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| or ought to be some kind of amendment or addressing to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3176)|
| 0:53:02| When you were talking with people yesterday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3182)|
| 0:53:04| was there any concern over the fact there was no development on slopes over 50%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| What would be your recommendation with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3194)|
| 0:53:17| I don't have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| I was just asking if that was a concern that was brought up in any of your meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| if anyone had used that as a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| They did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| Within my meetings, that was not brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3205)|
| 0:53:27| There was a question definition of ridgetop, which we can talk about later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| But that particular one wasn't brought up to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3210)|
| 0:53:34| I think one of the concerns that's been brought up to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| and it's not from the development people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3216)|
| 0:53:39| it's more from the private citizens about the over 50%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| being it's their land and now they can't build anything on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3223)|
| 0:53:47| So that's the concern that they brought to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| Do you guys see any...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| Is there any interest in...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| Let's talk about that particular one, the 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3238)|
| 0:54:03| Is there interest in this room of allowing development over 50% in Hawaii?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| In certain circumstances, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3251)|
| 0:54:12| You're saying...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| Say it to me real clear, because like I said, I don't listen real well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| Well, as Councilman Bailey pointed out earlier, each piece of land is different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3257)|
| 0:54:22| and that's why we need flexibility in all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| But just tell somebody that they've got 50% land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| that they cannot ever put anything on to me would be totally wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3268)|
| 0:54:33| But there are special instances where things could be done there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| but it needs to be done with special criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| or that it protects not only them but the ones below them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| Mark, I'm going to come back to you in a second, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3286)|
| 0:54:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3293)|
| 0:54:54| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3294)|
| 0:54:55| So you're saying you understand that if somebody wants to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| under special circumstances with specific criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| there should be a way for them to build at that level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3301)|
| 0:55:03| that you would like to see that kind of flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| But the reason my light is on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| Not to limit that strictly to the 50%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| but there are cases in a couple, you know, between 25 and 40, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3313)|
| 0:55:18| or maybe even 15 to 25 that, I mean, I know that's taken care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| with some of the move my units down and put them here, there, and the other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| but there are still certain circumstances where that, as Nick mentioned a while ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3326)|
| 0:55:31| if a plan comes in that it is, you know, a super-duper plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| and it takes all these things into consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3335)|
| 0:55:39| then they should be allowed to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3339)|
| 0:55:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3341)|
| 0:55:42| And so what I want to summarize and make sure I'm right on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3342)|
| 0:55:48| at this point now, Mark, I'm going to have you come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3348)|
| 0:55:50| I'm going to ask you a specific question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| So he comes back and he says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3352)|
| 0:55:53| we want to make sure that if they want to build certain things at certain levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| there's a process with criteria that they can follow that can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| Is that capable of doing that in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| or does that need to be amended to the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3367)|
| 0:56:12| The recommendation in the plan is to assign certain densities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| to rezoning cases based on that formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| So if somebody has property that's 20% sloped over 50% on that 20%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| they would get zero credits towards their budget of density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| That doesn't mean that they can't develop the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| That flexibility would come at the time of the development plan process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| where we would look at where those units ought to be sited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| those units that are allowed under the density calculations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| where they ought to be sited on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| and how do you go about minimizing the disturbance to the natural landforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3411)|
| 0:56:58| The table probably could have been written more clearly to say that these are criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3418)|
| 0:57:07| or factors in calculating a density factor or a density credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3427)|
| 0:57:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3434)|
| 0:57:15| See, that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3435)|
| 0:57:16| It's written rigidly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| And if people understand that you're saying now is there is some flexibility in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3438)|
| 0:57:23| that takes away a lot of the heartburn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3443)|
| 0:57:27| So what I hear you saying is you would like to see some clarity about that flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3452)|
| 0:57:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3453)|
| 0:57:34| Interesting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| So right now I come back and I hear only two things, basically, in flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| See some flexibility in terms of special circumstance, special criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3460)|
| 0:57:45| and some clarity about how that's described within language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| so people understand it doesn't seem so rigid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| Those seem to be the areas of flexibility someone would like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3473)|

| 0:57:55| Just to expand on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3475)|
| 0:57:58| I mean, if you look at this as a private citizen, not as a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| but as a private citizen, 50% of your land, if we're looking at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3482)|
| 0:58:09| the slope at 50% or above, and say it's 50% of your land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3489)|
| 0:58:12| you've devalued that property by saying they cannot build on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3497)|
| 0:58:18| A lot of loans on mortgages and stuff are based on property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3498)|
| 0:58:24| And if that goes down, then they're going to have to readjust loans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3504)|
| 0:58:28| or may or may not have to, but they're going to have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| By saying that they can't develop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3512)|
| 0:58:35| I would like to see that it doesn't say no development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3515)|
| 0:58:39| that it says maybe case by case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| or more specific than just special circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3522)|
| 0:58:47| Because if not, we're going to have a lot of appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| being come across every single month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| So you're saying you would like to see, within the document itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3532)|
| 0:58:56| specificity about development at 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3536)|
| 0:59:00| That's what scares people now because it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3543)|
| 0:59:04| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3544)|
| 0:59:05| So anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| We're just looking at areas where people like to see some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3546)|
| 0:59:09| Anybody else want to add to this particular document?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3549)|
| 0:59:18| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3558)|
| 0:59:19| Are you ready to move on to the discussion of clearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| I want you to leave here having a more clear understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| of the slope and density issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| Everybody feel like they understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3567)|
| 0:59:29| Where we were, where we are, and what the key issues are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3569)|
| 0:59:34| and areas that you may need to find some ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3574)|
| 0:59:36| whether you want to address those flexibility or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3576)|
| 0:59:40| We good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3580)|
| 0:59:42| Either I'm doing really good or really bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3582)|
| 0:59:45| I was just going to say these points that Commissioner Oneby| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| and Brown and Bailey made, I understand these points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| And I think in certain instances you have a developer that comes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| and he's creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3596)|
| 0:59:58| Now we have GIS technology where you can read land better than you used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| And there might be some instances where, with a particular approach,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3604)|
| 1:00:09| this should be flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| And I understand the concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| And if they could find language that would put that in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3614)|
| 1:00:16| but still keep the general plan, you understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| And to reiterate, I think we have technology now that might actually be used as a tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3620)|
| 1:00:26| for developers who want to build in places that normally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3626)|
| 1:00:31| just looking at the old way of looking at it, you say, well, you can't build there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| But there's a possibility that now we have technology that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| you know, at first blush it looks like we couldn't build there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| But we can use this now to where actually we know you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| You guys are coming to some pretty good points, coming to a good spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3647)|
| 1:00:50| Anybody else understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3650)|
| 1:00:52| You're clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3652)|
| 1:00:54| We can move on to the degrading, clearing, and density discussion from here, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3654)|
| 1:01:01| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| Susan, can you help me for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| Would you take these and put these on the wall over here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3663)|

| 1:01:22| Come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3682)|
| 1:01:23| Help me out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| No, you don't want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3684)|
| 1:01:54| If you'll turn to page one, I guess, or page four, it's in purple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3714)|
| 1:02:05| No, let me get it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| Page one in pink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3728)|
| 1:02:19| Now, you'll notice in the back, the Planning Commission did a more in-depth analysis of both slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3739)|
| 1:02:28| and also clearing that they were able to get out this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| They put that in your packet for additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| But this is a summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3754)|
| 1:02:35| This is how I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| Based on discussions with different people, I'm sure that others can help clarify it as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| Number one, current clearing and grading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| The city and county engineering departments issued the permits for clearing and grading in the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3765)|
| 1:02:49| and county, respectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| The city has a provision of saving six trees per acre, but the code goes on to allow complete clearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| if topography and other constraints pose difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| In that case, eight new trees require to be planted per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| All the city falls under this provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3785)|
| 1:03:08| The county has neither conservation nor planning provisions except for preserving a buffer next to streams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3788)|
| 1:03:14| The proposed clearing and grading plan, the Hillside Plan recommends a generalized clearing formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3794)|
| 1:03:20| which you can see at the bottom, which is up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| The concept is the formula we'd use to make a recommendation in rezoning cases for the amount of clearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| on Hillside only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3809)|
| 1:03:31| If a party with an interest in developing the land believes the formula would be inappropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3811)|
| 1:03:35| the Planning Commission or appropriate legislative body could alter the clearing recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3815)|
| 1:03:40| When a recommendation is made to limit clearing, the NPC staff would have to take into account during the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3820)|
| 1:03:45| plan and concept plan review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| The site plan concept plan is required before subdividing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| The site plan would include areas of provisions for non-disturbance in similar proportion to that which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| approved by the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3837)|
| 1:03:59| In the city, the Planning Commission could alter the non-disturbance areas, could the city council and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3839)|
| 1:04:06| the Planning Commission, the County Commission, as well as the Board of Zoning Appeals could alter the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3846)|
| 1:04:10| non-disturbance area if the site plan is appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3850)|
| 1:04:14| All right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| With that, in terms of clearing, at zero, you see it up there, zero to 15 percent, 100 percent clearing is allowed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3856)|
| 1:04:27| 15 to 25 percent, 50 percent clearing is allowed, and here's where I need some clarification from two things I've read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3867)|
| 1:04:35| Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| I need you to step up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3876)|
| 1:04:37| This is what I pulled off the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3877)|
| 1:04:38| Is this accurate or is there a point where no clearing is allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| But you see the 15 to, 100 percent, zero to 15, 15 to 25 at 50, 25 to 40, and this is off the plan, 10 percent at 40 to 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3882)|
| 1:04:53| 50 plus, no development, and then ridge top, there'd actually have to be a specific site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3893)|
| 1:04:57| Is that accurate or is there anything else you need to add to that to clarify it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3897)|
| 1:05:03| It's accurate and its intent, again, probably could have been written differently in that the intent is for this to be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3903)|
| 1:05:15| much the same way that we use the density factors, whereby with slope and density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3915)|
| 1:05:22| we're applying those at the rezoning stage with clearing and grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| and these factors we would be applying at the development plan and concept plan stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| Second stage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3931)|
| 1:05:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3932)|
| 1:05:33| Step two of zoning and step one of subdivision regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| Same plan, two different names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| Development plan is associated with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| Concept plan is associated with subdividing, but they are literally the same plan in most cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3942)|
| 1:05:51| And we would prepare an overall budget, again, based on these factors and apply it to the plan that's proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3951)|
| 1:05:59| and ultimately approved by the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3959)|
| 1:06:05| There is, again, that same appeal process in the city to the city council, in the county to the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| on development plan approval decisions by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| But it doesn't necessarily say that on every chunk of a parcel that is over 40 percent or over 50 percent, you can't clear trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3975)|
| 1:06:26| It simply says that when we prepare an overall budget, we're going to give no credit for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3986)|
| 1:06:32| or we're going to give credit for all of the trees that exist on that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3992)|
| 1:06:37| And tell me, like I said, I learn slow, the reason for the percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=3997)|
| 1:06:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4007)|
| 1:06:48| The general policy is that the steeper the slope, the more we want to leave it undisturbed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4008)|
| 1:06:52| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| Primarily to minimize the amount of water runoff and erosion that can result from clearing steeply sloped lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4014)|
| 1:07:08| All the science points to starting those kinds of considerations at 15 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| and as the slopes increase to minimize the amount of disturbance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4033)|
| 1:07:19| So that formula is calibrated that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4044)|
| 1:07:26| Is there someone here from the soiler side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4046)|
| 1:07:31| Might have had, may have left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4051)|
| 1:07:34| Could you step up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4054)|
| 1:07:37| Before you get there, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4057)|
| 1:07:39| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4059)|
| 1:07:40| I'm sorry, I didn't see you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4060)|
| 1:07:41| Mark was saying something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4061)|
| 1:07:42| Step back, I'll pause it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| We'll let them finish this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4063)|
| 1:07:44| I wasn't sure that I got it because it matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| Mark was saying that the 15 percent, I think the 50 percent, who's going to quarrel with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4067)|
| 1:07:52| But the 15 percent and the 10 percent clearing limitations, were you saying those are not absolutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4072)|
| 1:07:59| but they go to whether or not you get a credit for bonuses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4079)|
| 1:08:02| Because there's a real difference about how much you clear, and we hear lots of complaints about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4082)|
| 1:08:07| I might have to clear a wider road than 24 feet to build it, I mean, in order to get my equipment in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4087)|
| 1:08:13| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4093)|
| 1:08:14| So what is the clearing percentage limitation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4094)|
| 1:08:18| What does it mean again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| Let me see if I can explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| It's used the same way that we use the density factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| in that the numbers are used to prepare an overall budget for clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4104)|
| 1:08:30| So you could end up with a parcel that says that you can clear 73 percent of that total parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4110)|
| 1:08:39| So we would then look to find the places where we can save 27 percent of that parcel in an undisturbed case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4119)|
| 1:08:49| and we would look first to the most deeply sloped areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4129)|
| 1:08:52| But you could have a case where next to a stream where we have a requirement that if you have trees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4132)|
| 1:08:59| you need to save them for 75 feet, but we're going to give you credit for taking 100 percent of that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4139)|
| 1:09:07| if it's below 15 percent slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| What if I've got this 10 acres and it's in this 25 to 40 percent range?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4150)|
| 1:09:15| Am I limited to a total amount of area clearing of 15 percent in terms of literally the percentage of the landmass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4155)|
| 1:09:24| or is that only for calculating whether I get a zero bonus or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4164)|
| 1:09:29| In other words, how restrictive is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| He's wanting to know how restrictive that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| If, for example, your parcel was entirely within one range and it was 15 to 25 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| you would be allowed to clear 50 percent of the total parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4181)|
| 1:09:46| Right, and I'm saying that one's not very controversial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4186)|
| 1:09:48| When you get down to 15 or 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| The 25 and up is what I think he's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| The data indicates that there is, I think it's like 8,000 acres of the 130 are sloped 50 percent or more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4193)|
| 1:10:05| so it's a relatively small proportion of the total area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4205)|
| 1:10:09| Don't go to 50 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| It's the middle range there that has the most land in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4211)|
| 1:10:14| We're looking at the 25 to 40 percent has 25 percent of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| and 40 to 50 has seven and a quarter, so you're talking about 32 percent of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| Are you limited to that percentage, or is that only for calculating a zero bonus because you did, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4224)|
| 1:10:31| you cleared 18 percent and not 15 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4231)|
| 1:10:34| There are no recommendations for bonuses based on clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4234)|
| 1:10:40| No, it's an absolute limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| You cannot clear as a percentage of the land, 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4242)|
| 1:10:46| That's the recommended budget going in, and certainly through the development plan approval process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4246)|
| 1:10:53| we all acknowledge that, okay, the formula says 68 percent, but you're coming in at 70,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4253)|
| 1:11:00| and you've done the best job that you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4260)|
| 1:11:03| So help me understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4263)|
| 1:11:04| This is how I describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| I want to make sure that I understand it, and then maybe the councilman can help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4265)|
| 1:11:10| It will help him a little bit too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4270)|
| 1:11:12| So you're saying those aren't credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| That's fairly absolute coming in on the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| You may repeal it, and there may be other plans you can make changes on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| but if you're developing land and all the land is between 25 percent and 40 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4282)|
| 1:11:30| then you can clear 15 percent of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| That's the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| That's the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4294)|
| 1:11:35| Now, there can be appeals, and there can be special circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4295)|
| 1:11:37| but that's not written as a highly flexible model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| That's the recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| Just keep in mind that if your parcel is entirely between 25 and 40 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4303)|
| 1:11:49| you're going to have half a unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4309)|
| 1:11:56| So you're going to have two-acre minimum lots, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| And with 8,000 to 10,000 square feet in a lot, you can find a buildable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4320)|
| 1:12:08| So coming back to that, councilman, did you get your question answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| Yeah, but I'm picturing if I have a subdivision or I'm developing it, I've got a road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4331)|
| 1:12:16| I've got a parcel where I've got to put the house footprint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| the fire codes want me to clear a little bit outside of the reaches of the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| so you can get around it and put out a fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| I'm just trying to figure out whether that's a reasonable amount is what I'm hearing you say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| Is it too small is what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4350)|
| 1:12:32| So what I hear you saying, I want to make sure I understand you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| is you're concerned about is 15 percent a reasonable amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| and you were asking how much flexibility was tied into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4358)|
| 1:12:41| Is that what I heard you ask?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4361)|
| 1:12:42| We were given an example at one of the workshops where MPC appeared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4362)|
| 1:12:47| where they showed a piece of land that had a combination turf, flatland and a hillside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4367)|
| 1:12:52| and, of course, the goal was to direct more of the development and denser development down low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4372)|
| 1:12:57| But if you have essentially a steep piece of land, is the absolute limit 15 percent when you're in the 25 to 40?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4377)|
| 1:13:04| So when we come back to concerns, that needs to be something we make sure we put up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4384)|
| 1:13:07| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4387)|
| 1:13:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| One question real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| Come back here to the science guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| In terms of stormwater runoff, what do we need to know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4393)|
| 1:13:19| We're talking about clearing and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| What are one or two things or some specific things we need to know about stormwater runoff that will affect this, if anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4402)|
| 1:13:31| Well, in terms of stormwater runoff, you're regulated already by virtue of EPA through the MPDS permit that Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4411)|
| 1:13:47| and the city of Knoxville has to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4427)|
| 1:13:50| You know, that's pertaining to one inch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| and there are regulations already that you have to control the runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4433)|
| 1:14:00| The best way that I could think to illustrate what happens in the natural versus developed scenario is to give you the diagram| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4440)|
| 1:14:13| that all of you all have seen that shows the difference in the amount of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4453)|
| 1:14:17| This one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4457)|
| 1:14:19| Yes, that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4459)|
| 1:14:21| How you change the amount of evapotranspiration, infiltration, and runoff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4461)|
| 1:14:26| whenever you go from a natural setting to a disturbed setting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4466)|
| 1:14:31| and a lot of that is due to soil compaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| Water doesn't infiltrate compacted soil, so it changes it drastically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4474)|
| 1:14:40| and obviously with a steeper slope, your erosion potential is much greater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4480)|
| 1:14:44| and your ability to be able to retain that first inch is much harder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4484)|
| 1:14:52| What David was suggesting is exactly what I was looking at as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| And also, when you remove much of the vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| and you remove much of the root system that is holding that soil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4502)|
| 1:15:07| your energy level of the water goes up greatly as the slope increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| So, removing more vegetation at higher slopes will increase erosion and also increase runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4511)|
| 1:15:19| When you're looking at runoff potential once land is cleared and denuded of vegetation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4519)|
| 1:15:26| it goes up about five-fold from what it would be in a natural state in trees and other vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4526)|
| 1:15:33| because rainfall energy is impacted greatly by hitting the canopy of whatever plants are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4533)|
| 1:15:41| slowing it down, and making it much less erosive and much less viable for runoff as it is falling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4541)|
| 1:15:52| I'm sorry. Go ahead. I didn't mean to interrupt you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| No, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4555)|
| 1:15:56| And so, what I hear you say basically is the things that we need to be aware of here is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4556)|
| 1:16:02| number one, there is an EPA standard, and was I correct when I said one inch to the first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4562)|
| 1:16:06| Could you kind of clarify that standard real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| The one-inch rule is a fairly new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4570)|
| 1:16:13| It was issued in phase two of the NPDES regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4573)|
| 1:16:19| So, that originates with EPA, who passes it to TDEC in our state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4579)|
| 1:16:24| and then TDEC sends it to the local governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4584)|
| 1:16:28| And regardless of this plan, all that's enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4588)|
| 1:16:33| Knox County and City of Knoxville have to enforce stormwater ordinances right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4593)|
| 1:16:38| And there's no choice on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| But how a developer handles the land greatly impacts whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4601)|
| 1:16:46| or not they can be in compliance with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| Hey, Steve, if we could ask any of the speakers to just give their name for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4609)|
| 1:16:54| All right. Could you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4614)|
| 1:16:55| And any affiliation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4615)|

| 1:17:12| I'm an agronomist and horticulturist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| Any questions of these guys beforehand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4636)|
| 1:17:18| Of course, they'll still be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4638)|
| 1:17:21| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4641)|
| 1:17:23| Thank you, Steve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4643)|
| 1:17:24| I was wondering if David or Neil would apply some of what they just said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4644)|
| 1:17:30| to the specific questions that Nick had about the 25 to 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4650)|
| 1:17:38| And by that, I mean when I think from conversations that we've had on the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4658)|
| 1:17:45| with developers, they're very adverse to going in to places like 25 to 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4665)|
| 1:17:53| They're very vocal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| Those are not desirable places for reasons that you all just mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4677)|
| 1:18:03| You just can't do it with economy and any carefulness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4683)|
| 1:18:09| But I was just wondering if you all had any comments relative to what Nick was concerned with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4689)|
| 1:18:14| about a site that was primarily, if not all, within a 25 to 40 percent range.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4694)|
| 1:18:22| Because just looking at a number like 15 percent clearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4702)|
| 1:18:26| that does seem harsh maybe from a developer standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4706)|
| 1:18:30| But is it reasonable to you all from a soil or agronomy standpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4710)|
| 1:18:35| And keep that from a soil perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4715)|
| 1:18:36| As a soil scientist perspective, is there anything you can add to that discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4716)|
| 1:18:40| That's what we want to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| I think the big thing to keep in mind is look at the amount of land you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4723)|
| 1:18:50| If it's restricted to 15 percent on the 25 to 40 percent slope, but you're talking about two acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4730)|
| 1:18:58| 15 percent of two acres is a good amount of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4738)|
| 1:19:04| I think it would be unreasonable to say that a developer wouldn't have room to develop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4744)|
| 1:19:11| with that amount of land they could disturb on that large a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4751)|
| 1:19:15| But what I want you to focus on is from a soil science perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4755)|
| 1:19:19| is the question he's asking, is the 15 percent kind of in that reasonable range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4759)|
| 1:19:26| or can you not really say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4766)|
| 1:19:28| I mean, what you know is the runoff, but there's not really a formula that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4768)|
| 1:19:32| within a certain amount you can develop this much to manage storm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4772)|
| 1:19:36| I guess that's what I'm looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4776)|
| 1:19:38| I'm looking for simplicity, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4778)|
| 1:19:40| Is there anything that just says, oh yeah, there's this formula and this is how you do it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4780)|
| 1:19:44| There is formulas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4784)|
| 1:19:46| But the problem is, as we in this discussion, I see it's case by case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4786)|
| 1:19:52| because it deals with slope length, with soil type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4792)|
| 1:19:56| with all of those different things that come into play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4796)|
| 1:19:59| and also what the previous use of the land was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4799)|
| 1:20:02| and also how much of the soil has already been eroded in the past by agriculture and other uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4802)|
| 1:20:09| Because most of the land that we're talking about in the 25 to 40 percent range was once farmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4809)|
| 1:20:16| So a lot of the soil has already been lost, and that comes into the equation as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4816)|
| 1:20:21| But 15 percent is a reasonable amount to allow on two acres, two dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4821)|
| 1:20:29| You're going to look at something where you've got three-tenths of an acre to use for the footprint for the movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4829)|
| 1:20:36| or in the placing of landscape, lawn, and a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4836)|
| 1:20:41| So that is going to be a reasonable amount in most situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| However, our slopes here are so small in many cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| Slopes change drastically over small reaches in hundreds, in tens and hundreds of feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4850)|
| 1:20:57| We're talking where in other places we'd be talking thousands of feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4857)|
| 1:21:02| And that can come into play as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4862)|
| 1:21:05| But overall, 15 percent seems pretty reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4865)|
| 1:21:08| So from a soil science perspective, that seems reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4868)|
| 1:21:11| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4871)|
| 1:21:12| We may call on you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4872)|
| 1:21:13| Councilman Della Volpe is coming from a development perspective that that seems restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4873)|
| 1:21:18| So we have those two concepts that are floating around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| Let me add a thought, and that is that they were talking about EPA and Tennessee law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4882)|
| 1:21:27| The Tennessee general construction permit was adopted on May the 23rd, 2011, after this plan was written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4887)|
| 1:21:38| And it is in effect for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| Some things haven't changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4901)|
| 1:21:42| When you come in to develop anything more than one acre, you must file a stormwater pollution prevention plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4902)|
| 1:21:51| that says how you're going to deal with erosion and sediment and siltation and all those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4911)|
| 1:21:56| And it has to be prepared by an engineer, a licensed engineer or a landscape architect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4916)|
| 1:22:01| or someone who's taken the design courses provided by TDEC to enable them to be able to show that they are dealing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4921)|
| 1:22:12| Now, it's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4932)|
| 1:22:13| The more you clear, the more erosion, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4933)|
| 1:22:15| The less trees absorb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4935)|
| 1:22:17| Tree roots hold the world together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| And you take them down, you have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| And the same is true with other vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| But there are buffers in there for if you're near an undamaged stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4942)|
| 1:22:28| You've got to be 60 feet back, no equipment, nothing happens there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4948)|
| 1:22:31| You've got to stay away from the stream bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4951)|
| 1:22:33| So there are rules and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| There are inspection requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| And I guess the question is, this rule seems absolute again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4957)|
| 1:22:43| And Mark was addressing, well, later when you come in with engineering, if you get that far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4963)|
| 1:22:50| perhaps you can show a design that's really intelligent and avoids not using that land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4970)|
| 1:22:58| But I think the 15% clearing is absolute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| I wonder when you add roads in addition to the footprint for the lot and the clearing for fire protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4982)|
| 1:23:09| whether that's a good number or a bad number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4989)|
| 1:23:11| Our neighboring city, Sevierville, uses 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| I don't know whether that's a good number or a bad number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| I'm just saying that's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| You're asking a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| And so what I hear in summary, real quick on this one is, in terms of rainwater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5000)|
| 1:23:23| obviously we know that the more undeveloped land, the less runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5003)|
| 1:23:29| And the question you had is, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5009)|
| 1:23:32| And, by the way, we're held to that already within the current rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5012)|
| 1:23:37| We have ways of dealing with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5017)|
| 1:23:38| It doesn't prevent runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5018)|
| 1:23:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| The rules make you deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| Deal with runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5021)|
| 1:23:42| Here they're saying this is one way to manage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5022)|
| 1:23:45| And you're asking the question, is that reasonable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5025)|
| 1:23:47| It's part of nature's way of managing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5027)|
| 1:23:48| Less clearing is better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5028)|
| 1:23:49| The question is, is it too restrictive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5029)|
| 1:23:51| Is it too restrictive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5031)|
| 1:23:52| That's the question we're asking, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5032)|
| 1:23:54| We can clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5034)|
| 1:23:55| We can move to the next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5035)|
| 1:23:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5036)|
| 1:23:57| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5037)|
| 1:23:58| When you talk about the percentage of land that can be cleared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5038)|
| 1:24:01| how do you take into account land that's already cleared in your development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5041)|
| 1:24:06| Question, real quick, can you answer that one real quick, Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5046)|
| 1:24:09| If land, if you're, I hear you saying it, if I get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5049)|
| 1:24:13| If I'm not clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| And 20 acres are already cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| Does that, how does that affect the clearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5057)|
| 1:24:20| Is that counted into the clearing already?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5060)|
| 1:24:27| The plan makes a recommendation as far as these clearing factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5067)|
| 1:24:34| If that recommendation is then run within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5074)|
| 1:24:37| and an ordinance is created to codify that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| we would have to have some provisions in there for dealing with existing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5081)|
| 1:24:46| But if it's already cleared and your budget exceeds that amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5086)|
| 1:24:53| then we're going to try to direct your development into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| to utilize that cleared space first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5097)|
| 1:24:59| and then eat into the uncleared space as the budget allows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5099)|
| 1:25:05| So you're saying yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| I mean, right now, the way it stands, the cleared space needs to be counted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| You say that maybe there may be some kind of ordinance later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| that may deal with previously cleared land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5114)|
| 1:25:16| But at this point, it is considered part of the clearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5116)|
| 1:25:19| If the already cleared space exceeds your budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5119)|
| 1:25:23| then we would use the limits of the existing cleared space on the development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5123)|
| 1:25:30| Do you hear what he's saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5130)|
| 1:25:32| He says yes, in essence, until it's dealt differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5132)|
| 1:25:35| Yeah, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| See, that's the great thing about not being that bright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5137)|
| 1:25:39| I can say stuff really short, you know, and no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| I mean, we had kind of the same question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5142)|
| 1:25:44| To me, every piece of property is different, and as it stands today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5144)|
| 1:25:49| and it just gets very fuzzy when you get into what's already been cleared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5149)|
| 1:25:54| and what part of the property it's already cleared on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| versus where you would like to develop or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5157)|
| 1:26:00| And so every piece of property is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5160)|
| 1:26:03| Yes, that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5163)|
| 1:26:07| One more comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5167)|
| 1:26:08| Then we're going to move to the support and concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5168)|
| 1:26:10| We're doing the concerns right now, so I want to do it in a more orderly manner here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5174)|
| 1:26:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5175)|
| 1:26:16| So I definitely understand what Councilman Bailey was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5176)|
| 1:26:21| but I guess I'd like an answer maybe from the soil guys or someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5181)|
| 1:26:26| I hadn't seen anyone necessarily argue that Mother Nature's way is that these numbers are accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5186)|
| 1:26:35| And the statement was made, I guess we can do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| is Mother Nature's way too restrictive I think is what I heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5199)|
| 1:26:43| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| I said leaving land in the natural form is Mother Nature's way of dealing with runoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5204)|
| 1:26:49| It's absorbed by the tree roots and grass roots and bushes and shrubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5209)|
| 1:26:53| It's slowed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| It's decelerated, and so it causes less erosion, less siltation, less problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5214)|
| 1:27:00| But, again, you deal with that by engineering as well when you clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| I guess my question, I think what I heard was that these numbers, this proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5225)|
| 1:27:12| embraces Mother Nature's way in a way that we can do as much development as folks deem fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5232)|
| 1:27:19| I guess my comment is, and maybe Nick started to answer it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5239)|
| 1:27:25| I've not seen an engineered way of necessarily dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5245)|
| 1:27:31| I know detentive fines and whatnot, but I'm not for its development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| So I'd like to see something on your paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5254)|
| 1:27:38| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5258)|
| 1:27:39| So what I hear you guys saying, and this is just trying to figure this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5259)|
| 1:27:42| is basically both of you agree that Mother Nature's way is a really efficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| positive way to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| You would say, what I heard you say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5268)|
| 1:27:51| Councilman, was that when you develop you have to engineer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5271)|
| 1:27:54| You have to engineer around the runoff you create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5274)|
| 1:27:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5277)|
| 1:27:58| And they're coming back saying it requires you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5278)|
| 1:28:00| It requires you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5280)|
| 1:28:01| You should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| And they're saying what this does, they're developing a plan that will use more of Mother Nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| to manage that and less of the engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5288)|
| 1:28:10| Is that kind of what I understand you guys saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5290)|
| 1:28:15| In the simplest, remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5296)|
| 1:28:17| We've got to put it in Steve words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5297)|
| 1:28:18| You really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5298)|
| 1:28:19| You have to dumb it down or we don't get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| For example, if you clear a space and you make a driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| and you use pervious bricks that allow water to penetrate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| you have sort of used Mother Nature's way in part, but you have cleared that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5307)|
| 1:28:32| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| You've restored part of it by trying to use the water back into the soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| So kind of moving to the next step, what is it you find supportive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5319)|
| 1:28:43| What do you like about the clearing density discussion here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5323)|
| 1:28:46| What is it you can get behind you feel like is a good thing about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| I think it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| I hadn't heard any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5334)|
| 1:28:57| I wouldn't say anything different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| So when you mean it works, what do you mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5339)|
| 1:29:02| Would you be real specific about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| It meets the law, as the gentleman pointed out to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5344)|
| 1:29:10| It also allows for, and we can argue the point how much, how little,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5350)|
| 1:29:18| but it allows for development while meeting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| and understanding the nature of these slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5362)|
| 1:29:30| So it provides for kind of Mother Nature within the slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| and it allows for at least some development is what I hear you saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5375)|
| 1:29:38| Anybody else, kind of what do you like about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5378)|
| 1:29:47| Anybody want to add anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5387)|
| 1:29:48| We'll make sure and leave anybody out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5388)|
| 1:29:52| Commissioner Burleson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5392)|
| 1:29:54| I'll just second what Sam said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5394)|
| 1:29:55| I think it does allow for development while still providing some necessary protections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5395)|
| 1:30:04| And I think also, like what Nick was saying about the pervious materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5404)|
| 1:30:10| that's an area that's developing really fast with new stuff coming out all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| And I think that those sorts of materials are only going to improve from here on out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| So I'm actually looking forward to seeing what's going to be available next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5421)|
| 1:30:28| in five years and ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| I think that this will only improve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5433)|
| 1:30:34| So you're supporting those two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| Anybody, Commissioner Norman, want to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5437)|
| 1:30:39| This may be a bit of an expansion of the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5439)|
| 1:30:43| I don't see your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| It's not that I'm ignoring you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5445)|
| 1:30:46| I just didn't see your light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| By virtue of what David and Neil just presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| it's consistent with what science tells us about how soils work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5451)|
| 1:30:56| and how problematic erosion is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5456)|
| 1:31:00| and what we need to do as best we can in development practices to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5460)|
| 1:31:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5467)|
| 1:31:08| Anyone else want to add something else to this support?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| Yes, Councilman Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| Yes, quite simply, it's protective of property rights and property values down the hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5472)|
| 1:31:21| You know what this is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| That's a spell check because I misspelled the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5482)|
| 1:31:27| It's the old manual spell check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5487)|
| 1:31:28| Right there, buddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5488)|
| 1:31:30| Protective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5490)|
| 1:31:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5491)|
| 1:31:32| You know, they said never do math and spell in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5492)|
| 1:31:34| That's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| So it's protective of property rights downstream, downhill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5496)|
| 1:31:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5504)|
| 1:31:45| What about concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| Now, here's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5506)|
| 1:31:47| I want to make sure I get this correct from Councilman De La Volpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| He's not sitting there saying 15% is bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| I just don't know if that's too restrictive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| I have concerns about that and the absoluteness of that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5516)|
| 1:32:00| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5520)|
| 1:32:02| I'm saying that and I'm saying that our neighbor to the, what would that be, southeast, which is Sevier County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5522)|
| 1:32:08| has said that, you know, let's use 30% clearing as the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5528)|
| 1:32:13| Let's require that there be a certain amount of tree cover that if you take it out, you replace the trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5533)|
| 1:32:19| And you went in your little listing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| You went where Knoxville, the city, has some place in the county doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5541)|
| 1:32:26| But the idea that you reforest as you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| And so if it's too restrictive, we ought to know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5549)|
| 1:32:33| And I suppose in addition to asking plant scientists, we should ask hydrologists that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| Probably some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5558)|
| 1:32:39| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| Anybody have concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| This is concerns section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| Councilman Thomas, you have a concern?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5564)|
| 1:32:46| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| Under what we said was supportive, we've said it allows a lot of environmental protection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5570)|
| 1:32:56| but it does allow economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5576)|
| 1:32:58| But the concern is, is can that economic development be done economically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5578)|
| 1:33:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5582)|
| 1:33:03| Can the development be done economically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5583)|
| 1:33:05| I don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| I'm just, that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5586)|
| 1:33:14| So you guys see the handwriting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5594)|
| 1:33:15| Don't you wish Phyllis was here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| You could read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5597)|
| 1:33:18| You know, she's putting her kid in college in Oregon, so you got my handwriting instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5598)|
| 1:33:23| Anybody else have concerns?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| What are other concerns you have about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| It's just what I said earlier, that I think that, you know, it gets fuzzy when you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5608)|
| 1:33:35| every piece of property is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| Some have already been cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5617)|
| 1:33:39| Others haven't at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| Where the development would fit versus where the development or the developer would want to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5622)|
| 1:33:49| versus where it's already cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5629)|
| 1:33:51| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| Anyone else want to add to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| So basically, does everybody kind of understand, you know, what we're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5637)|
| 1:34:01| Do you have a good idea of what you're looking at up there in terms of clearing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5641)|
| 1:34:08| And then come back and understand the supportive sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| As you know, it uses Mother Nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| It really does manage erosion and water in a way that's intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5653)|
| 1:34:17| It does a great job of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5657)|
| 1:34:19| There are those who believe that allows for development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5659)|
| 1:34:22| consistent with that kind of protection against erosion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| It gives them, and some would think, plenty of room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| They feel like others would say it also protects the downhill people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5667)|
| 1:34:31| I mean, that people are catching the brunt of that runoff and slides and water and flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5671)|
| 1:34:36| It protects them, and it does all that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5676)|
| 1:34:38| On the other side, you know, concerns are coming back to the councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5678)|
| 1:34:42| You know, how absolute should this number be, and is that too tight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| Do we need to look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5686)|
| 1:34:47| I think Sevier County, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5687)|
| 1:34:48| I think Sevier County's got a 30% type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| You know, and can it be done economically?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5692)|
| 1:34:54| We claim that, but we really don't know if it can be done economically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| And the concern that, you know, can you do this kind of strict numbering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5697)|
| 1:35:03| when properties differ, and how do we manage that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5703)|
| 1:35:07| Any other questions or comments you want to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| before we kind of move on to other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| I just wanted to add to the supportive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5712)|
| 1:35:14| the same thing that we did in the previous discussion about density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5714)|
| 1:35:18| and that is that these are proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| There's still an element of flexibility within these proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| There is the judgment of the staffers and the experts in this field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| that are going to make decisions about where and how.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5733)|
| 1:35:38| And so I consider it still that an aspect of the supportive side of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5738)|
| 1:35:43| is that it does have flexibility to look at these special landforms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5743)|
| 1:35:48| which we acknowledge that in our county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| We have a varied topography, and the staff knows that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5752)|
| 1:35:58| and I think they've built that into this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| So what I understand you saying, what I understand the process says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| you can come in and you can have these, but you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| If someone comes in, the MPC can look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| They can make adjustments based upon proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5770)|
| 1:36:12| If they're unhappy with that, they can come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5772)|
| 1:36:14| and they can appeal to their elected officials about clearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| as well as they can on slope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5777)|
| 1:36:19| and you guys can change that or do whatever you need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5779)|
| 1:36:23| But that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| Anybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| So with that in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5790)|
| 1:36:43| let's talk about kind of the areas where there might be some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5803)|
| 1:36:48| Where are some areas that we could look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5808)|
| 1:36:55| and maybe make some adjustments to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5815)|
| 1:36:58| that might make it more useful in your mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5818)|
| 1:37:02| I'll just go back to the commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5822)|
| 1:37:05| Do you think that needs to be an area, the 50%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| where we might need to look at changing that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| Is that what you think an area of flexibility would be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| The 15% development at the 25%, 40% level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| Again, I don't have the answers because I don't have the technical training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5837)|
| 1:37:22| and probably very few of us have the level of technical training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5842)|
| 1:37:26| in this body or collection of bodies to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5846)|
| 1:37:31| But I have heard the argument made that if you list a long list of criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5851)|
| 1:37:39| that sort of end results you must reach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5859)|
| 1:37:44| but leave the flexibility to the designer to try to achieve them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| you harness that kind of ingenuity and whatnot that we kind of treasure as Americans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5869)|
| 1:37:55| And when you make the requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5875)|
| 1:38:00| come convince me in a planned zone that what you want to do is okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5880)|
| 1:38:06| you take away from me the ability as a businessman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| to prepare a business plan on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| In other words, I've got to take a lot of risks if I'm a developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| and I don't mean to stand here and talk only about developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| because I represent lots of people who are downhill and downstream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| and they're affected by floodwaters and flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| But if you're a developer and you're making a business plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5907)|
| 1:38:31| you want to look at this and say, okay, there's so many acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5911)|
| 1:38:34| Bubba's going to sell it for X dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5914)|
| 1:38:37| I'm going to have to spend this kind of money on engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5917)|
| 1:38:40| on building it out, on loans and interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5920)|
| 1:38:43| And to the extent the criteria are in front of me, I can do my own math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5923)|
| 1:38:48| I might be wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5928)|
| 1:38:49| I might go belly up, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| But I can do my own math and figure out is this something I want to pursue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5931)|
| 1:38:56| If you force me in the alternative to buy it, plan it, engineer it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5936)|
| 1:39:01| and then go see if I can make it work, I don't know if I want to take that risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| So you might be discouraging development because you discourage the kind of business assessment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5945)|
| 1:39:12| that someone would want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5952)|
| 1:39:13| And that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5953)|
| 1:39:14| Yeah, that really fits under concerns, but I appreciate that, Ryan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| Okay, so that's more of a concern, but it's a very articulate one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5957)|
| 1:39:21| And so that's a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5961)|
| 1:39:22| You kind of need to put that one on that concern list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5962)|
| 1:39:25| And we're looking for what are some areas of flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5965)|
| 1:39:28| Are there areas where there could be some flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5968)|
| 1:39:30| areas that you'd like to see maybe some give and take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5970)|
| 1:39:34| Or is this plan exactly what you want, or it's so bad you can't deal with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5974)|
| 1:39:37| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5977)|
| 1:39:44| I have a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5984)|
| 1:39:46| You know, it's not stated explicitly in the plan about some of the avenues of flexibility that are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5986)|
| 1:39:56| You know, we've talked about this again and again, the right to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5996)|
| 1:39:59| You know, it's a plan and some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=5999)|
| 1:40:02| And I don't know if that needs to be written explicitly in there saying, if you do not like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6002)|
| 1:40:09| or if you feel you have this, or there are exceptions, this may be appealed, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6009)|
| 1:40:14| And I think that that may, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6014)|
| 1:40:18| that may leave some of the real heartburn and concerns that we're seeing from the different, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6018)|
| 1:40:27| both the landowners over property rights and the developers over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6027)|
| 1:40:31| because so much of what we heard is that the law doesn't allow this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6031)|
| 1:40:35| It's not going to allow this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6035)|
| 1:40:36| It's not going to allow this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| And I think that was a lot of the misunderstanding that was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| Some of it was true misunderstanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6041)|
| 1:40:43| and some of it was intentional misinformation to, you know, to blur things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6043)|
| 1:40:50| But I think that it's, I think if we put something into the plan is to make it explicit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6050)|
| 1:40:55| make it in black and white, and make it understandable about what the appeals process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6055)|
| 1:41:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| And so I hear what I hear Commissioner Briggs is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6061)|
| 1:41:03| You know, we need to pretty clearly state how that process works if you want flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6063)|
| 1:41:09| And there's an appeals process, the way you can go to do things differently or change the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| and you may have a good idea of why you should develop more than 15 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| and there's a process you can go through to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| What I hear over here on the concern side from the councilman is he has a concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6081)|
| 1:41:27| that that type of percentages will keep people from being creative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6087)|
| 1:41:32| But, you know, he doesn't know for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| A little further down the risk chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| A little further down the risk chain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6097)|
| 1:41:38| Before you make the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| You may have committed resources, dollars at that point rather than paper and ink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6100)|
| 1:41:45| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6105)|
| 1:41:46| Does anybody have anything else that you, is this about flexibility or areas you see flexibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6106)|
| 1:41:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6110)|
| 1:41:51| Oh, no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6111)|
| 1:41:52| Everybody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6112)|
| 1:41:53| I know it's been a long day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6113)|
| 1:41:54| You're dropping like flies, man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6114)|
| 1:41:55| I'm just losing people on the left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6115)|
| 1:41:57| So are we, we can, is there anything else you want to add to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6117)|
| 1:42:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6122)|
| 1:42:07| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| A little tag on what Nick said, which I thought was very, very well articulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6129)|
| 1:42:15| I guess maybe the end of that, though, is, again, because of my circumstances in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6135)|
| 1:42:22| obviously I'm concerned about the people downstream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6142)|
| 1:42:25| And what if you have a developer who's trying to do all this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6145)|
| 1:42:28| and he thinks he's got a good plan, but he's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| And the people downtown suffer from his mistake, no matter how well intentioned he is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6151)|
| 1:42:37| or, you know, what resources he's brought into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6157)|
| 1:42:40| So I guess that's kind of, I understand completely Councilman Della Volpe's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6160)|
| 1:42:45| and it's a very good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6165)|
| 1:42:47| I guess that, I guess, is kind of the concern that kind of evolves out of his point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6167)|
| 1:42:52| And so what I hear you saying is, as we talk about flexibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| there has to be this balance between creativity and good management that you don't end up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6176)|
| 1:43:01| And there's got to be that balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6181)|
| 1:43:07| A couple more comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6187)|
| 1:43:08| We'll kind of tie things up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6188)|
| 1:43:09| I'll go to Commissioner Norm and Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6189)|
| 1:43:13| The same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| It's just extending upon what Charlie just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6194)|
| 1:43:17| It's, you know, what the specialists in the field know is that we have to consider not just a parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6197)|
| 1:43:29| And stormwater managers have a much broader view of this topic of erosion and water issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6209)|
| 1:43:36| And so it's a watershed approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| And I sympathize with a businessman that has a parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6219)|
| 1:43:44| and he's trying to maximize his profit on that parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6224)|
| 1:43:47| but he has that parcel that lives and breathes within a watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6227)|
| 1:43:53| And so as we try to accommodate the property rights of the individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6233)|
| 1:44:00| we've got to respond to the reality of what's going on in this much larger area in terms of water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6240)|
| 1:44:09| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6249)|
| 1:44:10| That's almost what I said when we had our deliberations over this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6250)|
| 1:44:16| One of the points that I made is that sometimes the biggest problems deals with codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6256)|
| 1:44:22| enforcement, and having penalties that are stiff enough when someone just ignores the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6262)|
| 1:44:28| to take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6268)|
| 1:44:29| And if you look up here to the people that are opposed to the plan, what they were saying here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| they said just leave the current policies in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| but enforce the requirements and policies rather than develop new ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| And so I think even the people that are opposed to the plan recognizes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| that that's maybe what we need to do as much as anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6282)|
| 1:44:45| Fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6285)|
| 1:44:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6287)|
| 1:44:48| I feel like we've had a good discussion tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6288)|

| 1:44:55| What I hope to accomplish tonight was, first of all, clarity so that everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6295)|
| 1:45:00| remember what I said our goal was tonight, number one, to understand each other's point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| Number two, have clarity about slope, clearing, and density, how that works, how that's involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6304)|
| 1:45:10| what the concerns are, what supports are, and then look at some opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| if we need to, to build some flexibility in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| I feel like we got there tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| I hope you felt good about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| We'll do a follow-up, and I will send you guys a summary of this discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6320)|
| 1:45:23| with the possible areas of flexibility that you may decide you want to look at and amend or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6323)|
| 1:45:29| And then we'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| Next time, kind of signposting at least our last meeting as far as I'm contracted to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6331)|
| 1:45:36| is we will discuss some other topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| We'll talk about you guys will be ready in two weeks to address the legality of the document issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6339)|
| 1:45:45| if you guys could do that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6345)|

| 1:45:51| That's all there is to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6351)|
| 1:45:53| And we'll also perhaps do the definition of ridgetop discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| or something else you feel like we need to talk about in that last meeting before we tie up the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6356)|

| 1:46:10| I did, and it came down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-110818-hillside-protection?start=6370)|
