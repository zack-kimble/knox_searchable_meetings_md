| 0:14:32| Owen. Mr. DuPort? Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| I wanted to explain the second version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=875)|
| 0:14:38| just so everybody's on the same page. I went back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| after Monday night and based upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| Mr. Watson's comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=884)|
| 0:14:47| basically took, what is it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| the second page where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| it lists the committee and basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| restored that to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=896)|
| 0:14:59| same type of language that was in the original| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=899)|
| 0:15:02| policy. That was basically because, well, for two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=902)|
| 0:15:05| reasons. One,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| Mr. Watson had a concern about that and frankly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| what I was doing in that area was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=911)|
| 0:15:14| just stating what the law was. If this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=914)|
| 0:15:17| board wants to go beyond the law, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| If this board wants to do less than the law, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| that's where we have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| So that's why I went back and just tried to restore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| basically the same language in there and then of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| this board can go with policy review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=932)|
| 0:15:35| and change this policy however| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| it sees fit. But my main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| goal here is to have the areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| that are redlined in the second version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| passed so that this board will have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| an entirely up-to-date and legal policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=951)|
| 0:15:54| as we go into the charter review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=954)|
| 0:15:57| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Dupler. Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Mr. Dupler. The reason I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=960)|
| 0:16:03| appreciate you making the changes to, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| removing the requested changes to that particular section of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=966)|
| 0:16:09| policy is in our meeting in December, I think that's where the bulk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| of our conversation was. I'm not necessarily thinking that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=972)|
| 0:16:15| original language was the best language, but that's the particular language that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| would like to discuss in policy review and then there may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=978)|
| 0:16:21| other revisions later. So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=981)|
| 0:16:24| All right. So the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=984)|
| 0:16:27| just correct me if I'm wrong here, Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| was to approve version 2 on the first treaty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| and the second was by Ms. Soen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=993)|
| 0:16:36| Correct? Okay. Any other? Ms. Horn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=996)|
| 0:16:39| Thank you, Madam Chair. Just, I mean, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| really fine either way, but I'll just say that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| I would prefer the language that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| may, because I think the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| says that you have to have five people on a review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1011)|
| 0:16:54| I think this is almost double that, so it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| just a lot of people to have to have on a committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| for something that is quite a lot of work to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| applications that are so numerous and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| pay, you know, such a large application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1026)|
| 0:17:09| So, but I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| really, whatever the will of the board is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| I'll just tell you that based on the conversation that I've had with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1035)|
| 0:17:18| Julie Thompson, who has spent a lot of time in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1038)|
| 0:17:21| charter review meetings and that kind of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1041)|
| 0:17:24| that is my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1044)|
| 0:17:27| concern based on the conversation that I had with her about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1047)|
| 0:17:30| the review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| Ms. Soen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| Thank you, Madam Chair. Since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1056)|
| 0:17:39| the committee for this year has already been set and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1059)|
| 0:17:42| already voted on it, can we save shall for a future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| So you're saying vote on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| I'm saying vote on the version that we have on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| The second version? Yes, and then discuss the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| may-shall in policy review. And possibly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| change it. Yeah, that's fine, because, I mean, it doesn't matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| for this, like you said, we already have the committee for right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| I think if we discuss those other changes, then that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| and that way we won't do it three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| Mr. Dupour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| Thank you, Madam Chair. And I was just going to say that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| that was the intent on the second version was that the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| can come back at policy review or even a later date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| and make whatever changes the board sees fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| Just trying to get the board in compliance for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1107)|
| 0:18:30| particular review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| So we have a motion on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| to approve version two on first reading by Mr. Watson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1116)|

| 0:23:41| after having a conversation with the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1421)|
| 0:23:44| member after Monday's meeting, I would just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| like to take a moment to clarify for the public and for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1427)|
| 0:23:50| record that this board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| does oversee the budget, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| So when we talk about salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1436)|
| 0:23:59| schedules and pay, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1439)|
| 0:24:02| and I do believe we've all committed and I do appreciate you bringing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| up the comment about the salary schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| at Monday night, Mr. Watson, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| we're talking about ourselves. I mean, you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| we did approve this budget and it was approved unanimously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1454)|
| 0:24:17| and I think there might be a little bit of confusion out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1457)|
| 0:24:20| there in the public about that so I just wanted to go on the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| just as a reminder that, you know, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| one of our duties as a board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1466)|
| 0:24:29| to oversee the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| So, let's see. That being said, Ms. Sowin, I believe you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| first up. Thank you, Ms. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1475)|
| 0:24:38| In thinking about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1478)|
| 0:24:41| since Monday and how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1481)|
| 0:24:44| we're talking about it, it occurs to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| that what we're doing with this grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1487)|
| 0:24:50| or with this contract is solving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| the wrong problem. It's like when you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| a word problem in math and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| you solve it and you do it correctly but it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| the problem that the question was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| The problem that we have is with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| attracting and retaining custodial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| staff. The result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| of that problem is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1514)|
| 0:25:17| the cleanliness of schools. But the problem that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1517)|
| 0:25:20| we have is attracting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| and retaining those employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| And we are not currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1526)|
| 0:25:29| doing anything to solve that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| So I think it's important that we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| what this contract really does. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1535)|
| 0:25:38| a very expensive band-aid for a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1538)|
| 0:25:41| short amount of time that doesn't solve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1541)|
| 0:25:44| the real problem. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1547)|
| 0:25:51| Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Owen, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| I don't think it's solving the ultimate problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| I think sometimes when you have problems there's short-term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| band-aid solutions and I would call this that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| And then there's also the longer term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1563)|
| 0:26:09| Do you all feel like Siri's just always listening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1569)|
| 0:26:12| to you? I was speaking to Ms. Hummelgarn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| today and it's the same thing. On our phone call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| Siri responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| Okay, so where was I at in that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| Band-aids, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1584)|
| 0:26:27| But then there's obviously the more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| systemic challenges that we have and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| that's ultimately what we're facing because the challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| that we're facing with our custodians is not something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1596)|
| 0:26:39| that is reflective of even just this year. I mean, we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1599)|
| 0:26:42| at a deficit in this for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| And so Ms. Hummelgarn, would you speak a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1605)|
| 0:26:48| to kind of the current work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| that we're doing to try to help rectify some of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| But then also if you can speak to some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| that you all are planning on doing. And then ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| what I would ask, because I think this is a band-aid solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| I think it would be important for this, for central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| office, for Dr. Reiswick, for you and the team to report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| back to the board maybe in the next three months or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1629)|
| 0:27:12| and say, hey, here's how it's going with Duncan & Sons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| and here's the other things we're doing and here's the results we're seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| You know, did we close the gap by 20 positions in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| three months? I don't know. Maybe we will, right? But I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1641)|
| 0:27:24| because of the nature of this, it would be good to kind of get a report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| out. But I would love to hear from Ms. Hummelgarn in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| kind of what we're currently doing and kind of what's on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1653)|
| 0:27:36| I mean, you all know this is a problem, right? So yeah, what's the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| Absolutely. Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, members of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1659)|
| 0:27:42| there are several things that we're doing. Both work that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1662)|
| 0:27:45| we have already been doing and will continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| A few things that have stemmed from the meeting on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| night, some things that were brought up at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| So one item that was noted was the 1008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1674)|
| 0:27:57| starting salary for custodians specifically versus the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| 1089. That was an error on our Munis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| site and we've corrected that. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| had, the team had already started reviewing the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1687)|
| 0:28:10| process and will continue to do so. We do have the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| application currently for all staff members. So we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1693)|
| 0:28:17| viewing to see if there are, if it makes sense to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1697)|
| 0:28:20| different applications for different categories of job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| postings to make that a little bit less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| burdensome. We will continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| review and bring proposals in the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1711)|
| 0:28:35| discussions. There was a conversation on Monday about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| the salary study, which would produce potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1718)|
| 0:28:41| recommendations for FY25. That does not mean that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1721)|
| 0:28:44| not going to take any action or make any proposals with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1724)|
| 0:28:47| FY24. It means that we may not make sweeping changes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| our salary schedule, but it doesn't mean that we wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| propose percentage increases for next year or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| other type of increases. I will let Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| Moseman, Alex Moseman, our Executive Director of Talent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| Acquisition, is here tonight, too, and I will let him share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| with you all some things that the talent team is doing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| addition to those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1753)|
| 0:29:25| Madam Chair, members of the board, so I'll just echo what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| Ms. Hemelgarn had already shared and acknowledged, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1768)|
| 0:29:31| the challenge that we're all facing just in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| recruiting and retaining talent across the district. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| don't know that KCS is unique in the labor market in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| of our ability to recruit and retain talent in this present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1780)|
| 0:29:43| moment. And what we know, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1783)|
| 0:29:46| several of you have rightly pointed out, is one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1786)|
| 0:29:49| fundamental and sort of technical challenges that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| working through is how do we make it easier for folks to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| raise their hand and say, I want to work for KCS, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| how do we take that process and make sure that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1798)|
| 0:30:01| connecting folks to the right hiring manager and getting them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| into the right role. And so we have a quick interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1804)|
| 0:30:07| form that we've been using, kind of piloting for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| now, to make sure that folks can, from a mobile device,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| express interest that can go to a member of the talent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| acquisition team, and then we can work to make sure that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| get that person plugged into the right hiring manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1819)|
| 0:30:23| That's something that's applicable across all roles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1823)|
| 0:30:26| because we know that recruiting custodians is fundamentally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1826)|
| 0:30:29| at the same time, the same process as it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| potentially be for recruiting teachers or other certified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| staff as well. So that's one sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1835)|
| 0:30:38| technical fix that we're working through to try to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1838)|
| 0:30:41| that we are, again, making it easier for folks to say, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| ready to work for KCS, I'm ready to make a difference in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| Knox County schools. But additionally, we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| really working through the process of thinking about how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1850)|
| 0:30:53| we sell the district as a place that you can be a part of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| community and grow and thrive. And so what does that look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| like from a messaging standpoint, what are the technical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| pieces behind that, how might you build some more of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| digital infrastructure that allows us to tell that story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| to do so in a fiscally responsible way, and also do so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| in a really targeted way. So there's a lot of work kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| of happening behind the scenes that you'll start to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| from this month and on through June, and then we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| have a chance to kind of take a step back, see what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1880)|
| 0:31:23| works, make some tweaks, and continue to iterate over time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1883)|
| 0:31:26| about how we want to make sure that, again, if you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| work for KCS, if you're ready to make a difference in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1889)|
| 0:31:32| schools, that we make it simple and easy for you to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| plugged in and that we have a process that supports folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| in finding the right seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| Are you continuing? Okay. Mr. Mosman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| in particular with our custodial positions, where are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| some of the places that we're getting the word out to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| Probably Indeed, right? But where are we trying to source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| custodians from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1913)|
| 0:31:56| That's a great question. I think right now what we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1916)|
| 0:31:59| trying to figure out is are there issues with our process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1919)|
| 0:32:02| internally potentially? Are there places where we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| tweak those things to make sure that we are getting folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| who might be somewhere in our system that are ready to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| in a custodial position or potentially eligible for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| custodian position, and then getting them connected to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| right place, and so it's kind of working inside out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| We haven't yet launched sort of a more full scale of here's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| how we're going to connect folks, but do plan to launch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| some work in the coming months to make sure that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| embedded with more community-based organizations that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| would be targeted at classified recruitment, which would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1952)|
| 0:32:35| include custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1955)|
| 0:32:39| Our starting pay at step zero is $10.89 for this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1959)|
| 0:32:42| position. Can somebody bring in experience from another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| employer and already be bumped up that scale?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| So it's $10.89 if you have no prior experience in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| industry, but not with KCS, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1971)|
| 0:32:55| Correct. Can bring in up to five years of verified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1975)|
| 0:32:58| experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1978)|
| 0:33:01| So if you have previous experience at another employer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| up to five years, you could jump up that scale from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1984)|
| 0:33:07| start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| Mr. Boseman, I just want to say I love these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| I think you gave them to every board member, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1996)|
| 0:33:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| And I have scanned the QR code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2002)|
| 0:33:25| Is that the form you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| Give me one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| I can tell if you submitted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2011)|
| 0:33:34| I love that, too, because I think the thinking behind it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| and we're always trying to talk about how do we make complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2017)|
| 0:33:40| simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| That's the role of administration in leadership, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2023)|
| 0:33:46| And I think the unique thing about these, can you talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2026)|
| 0:33:49| what happens once they're sent in and how that process goes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| I think that's important, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2032)|
| 0:33:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2035)|
| 0:33:58| So what we're trying to think about is we know all of us have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| the ability to recruit folks to be a part of helping us recruit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| staff and make that as easy as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2044)|
| 0:34:07| So if someone scans that code and they submit that form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2047)|
| 0:34:10| there will be a form that pops up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2050)|
| 0:34:13| I'll get an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2053)|
| 0:34:16| Clarence Serranger will get an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2056)|
| 0:34:19| That information populates into kind of a tracking spreadsheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| that we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2062)|
| 0:34:25| That person also automatically then gets an email to schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| to Mr. Serranger, our district talent acquisition specialist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| And then from there, we're working to make sure that we stay in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2071)|
| 0:34:34| contact with those folks and find the right seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| So that's sort of the technical way in which we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| What's nice is that, again, this is really simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| It's really easy for us to apply this same use case across lots of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| different places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| And so that form itself can be linked in digital advertising as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2089)|
| 0:34:52| well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| It can be used to not only convert candidates but also analyze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| sort of what's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| So we've got a system to make sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| if you've submitted that interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| you've gotten a certain number of touch points that we're continuing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| to convert folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| Can you look at the analytics in terms of where people are getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| to this link from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| Not yet, but we will hopefully build on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2119)|
| 0:35:22| It's premature on an interest form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| Like, I mean, to me, I know why we want that later to track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| demographics and all the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| But in terms of, like, are you interested in working for KCS and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| are you white or Hispanic and female,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| for that to be up front on the interest form to me seems a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2137)|
| 0:35:40| premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| I'm sure you gave thought in terms of why you did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| Can you help us understand that part of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| We want to be able to track and understand sort of demographic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| trends within that interest form to make sure that we don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| disparities between the way in which we as KCS are converting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| those leads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2158)|
| 0:36:01| Is that something that historically, because this is new, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2161)|
| 0:36:04| this interest form, where was it tracked before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2164)|
| 0:36:07| Was that within the application process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2167)|
| 0:36:10| Yeah, it's also tracked in the application process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2170)|
| 0:36:13| Sorry, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| I definitely don't think we need to be in day-to-day management,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| but my thought is, like, if it's already tracked in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2180)|
| 0:36:23| application, I don't know that I would track it on the interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| It just seems too much too quick when you're just trying to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| are you interested in working here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| You're already asking personal questions before they've even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| shared interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| But I do love the approach, and I appreciate the work on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| interest form, and would like to ask that we, especially if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2208)|
| 0:36:51| pass this contract, and even if we don't, that Dr. Wisewick,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| that you give some kind of report out in a couple months in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| terms of how the progress is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2217)|
| 0:37:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| Ms. Spike, I believe you were next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2226)|
| 0:37:09| I would like to propose a substitute motion to instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| this contract with Duncan & Sons to give a $200 monthly bonus to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| the current custodians and all future custodians for the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| of February 1st to June 30th, 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| I have done the math on that, and that number would give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| within this contract roughly in excess of up to $19,000 of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2245)|
| 0:37:28| wiggle room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| I'm happy to explain my math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| I'm happy to explain my math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2258)|
| 0:37:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| Would you like me to explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2269)|
| 0:37:52| Can you repeat it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| Can you repeat your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| In lieu of this contract to give all current custodians that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| eligible for the $200 monthly bonus from February 1st to June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| 30th, and then also all future custodians for that time period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| they also would get the $200 bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| So essentially, we have up to 383.7 full-time staff that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| give them $200 every month for five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2296)|
| 0:38:23| And then working within the $1,040,000 budget, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| give them $200 every month for five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| And then working within the $1,040,000 budget, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2309)|
| 0:38:33| depending on what the hourly wage is of those extra hires that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2313)|
| 0:38:36| are missing right now, that would potentially give us $19,000 of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| wiggle room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2319)|
| 0:38:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2327)|
| 0:38:50| So we have a substitute motion by Ms. Byke and a second by Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2333)|
| 0:38:56| Reverend Butler, I believe you were next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| I guess I have a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| I was going to speak to the previous motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2343)|
| 0:39:06| This is a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| I'm going to speak to this now or wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| You can speak to both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2352)|
| 0:39:18| Well, I was going to say, I appreciate the point of order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| At this point, you could comment on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2364)|
| 0:39:28| And then if the substitute motion fails, then you could also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| comment on the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| So it's my choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2378)|
| 0:39:41| I'll go ahead and make my comments in question, and then it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| may have an impact on this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2384)|
| 0:39:47| My question, I think, may be to Dr. Adams, if I remember how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| talked about it Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| But how many positions do we have vacant and how many do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| have filled, custodians?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2397)|
| 0:40:04| So we have a total of 392 positions available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| Out of those 392 positions, we have 83 vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2408)|
| 0:40:16| And so the contract was proposed because of the fact that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| have 83 vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2419)|
| 0:40:23| The district cannot meet the standard of cleaning for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2423)|
| 0:40:26| schools with the current vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| And that's the reason why I think you were proposing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| the contract is being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2433)|
| 0:40:37| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| And I do apologize, Madam Chair, Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| So the question I have, the question for me is, as I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| going to ask earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| In fact, what I was going to say was my first job in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| military was a combat medic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| And band-aids were used after you get a shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| But when you get a shot, you have to wear a band-aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2466)|
| 0:41:10| And you have to wear a band-aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2470)|
| 0:41:13| You get a shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| But when you were in a critical condition and losing blood, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| used a tourniquet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| And I think we are in tourniquet condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| So this is a tourniquet and not a band-aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| And I'm not sure if the proposal of, and I do support what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2488)|
| 0:41:31| proposal wants us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2491)|
| 0:41:37| But I think right now we have to stop the bleeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2497)|
| 0:41:41| And so this contract, I don't see it as outsourcing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| I see it as a stopgap that we have to stop the bleeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2506)|
| 0:41:50| I see what I understood from those who discussed on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2510)|
| 0:41:53| night, the schools that have the worst shortages, the concern is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2513)|
| 0:42:00| keeping the custodians you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| Even if you give them more money, they still are doing two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| If you have three people and seven people supposed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| there, then you've got three people doing seven people's job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| And if you give them more, $2 an hour, $200 a month, they still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2535)|
| 0:42:20| are doing more work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2540)|
| 0:42:23| And they're not capable of doing that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2543)|
| 0:42:26| So that's why I think that we have to have this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2546)|
| 0:42:29| because it is a stopgap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| That's the way I look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| And I do think, I do have one other question, and I hope it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| answered, that in the contract that has been presented, I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2558)|
| 0:42:43| we're paying about $200,000 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2563)|
| 0:42:46| How many positions have we contracted for them to fill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| Have we contracted them to fill all 83?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2572)|
| 0:42:55| So what's the number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2575)|
| 0:42:58| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2578)|
| 0:43:01| They have approximately 50 positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| So we contract for 50 positions that they will fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2584)|
| 0:43:08| If they do not fill these positions, do we still pay them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| No, they have to fulfill their obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| So we pay them for the positions that they fill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| If they fill 25, we pay them for 25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2597)|
| 0:43:20| Correct me if I'm wrong, Mr. Dupler, but that would be a breach of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| contract if they did not fill the 50 positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2603)|
| 0:43:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| Yes, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| I mean, I'd have to look at the remedy, but I mean, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2612)|
| 0:43:36| So is there a deadline of filling the positions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| From the start date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| All 50 positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| Starting February 1st, they're supposed to fill 50 positions, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| throughout the length of the contract, they would keep those 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| positions filled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| Yes, sir, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2634)|
| 0:43:57| And that's the way they get paid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2640)|
| 0:44:03| So we still would be able to meet the standards that are called for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| Yes, sir, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| I think that's all my questions and comments at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| And Madam Chair, Dr. Butler, I would be remiss if I don't say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| Niles County Schools gave a bonus of $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| And Lori can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| And we were not able to retain or get additional applicants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| The applicants that we did get, they took the $500 and they left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| No one was able to get the $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| So it attracted people for the duration of the bonus, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| So this is not a new proposal that Niles County School has done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2677)|
| 0:44:40| This is something that we've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2680)|
| 0:44:43| And just to be quite frank, it failed miserably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| And when you say this is not a new proposal, you mean the proposal to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| give more money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| The bonus, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| Mr. Watt, or Mr. DePauw, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| I just wanted to address Dr. Adams' question, Reverend Butler's question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| about rectifying any problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| We did talk about that a little bit on Monday night as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| In the main contract, it talks about any issues need to be resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2710)|
| 0:45:13| within 72 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| And we did talk about that a little bit on Monday night as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| In the main contract, it talks about any issues need to be resolved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2719)|
| 0:45:23| within 72 hours by communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2723)|
| 0:45:26| And if not resolved, then the contract could be terminated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2726)|
| 0:45:29| 30 days' notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2729)|
| 0:45:32| Thank you, Mr. DePauw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| So I think I agree with Mr. Butler, or Reverend Butler, that this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2741)|
| 0:45:44| a tourniquet situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| I think that's much better language than what I use in terms of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2747)|
| 0:45:50| Band-Aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| And I appreciate, Ms. Byke, what you're proposing and the intent of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| what you're proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| And what I heard a lot from the other night on Monday was that also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2759)|
| 0:46:02| the existing employees have been overworked and worn out and all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| So I'm wondering what the thoughts would be about actually doing both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| and thanking those people who have been doing the deal, right, all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| year with short-staffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| And my math's a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| So you're saying $200 a month for five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| That's $1,000 per employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| About 310 employees, that's $310,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| So add that to this contract, you're going to $1.5 million, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2790)|
| 0:46:33| roughly, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| So I'm wondering about a friendly amendment to your substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| which is to do what you're suggesting, and then also fulfilling this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| Which, to me, would honor all the work that people have stepped up and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| done above and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| Maybe a little bit of incentive for new ones, because your proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| was people who get hired on between now and then, they would also get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| that extra $200, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| I think the only thing with that, sorry to interrupt, is that the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| hires would be under the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| We would still be hiring people directly, correct, KCS?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| So for KCS employees, then yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| We're not talking about bonusing Duncan & Sons, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| So the Duncan & Sons contract would stay as is, and as a thank you for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| going above and beyond with a short labor force, and possibly as an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2845)|
| 0:47:28| incentive for new people, because they would get that $200 for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2848)|
| 0:47:31| months that they were here if they jumped on, I think I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| offer a friendly amendment to actually enact the contract and pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| every current custodian $200 a month in extra pay between now and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| end of the five-month period, as well as any new hires for KCS during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| that five-month period, which in my math, that's less than $1.5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| million for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2867)|
| 0:47:50| I would be in support of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| Ms. Sullen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2873)|
| 0:47:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| First, I think it may be important to clarify that the new hires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2879)|
| 0:48:02| for KCS would be $1.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| Ms. Sullen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| First, I think it may be important to call that a bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| We need to check with the finance department on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| Also, I'm not finding in the service agreement or in the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| where it says that we are guaranteed that specific number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| There's a billing summary that has that specific number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| But in the services, all it says is the contractor will provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| services to the client at the following locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| I don't see any guarantee of any number of persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2912)|
| 0:48:40| Can someone help me find that somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2920)|
| 0:48:47| Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| Madam Chair, Ms. Sullen, we have a breakdown, and Mr. Dupler can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2930)|
| 0:48:53| speak to the actual contract, but we have a breakdown per school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2933)|
| 0:48:56| the staffing that Duncan & Sons has agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2936)|
| 0:48:59| which comes up for the total of the 50 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2939)|
| 0:49:02| But as far as what's written in the contract and the agreement that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| we have and the breakdown of the supports per school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2945)|
| 0:49:08| we do have that breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| So, Mr. Dupler, if you'd like to speak to the actual contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2951)|
| 0:49:17| But my understanding is that is tied into the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2957)|
| 0:49:20| the number of people, the breakdown of schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2960)|
| 0:49:24| and the agreement we have with Duncan & Sons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2964)|
| 0:49:27| Well, thank you, Dr. Adams, Ms. Sullen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| Yes, it's my understanding that the way the contract is worded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| it's per school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| And it talks about, you know, each school talks about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| for instance, the one I'm looking at right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2980)|
| 0:49:43| Bearden Middle School, two full-time team members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2983)|
| 0:49:46| So it does talk about those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| And, frankly, what the contract with Duncan & Sons purports to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| is to provide, you know, the high-quality cleaning at these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| certain schools for this certain price for this certain square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| footage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| So if there's any dissatisfaction with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3002)|
| 0:50:05| Dr. Adams and his staff can, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| express that dissatisfaction, have some communications in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3008)|
| 0:50:11| e-mail, and then get it rectified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| And if not, then we could take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3015)|
| 0:50:23| So looking at the billing summary where it says prices reflected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3023)|
| 0:50:26| are estimated and will change based on actual start date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| that I get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| But seeing no guarantee of these numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3032)|
| 0:50:35| and just that it says they will provide professional and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3035)|
| 0:50:38| competent janitorial and related services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3038)|
| 0:50:42| at those locations, it looks to me like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| for example, at Northwest Middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| where it says they will provide four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| if they only provide two and we don't take any action to complain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| then they could continue to just provide two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| Madam Chair, Ms. Owen, the way that it's broken down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| yes, it's broken down by person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| and the dollars are tied to the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| And keep in mind that we will have an on-site head custodian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| who would report directly to their direct supervisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| which is Ms. Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| if an employee is not present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3085)|
| 0:51:28| And that, once again, would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3088)|
| 0:51:31| I would consider a breach of contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3091)|
| 0:51:34| which would have to be rectified immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3094)|
| 0:51:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| I have a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3103)|
| 0:51:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| Was the friendly amendment approved or accepted?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3108)|
| 0:51:53| Ms. Spike accepted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| I think Ms. Owen was the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| Okay, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| So you are accepting it as the second, right, Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| Yes, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3125)|
| 0:52:09| And Dr. Reislick, can we maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| I don't know if you or Mr. McPherson just want to speak to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| and the language that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| would need to be used in the budget impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3141)|
| 0:52:29| I would think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3149)|
| 0:52:31| we'll get Ms. Himmelgarn or Mr. McPherson to come speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3151)|
| 0:52:33| I'd probably have Mr. McPherson come speak to that, if it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3153)|
| 0:52:36| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| Mr. McPherson can speak in far more specifics than I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| but the $1,000 wouldn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3161)|
| 0:52:44| the cost to the district wouldn't just be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| it would be more than just $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| That's why I was saying $1.5, because, yeah, anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3170)|
| 0:52:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3176)|
| 0:52:58| Yes, so $1,000, you would have to take into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3178)|
| 0:53:01| applicable FICA and retirement on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| And so, again, this is kind of a back-of-the-envelope calculation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| but if you apply that to our existing employee force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| you're probably looking at north of $350,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| That's just a rough estimate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| And then the question would be if additional hires along the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3197)|
| 0:53:20| you'd be adding that to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3200)|
| 0:53:23| That's including the $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3203)|
| 0:53:25| That would be the, if it was $1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3205)|
| 0:53:28| I want to be careful not to call it a bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3208)|
| 0:53:31| I mean, you know, because of tax implications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| So it depends on how we, believe it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| it depends on how we would categorize that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| But, yeah, that would be with $1,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| based on our existing employee force, which is roughly maybe $310,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| That's going to vary, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| And so that would, you know, that would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| if what I think I hear the Board saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| would be in addition to the proposed contract here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| So, excuse me, what we looked at is the amount of savings so far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3238)|
| 0:54:06| And when I say savings, I'm talking about strictly employee turnover.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| So I'm just talking about strictly dollars, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3249)|
| 0:54:12| So the proposal was to take the amount, which was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| I'd have to go back and look, but it was really close, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| somewhat in comparison to what this contract was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| So we were just going to redirect those dollars that remain unspent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3263)|
| 0:54:27| into this contract, if the Board approved it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3267)|
| 0:54:31| That would be our mechanism or proposal for funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3271)|
| 0:54:36| Now, an additional amount that would go for bonuses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3276)|
| 0:54:41| then we would need to look in other places of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| Potentially could that run the budget over with respect to the custodial line item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| It could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3290)|
| 0:54:52| It's just hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| There's still, you know, five more months to go into the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| You know, if that were to be the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| then we would just need to go into another line item where potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| there are savings and redirect those dollars into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3301)|
| 0:55:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3308)|
| 0:55:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3309)|
| 0:55:11| And just, you know, just I would like to know, I mean, I'm not opposed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| I mean, I definitely think they have been going above and beyond to do the job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3315)|
| 0:55:21| and obviously are exhausted and struggling to keep up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3321)|
| 0:55:26| I guess my only concern about doing it now, and I don't even know if I would call it a concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3326)|
| 0:55:33| but it is something I'm sitting here thinking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3333)|
| 0:55:36| is we have a lot of other employees in the same situation, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| We've got TAs, cafeteria workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| You know, I guess I had it in my mind that we would be addressing this in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3345)|
| 0:55:52| which we will start discussing soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| Like I said, I'm not saying I'm necessarily against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| I'm just trying to think of our other, you know, employees that might be in the same situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3359)|
| 0:56:10| Ms. Henderson, I don't think you've spoken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3370)|
| 0:56:12| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3372)|
| 0:56:14| I was actually had my light on because I had the same concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3374)|
| 0:56:17| What kind of impact does that have on our other support staff, like our TAs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| our food service workers who work really hard as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| And I'm not opposed to giving bonuses, but I would like to see it more well thought out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3386)|
| 0:56:32| in regards to those other staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| I know that some of the custodians work different hours than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| Would the bonus be the same for all of them, depending on what hours they work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| I just think there's a lot of questions that need to be answered, and while I'm not opposed to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3404)|
| 0:56:48| I think that during the budget cycle would be the time that I would be more comfortable to address this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3408)|
| 0:56:58| I'm trying to see who is next here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| I think it's you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3423)|
| 0:57:04| Mr. McPherson, sorry, I actually had a question for you, and I know you already jumped back in your seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3424)|
| 0:57:10| So you are estimating that would roughly be $350,000 with the bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| and then any additional taxes that might be associated with it, add that to the $1,040,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3434)|
| 0:57:22| You're a little less than $1.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| So what I think I heard you saying is that when you all looked at the savings from unfilled positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3444)|
| 0:57:30| that we've had up until now in this category, that it was close to that $1,040,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3450)|
| 0:57:35| that anything above that you feel pretty confident would need to come from another source?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| Well, I would answer it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| I would literally have to go back and look and see what that number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| I remember when we looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| Keep in mind that was actually an estimate, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| because what we did is we looked at the average custodial salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| and the average vacancy rate at the end of each month, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| And then so we kind of – so we would – other than just going into every single employee that was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| So that was an estimate as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3486)|
| 0:58:08| So I can't remember the exact dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| It was definitely enough through the turnover based on our estimated amount at that time to redirect those dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3492)|
| 0:58:21| We were comfortable in redirecting those dollars into this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3501)|
| 0:58:26| Any amount over and above that, I'm not saying there's not wiggle room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3506)|
| 0:58:30| There should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3510)|
| 0:58:32| But we would – yes, the short answer is if the contract along with the personnel exceeded the custodial budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3512)|
| 0:58:42| then we would – obviously we would need to go back into the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| and look at areas of savings and other areas, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3526)|
| 0:58:48| Yeah. So if this is budget neutral and we approve this tonight, there's no issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| But if it's not budget neutral, is it up to central administration to determine where it actually comes from if it gets approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3533)|
| 0:59:01| That – well, it would basically bear a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3541)|
| 0:59:03| So it would likely – what would happen is if we saw that were to start to go over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3543)|
| 0:59:07| it would be included in the quarterly line item transfers that we bring before the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3547)|
| 0:59:11| And so the board – we provide those to the board, and we show the areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| Now, we do it by account number, but we show the areas where that would come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| And if the board had any question, obviously, what those account numbers related to, we could – we would definitely answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3557)|
| 0:59:24| But, yeah, it would probably be in the form of a – it would be within the other line item transfers that we submit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3564)|
| 0:59:28| Yeah. Ms. Christie and Ms. Anderson, I certainly understand your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3568)|
| 0:59:33| I didn't come tonight thinking I was going to make a friendly amendment like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3573)|
| 0:59:38| And I think I can be supportive of that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| I did offer it, but I'm also supportive of the original, of just passing the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| I think my real concern is if we do – if we take an action and do not install this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3585)|
| 0:59:52| I think what we're going to find is in three or four months, we've got dirtier schools than we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| I just – this is not a lack of faith in Ms. Himmelgaard and Ms. Mosman and all the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3596)|
| 1:00:01| I just do not think this issue is going to solve itself with our current – in our current mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3601)|
| 1:00:06| It's just not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3606)|
| 1:00:08| And so we can either make the choice to try to do something to put a tourniquet, or we can watch it bleed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| And that's – I think that's probably what I'm more opposed to than anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3613)|
| 1:00:18| I would agree with that. Ms. Horne, you've not spoken yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3622)|
| 1:00:23| And I think – I think, Mr. Watson, that's why to me this is two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3623)|
| 1:00:27| We're talking about – we've combined something, but we're really talking about two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3627)|
| 1:00:32| Because as has been said, we have a problem that we need to solve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| We also have a lot of hardworking folks that I think we all appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3636)|
| 1:00:41| And as Ms. Christie and Ms. Henderson have said, I feel the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| I'm not opposed to showing appreciation at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| However, I would be concerned with doing that while not considering the big picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3650)|
| 1:00:55| and considering the other staff members who are at that same pay scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3655)|
| 1:01:00| Because we have a lot of people who are working a lot of hours and working really hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3660)|
| 1:01:06| So I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| I think these are two different things that need to be looked at as two separate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3668)|
| 1:01:16| Ms. Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| Can someone off the top of their head tell me what the pay scale is for a custodial supervisor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3679)|
| 1:01:29| Is that different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3689)|
| 1:01:38| Madam Chair, Ms. Spike, our custodial salary schedule, we have three sections to the schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3698)|
| 1:01:45| So one would be custodian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| The second two are head custodian, depending on how big the team is that they supervise in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3708)|
| 1:01:56| I think you all have heard, our custodial pay scale starts at $10.89 and tops out at $16.82.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3716)|
| 1:02:04| The B scale for head custodian for the smaller staff starts at $11.28 and goes to $17.49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3724)|
| 1:02:13| The C starts at $12.33 and goes to $19.07.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| And then we have a dream team leader that goes up to $19.84.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| Okay. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| And my comment to that would be is that I don't view these as two separate things because these other staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3745)|
| 1:02:33| they're not looking at working with people who are potentially getting paid more per hour while they've been doing the job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3753)|
| 1:02:42| And they absolutely need appreciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3762)|
| 1:02:46| Fifteen years ago, I worked at Starbucks, and I made $7 an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3766)|
| 1:02:52| And when I had to train my manager, when I was making $7 an hour, that was miserable for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| And it didn't help me want to stay in that job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| And I can only imagine that some of these head custodians are going to feel the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| And I think that if we are tourniqueting the situation, we also need to band-aid the other situation at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3785)|
| 1:03:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| I don't perceive this as showing appreciation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| I perceive this as helping our folks who are here to stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3802)|
| 1:03:28| We need to not lose any more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| Earlier this year, we had 28 positions which were reorganized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3812)|
| 1:03:39| and those 28 saw raises that averaged $10,000 each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3819)|
| 1:03:46| We can do what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3826)|
| 1:03:49| If we want to give our custodians appropriate pay, we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3829)|
| 1:03:55| It's a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| And we need to very carefully consider the choices that we're making.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3838)|
| 1:04:06| Mr. Triplett, I don't know if you've had a chance to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3851)|
| 1:04:12| I think that everybody would love to support custodians' pay increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| All that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| I think, again, I agree with Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| These are separate issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3861)|
| 1:04:22| I think that we vote on the contract and approve the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| Then we can take a look at finances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3866)|
| 1:04:28| and see if there's a line item available for us to make a transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3868)|
| 1:04:32| But if this is pretty close to budget neutral, then that's all we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| And if we have other resources available, then we can take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3876)|
| 1:04:39| I think we've talked and talked and talked and talked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3879)|
| 1:04:42| I'd like to call for the vote, if I can get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| I've been waiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3889)|
| 1:04:51| I had the light on before anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| But because we had an amendment and then we had a friendly amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3894)|
| 1:05:00| I haven't had a chance to speak to the friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3900)|
| 1:05:14| According to Robert's rules, at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3914)|
| 1:05:17| once the vote's been called for and it's seconded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| then the board would need to vote to call for the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3920)|
| 1:05:28| So Ms. Coatney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| So this vote will be for calling for the vote on item 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| Mr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3934)|
| 1:05:36| I vote no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3936)|
| 1:05:37| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3937)|
| 1:05:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3939)|
| 1:05:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3940)|
| 1:05:41| Ms. Byke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| Ms. Horn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3944)|
| 1:05:46| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| Mr. Triplett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3954)|
| 1:05:55| Ms. Horn, would you like to change your pass vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3955)|
| 1:05:59| That's five yes votes and four no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3959)|
| 1:06:06| So that motion passes to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3966)|
| 1:06:09| So we will be voting on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3969)|
| 1:06:15| So this is the substitute motion with the friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3975)|
| 1:06:19| that was approved by Ms. Byke and Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| Dr. Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3984)|
| 1:06:26| Okay, so we're voting on the friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3986)|
| 1:06:30| This is the full substitute motion with the friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3990)|
| 1:06:33| So it would be keep the contract and do the bonuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| Is that correct, Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| Was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| I do have a – I mean, I think it is important what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4000)|
| 1:06:43| I mean, I think it is important what we call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4003)|
| 1:06:45| and I think we need to be advised on whether or not we call this a bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4005)|
| 1:06:48| I know Mr. McPherson just said that could be challenging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4008)|
| 1:06:51| Is there preferred language from central office in terms of what this is called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4011)|
| 1:07:01| Madam Chair, members of the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4021)|
| 1:07:02| I will ask Mr. McPherson on the preferred language of bonus versus stipend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4022)|
| 1:07:09| or something similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4029)|
| 1:07:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| So it really is basically how it's taxed on the front end, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4035)|
| 1:07:20| It's no more taxed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4040)|
| 1:07:21| It's taxed on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4041)|
| 1:07:22| So I think in times past we've called it –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4042)|
| 1:07:26| I don't know if I'm necessarily recommending this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4046)|
| 1:07:27| but we've used words like incentive before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4047)|
| 1:07:31| What's the most advantageous for the employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| You mean with respect to bonus versus not bonus?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4056)|
| 1:07:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4058)|
| 1:07:39| Well, so they're going to be taxed regardless, right, by the federal government, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4059)|
| 1:07:47| It's just a matter of how much withholding on the front end, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| So advantageous is probably an eye of the beholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| I just know that –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4073)|
| 1:07:54| What keeps more money in their pocket?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4074)|
| 1:07:58| Initially not using the word bonus, but ultimately it's still the same amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4078)|
| 1:08:02| So incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| I would propose incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| So what we are voting on would be to keep the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4089)|
| 1:08:15| but also do an incentive of, was it $200 a month for five months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4095)|
| 1:08:23| for existing custodians as well as any new hires to KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4103)|
| 1:08:29| Is that correct, just for clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4109)|
| 1:08:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4112)|
| 1:08:33| So that is the motion we are voting on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| Ms. Coatney, if you will do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4116)|
| 1:08:39| Dr. Battler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4120)|
| 1:08:41| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4121)|
| 1:08:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4122)|
| 1:08:43| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4123)|
| 1:08:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4124)|
| 1:08:45| Ms. Byke?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4125)|
| 1:08:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4126)|
| 1:08:47| Ms. Horn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4127)|
| 1:08:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4128)|
| 1:08:49| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4130)|
| 1:08:51| Mr. Triplett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| Mr. McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| Ms. Christie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4136)|
| 1:08:57| That's four yes votes and five no votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4137)|
| 1:08:58| So motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4138)|
| 1:08:59| We are back to our original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4139)|
| 1:09:02| Is that correct, Mr. Duport?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4142)|
| 1:09:05| To approve the contract with Duncan and Sons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4145)|
| 1:09:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| And, well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| Would you like to add anything to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| I was just going to say if there is additional discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4157)|
| 1:09:20| technically the call for the vote was for the other motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4160)|
| 1:09:24| So we can still discuss this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4164)|
| 1:09:25| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4166)|
| 1:09:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4167)|
| 1:09:28| Governor Battler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| Well, thank you for giving me an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4170)|
| 1:09:35| And, quite honestly, it's not humorous to me because my light was on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4175)|
| 1:09:40| before a number of people's light was on before we started discussing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4180)|
| 1:09:46| substitute motion or the amendment, friendly amendment to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4186)|
| 1:09:50| substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4190)|
| 1:09:51| So I think it was unfair for me not to be able to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4191)|
| 1:09:56| But now I have an opportunity to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4196)|
| 1:09:59| I wanted to ask the question, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| just to make sure because I understand that we have the contract provider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4203)|
| 1:10:11| saying they're going to provide a certain amount of positions every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| If those positions are not fulfilled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| then we will have an opportunity to bring attention to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4218)|
| 1:10:23| and they will have 72 hours to correct that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4223)|
| 1:10:26| And the second thing I wanted to say is that the analogy of a tourniquet is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| that you can only leave a tourniquet on for so long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4231)|
| 1:10:35| and then it will no longer be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| And so this being something that we're using as a stopgap,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| if we are contracted through June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| so we have to do something so that we don't have to do this in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4246)|
| 1:10:50| Because if we're doing this in July, it's no longer a tourniquet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4250)|
| 1:10:53| Because whatever you put the tourniquet on to stop the bleeding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4253)|
| 1:10:57| that's going to be not usable anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4257)|
| 1:11:01| So I think it's important that we continue all of our efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4261)|
| 1:11:05| and even look at even things that may be out of the box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4265)|
| 1:11:09| so that we can make sure that we have custodial staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4269)|
| 1:11:12| that we're not using a contract to fulfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4272)|
| 1:11:20| Thank you. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4280)|
| 1:11:23| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| Dr. Adams, on Monday I had asked you the question about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4284)|
| 1:11:29| do they have to hire these folks or do they already have them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| and you said they could start February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4292)|
| 1:11:38| I feel like I'm pretty detailed, but Ms. Owen kills me on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| She's just incredibly detailed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| I do think, after her raising that point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4303)|
| 1:11:45| I do have a little bit of a concern in terms of the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4305)|
| 1:11:50| and them having to fulfill that obligation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4310)|
| 1:11:53| When you answered that on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| is that based on conversations that you've had with management there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| that they already have them on staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| Because there's nothing in the contract, obviously, that states that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| I will certainly, and I've met with Duncan and Sons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| and Lori has met with them a great deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| I'll have Lori come up and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| But when we looked and assessed the schools, and keep in mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4334)|
| 1:12:17| they've walked several of these schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4337)|
| 1:12:19| they said that they had those employees ready to start at those schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4339)|
| 1:12:23| So I'll let Lori speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4343)|
| 1:12:25| She went to the planning portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| The conversation that I've had with Duncan and Sons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4348)|
| 1:12:33| is that they currently have 300 plus or minus custodians on staff currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4353)|
| 1:12:43| Their plan is to pull from some of their seasoned custodians at other places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4363)|
| 1:12:49| and create teams combined with new hires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| I don't know what that ratio is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4374)|
| 1:12:56| I don't know what they're looking to hire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4376)|
| 1:12:58| for Knox County Schools specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4378)|
| 1:13:00| But they have assured me that they can have the 50 people February 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4380)|
| 1:13:07| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4387)|
| 1:13:09| So from your understanding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4389)|
| 1:13:10| there's probably some level of hiring they have to do between now and then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| it sounds like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4393)|
| 1:13:15| Whether it be to place custodians at Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4395)|
| 1:13:19| Or maybe fill something that they're pulling somebody off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4399)|
| 1:13:22| Right, right. I don't know exactly what that number is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4402)|
| 1:13:26| Yeah. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4406)|
| 1:13:27| And we don't need to be in that level of detail in their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4410)|
| 1:13:31| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4411)|
| 1:13:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4412)|
| 1:13:33| Madam Chair, I'd like a question on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4413)|
| 1:13:36| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4416)|
| 1:13:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4419)|
| 1:13:40| So we have a call for the question and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4420)|
| 1:13:48| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4429)|
| 1:13:50| Mr. McMillan, I don't believe you're light on nor were you called on, were you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| You don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| Can you just shout that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4435)|
| 1:13:56| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4436)|
| 1:13:57| Just shout it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4437)|
| 1:13:58| Well, rock and roll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4438)|
| 1:13:59| I'm going to start shouting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4441)|
| 1:14:02| You can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4446)|
| 1:14:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| Thank you, Ms. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4451)|
| 1:14:13| So we will do another roll call vote on calling for the question, Ms. Coatney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4453)|
| 1:14:20| Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4463)|
| 1:14:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4465)|
| 1:14:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4466)|
| 1:14:27| Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4470)|
| 1:14:31| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4471)|
| 1:14:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4472)|
| 1:14:33| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4473)|
| 1:14:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4476)|
| 1:14:37| Ms. Byke, would you like to change your vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4477)|
| 1:14:39| That's eight yes votes and one pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=4479)|

| 1:35:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5700)|
| 1:35:14| all right we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5714)|
| 1:35:16| are back for the last item on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5716)|
| 1:35:21| our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| three legislative priorities. So moved. Second. Motion by Ms. Owen, a second by Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5723)|
| 1:35:31| Ms. Owen. Thank you Madam Chair. Based on our discussion from Monday, first I want to remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5731)|
| 1:35:39| our board that these are legislative priorities and they are not the same as a list of position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5739)|
| 1:35:45| statements. So when we are putting our priorities together, what we have discussed in the past is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5745)|
| 1:35:51| the importance of keeping them as concise as possible. And I'll tell you the version you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5751)|
| 1:35:58| in front of you that's three pages is the exact same thing that you had attached to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5758)|
| 1:36:04| The only reason it's three pages is due to a printer problem. So I just bolded everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5764)|
| 1:36:10| to make it clear enough that we could read it. And when that happened, of course it made it bigger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| and it kicked it to three pages. So when I put that back into its normal font, it'll all be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5775)|
| 1:36:19| back on two pages just like it is attached to the agenda. So that said, what we've discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5779)|
| 1:36:26| in the past is that when we take these to our legislators, we want to have it as concise as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5786)|
| 1:36:30| possible so that they're not flipping through trying to figure out what it is that Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| Schools wants. So in the past we have gone with a front and back that they can very easily look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5795)|
| 1:36:41| I would much rather have it all on one front page so that they could just see it all in one look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5801)|
| 1:36:47| But there was some discussion about making the larger font and going a little larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5807)|
| 1:36:55| So there are some other large counties who have multiple pages to the point of having a booklet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5815)|
| 1:37:03| of legislative priorities. And that seems very difficult for legislators to keep up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5823)|
| 1:37:10| So keeping it as small as possible I think is important. The place where we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5830)|
| 1:37:16| gone larger, we've tried to put bullet points to make that as clear as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5836)|
| 1:37:24| In this version, here's what I have added from Monday. If you go under academic and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5844)|
| 1:37:30| retention decisions in the very last paragraph, we discussed including appropriate and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5850)|
| 1:37:36| we said data-based, which is difficult. I changed that to evidence-based. And if anyone has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5856)|
| 1:37:45| an objection to that, I'm glad to go back to data. But appropriate evidence-based teacher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| training and materials for reading and literacy instruction. There was some discussion around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5870)|
| 1:37:56| whether to include the language science of reading and it was my understanding that we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5876)|
| 1:38:02| not going to include that. I'd like to go a little bit further with that discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5882)|
| 1:38:09| because it kind of applies to everything. That's a term that means different things to different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5889)|
| 1:38:15| people. To some people when we hear that science of reading, we think what we're talking about is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5895)|
| 1:38:20| evidence-based. We think what we're talking about is reading that is based in science.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5900)|
| 1:38:27| However, there are some groups who don't read it that way. They read that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5907)|
| 1:38:35| a formula that is very scripted, that is very exact, and that doesn't give teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5915)|
| 1:38:41| the ability to do what's necessary for students necessarily. So if we have something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5921)|
| 1:38:48| that looks very clear-cut and obvious to two different groups of people as being two very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5928)|
| 1:38:55| different things, I think we need to do what we can to avoid that confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5935)|
| 1:39:00| because it's not saying the same things to everyone. I have also tried to remove anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5940)|
| 1:39:07| that might be a political hot-button phrase. We need to remember that when we carry these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5947)|
| 1:39:16| we are taking them to people of all parties, and so we don't want to have something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5956)|
| 1:39:25| is going to get stuck somewhere and be offensive to our legislators when we are trying to get them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5965)|
| 1:39:32| to work together to work for schools. So that is important also. The next thing I included here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5972)|
| 1:39:40| is the TANF language, and it is the language from TSBA. I took out the reference to TSBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5980)|
| 1:39:48| and changed that to Knox County Board of Education. Under funding for public education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5988)|
| 1:39:55| we removed all the sub-bullet points and all references to BEP. We also removed the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=5995)|
| 1:40:03| source information there about numbers. And so the top bullet, continued investments in school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6003)|
| 1:40:11| nurses, counselors, social workers, and mental health professionals, is what I came down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6011)|
| 1:40:16| The next large change is at the bottom of that page under Review and Correct Unnecessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6016)|
| 1:40:22| Requirements. If you'll take a look at that, that's also TSBA's language, and that first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6022)|
| 1:40:27| paragraph is what came from TSBA with the change of Knox County Schools in place of TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6027)|
| 1:40:39| I left in the paragraph we had before about burdensome processes and procedures. We may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6039)|
| 1:40:47| feel that that's too wordy there, so I'd be glad to cut that down some more if anyone likes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6047)|
| 1:40:55| The next point on the third page, which will actually bump back up and be on the second page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6055)|
| 1:41:01| is transparency. The Knox County Board of Education supports the efforts of the General| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6061)|
| 1:41:05| Assembly to empower parents through transparency by clarifying the rights of parents regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6065)|
| 1:41:11| their child's education. I think transparency is something we have discussed repeatedly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6071)|
| 1:41:17| and I don't know of any objection to that that anyone has brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6077)|
| 1:41:24| Does anyone have any questions about any of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| What? Oh, it says 2022. Well, all right, we'll fix that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6087)|
| 1:41:37| Thank you. Do you see anything that needs to be removed in any of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6097)|
| 1:41:48| Thank you, Madam Chair. There's a couple things I would like to see added on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6108)|
| 1:41:52| I did provide them as amendments. We can just vote on them individually. I did take off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6112)|
| 1:41:59| I will take off the transparency since it is included in the document, but I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6119)|
| 1:42:04| see a more robust item on literacy instruction, and I did supply that along with a definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6124)|
| 1:42:14| of science of reading on there, and I may ask Dr. Phillips to come up and speak on that a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6134)|
| 1:42:21| bit. What I did have, just so, because not everyone has a document, the Knox County Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6141)|
| 1:42:26| of Education believes that phonics is fundamental for children to learn to read. The Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6146)|
| 1:42:31| Board of Education urges the state legislative bodies to continue to support the science of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6151)|
| 1:42:36| reading through teacher trainings and materials for literacy instruction. The science of reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6156)|
| 1:42:41| is defined as a body of research that incorporates insights and research from disciplines that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6161)|
| 1:42:46| include developmental psychology, educational psychology, cognitive science, and cognitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6166)|
| 1:42:53| neuroscience. The science of reading has demonstrated the methods that best help children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6173)|
| 1:42:58| learn to read from the earliest steps in spoken language to being able to successfully decode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6178)|
| 1:43:03| unfamiliar words. I think that we're at a turning point in literacy. It is in the spotlight locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6183)|
| 1:43:12| in the spotlight at the state level, and nationally. I think if a person can't read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| they don't have the freedom to take advantage of every opportunity that this country has to offer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6196)|
| 1:43:21| and I'm not pretending to be an expert in literacy, but what I am required to do as a policymaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6201)|
| 1:43:26| is be able to fight for effective teacher trainings and make sure that our kids have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6206)|
| 1:43:32| what they need to be able to read well. So, Erin, can you speak to a little bit about the science| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6212)|
| 1:43:37| of reading, if you don't mind, and do you think that this is important? Sure. So the science of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6217)|
| 1:43:42| reading is a convergence of research that talks about what the elements are that lead to effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6222)|
| 1:43:50| literacy instruction. And so one of the simplest ways to look at that is a simple equation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| which is referred to as a simple view of reading, which is taking language comprehension multiplied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6235)|
| 1:44:01| by decoding, and that equates to reading comprehension. And so if we associate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6241)|
| 1:44:06| with Scarborough's Rope, which is something that's often referred to when we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6246)|
| 1:44:11| the science of reading, there are essentially two ends to that rope. The bottom end of that rope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6251)|
| 1:44:18| is about word recognition. And so when we teach students to recognize words, that's when we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| using explicit direct instruction around phonological awareness, which I spoke about on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6263)|
| 1:44:29| Monday, which is that big umbrella. We break it down to the phoneme level, which is the smallest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6269)|
| 1:44:33| unit of sound in the language. We're also teaching students how to blend sounds together with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6273)|
| 1:44:40| explicit instruction and how to build their fluency capacity. And so we're also teaching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6280)|
| 1:44:47| sight word recognition as part of that word recognition part of the rope. That bottom part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6287)|
| 1:44:54| of the rope is what we hope and what we strive for in all of our explicit direct instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6294)|
| 1:45:01| for students to master. Those are what we refer to as constrained skills. So in order to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6301)|
| 1:45:07| effectively employ those skills, you have to master them. The top part of Scarborough's Rope is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6307)|
| 1:45:13| referred to from the language comprehension side of things. That's when we look at things like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6313)|
| 1:45:19| vocabulary, building up our knowledge of how do words speak to the meaning part of language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6319)|
| 1:45:29| And so we're looking carefully at the elements of reading comprehension. When we think about literacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6329)|
| 1:45:34| as an all-encompassing thing, you can also refer to the Tennessee academic standards to get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6334)|
| 1:45:39| picture of what that looks like. So our Tennessee academic standards call for literate students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6339)|
| 1:45:45| to have foundational literacy instruction. So we have that FL code in our standards that speaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6345)|
| 1:45:53| to foundational literacy. We have speaking and listening standards. So we want to build literate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6353)|
| 1:45:58| students who are well spoken and have the ability to listen well and comprehend what they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6358)|
| 1:46:05| listening to. We also have reading standards. So the ability to engage with complex text and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6365)|
| 1:46:11| meaning from those texts. And then we have writing standards. So how do we convey meaning in how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6371)|
| 1:46:18| have written communication. Thank you. And I know that the state passed a literacy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6378)|
| 1:46:25| package recently. And so for me, this supports what the state is doing. It supports one of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6385)|
| 1:46:35| superintendent's main priorities. And I also look at the legislative priorities. I look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6395)|
| 1:46:41| document as something that embodies what this board deems important, but also the values of Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6401)|
| 1:46:48| County. I think that this should always be a working document. I think it should be a changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6408)|
| 1:46:52| document. I would love to see at the end of the year, what did we accomplish on our legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6412)|
| 1:46:58| priorities? What went well? What didn't go well? I would just love to see this document kind of grow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6418)|
| 1:47:03| from where it is. And I would like to bring this up as I'm going to make a motion to add this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6423)|
| 1:47:09| because I just think it's important to add literacy to this, especially since the state is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6429)|
| 1:47:17| focusing on this and our superintendent is focusing on this and his priorities. Thank you, Dr. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6437)|
| 1:47:22| Thank you, Ms. Thorne. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6442)|
| 1:47:29| Ms. Owen, I appreciate you adding under, I'm looking at the section under funding public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6449)|
| 1:47:33| education, and I appreciate you adding the point about their recent attention to funding the needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6453)|
| 1:47:39| and et cetera. However, after our conversation on Monday and just really kind of the way it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6459)|
| 1:47:46| hit me to continue to include this section on the legislative priorities, I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6466)|
| 1:47:54| they've addressed this in such a big way last year. I don't think they're going to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6474)|
| 1:47:59| and do anything this year. So to Ms. Henderson's point about this being a living document, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6479)|
| 1:48:05| doesn't mean that we won't need to come back and add something next year, but they're not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6485)|
| 1:48:10| add anything. I don't think they're going to add anything this year. They've added $1 billion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6490)|
| 1:48:16| to education, an additional $52 to $54 million for KCS. I don't think that, I'm not sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6496)|
| 1:48:25| including this at this point will add to our credibility with the legislature. So that I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6505)|
| 1:48:32| like to hear from some other board members, but that's my feeling on it. That was my gut feeling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6512)|
| 1:48:37| on Monday, and as I've thought about it this week, that is kind of my position. So I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6517)|
| 1:48:44| if we need to create some space on this document, I would be in favor of deleting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6524)|
| 1:48:49| and I don't, you know, we can revisit it next year to see if we need to add anything back in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6529)|
| 1:48:56| The reason I feel strongly about keeping it in is because they are still in rulemaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6536)|
| 1:49:01| and rulemaking is where much of the funding decisions will be made about where to put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6541)|
| 1:49:09| different pieces of those funding formulas. So my concern is that the Department of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6549)|
| 1:49:18| during rulemaking could make adjustments there, and we need to be sure that our legislature is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6558)|
| 1:49:27| keeping an eye on that, I guess, so that we continue with these expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6567)|
| 1:49:35| Perhaps we need to adjust the language then to reflect that even more. I'm not sure, but I see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6575)|
| 1:49:48| your point. I'm just concerned that it's going to appear like we don't think they've heard us in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6588)|
| 1:49:56| past. I'm thinking about the Finance Committee, Finance Ways and Means, and they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6596)|
| 1:50:11| great reservations about moving forward with it. However, they talked a lot about being able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6611)|
| 1:50:20| make adjustments during this session, so I really feel like we need to keep this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6620)|
| 1:50:27| in front of them to be sure that they are making those considerations as they're making adjustments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6627)|
| 1:50:33| to law. Just to speak a little bit to what you are saying, Ms. Warren, I do think that it can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6633)|
| 1:50:43| be problematic if what we send doesn't recognize what's already been done, I guess, and that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6643)|
| 1:50:50| be what you're trying to say, right? I don't want it to give the appearance of, well, Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6650)|
| 1:50:55| doesn't even know that we dedicate it yet. Right. Could we take the last sentence in the top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6655)|
| 1:51:02| paragraph and move it to the top of the paragraph? Would that help if the appreciation for their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6662)|
| 1:51:06| recent attention to funding needs began that section? Or maybe even, I mean, the headline is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6666)|
| 1:51:12| funding for public education. I think we might ought to speak more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6672)|
| 1:51:19| TESA, you know, its specific rulemaking around TESA, so perhaps something that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6679)|
| 1:51:27| more targeted to what your point is about where dollars are allocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6687)|
| 1:51:36| My concern would be in getting that completed before we have our lunch with legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6696)|
| 1:51:42| Yeah. I mean, I guess I'd like to hear from some other board members about what,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6702)|
| 1:51:49| about your thoughts about this section in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6709)|
| 1:51:55| And I'll also add, I mean, I don't feel all that strongly about adding another page if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6715)|
| 1:52:04| we need to. I mean, that's not a hard line in the sand for me. I mean, if it comes to that and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6724)|
| 1:52:09| need to add another page, I'm okay with that. Ms. Byke. Thank you, Madam Chair. I think this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6729)|
| 1:52:18| sounds really great, and I, and the amendment too, and I agree that this should be a living document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6738)|
| 1:52:24| I maybe would just like some more clarity on, like, it seems like a lot of this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6744)|
| 1:52:31| you know, asking for things and asking for intention, and I'm not really sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6751)|
| 1:52:35| exactly what this is asking for. And then also, what Knox County might, where the gaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6755)|
| 1:52:45| for Knox County would be that this would help fill. Does that make sense? The second amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6765)|
| 1:52:51| Yeah. Yeah. In my mind, the legislative priorities, and I'm not going to speak to Steve's amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6771)|
| 1:52:58| but they kind of go along with parental transparency. To me, the legislative priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6778)|
| 1:53:05| is a document, and we always ask, ask, ask. But we also need to show, hey, this is what we value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6785)|
| 1:53:13| for our students. This is what we value for Knox County, and this is what we value in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6793)|
| 1:53:19| And these are our priorities, and so that's where I'm coming from with those. These are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6799)|
| 1:53:23| statements of this is what's important to us. So just more clarity on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6803)|
| 1:53:31| Is there any sort, so it's just a statement of these are where our values are. There isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6811)|
| 1:53:36| an ask there of legislature or for anything for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6816)|
| 1:53:41| So the state passed a literacy package last year, Read 360, that's based, that's phonics-based,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6821)|
| 1:53:48| and so it just supports their work that they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6828)|
| 1:53:52| to make sure that our students are ready for a world after graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6832)|
| 1:54:03| I think the purpose of this document is to ask, ask, ask. That's what it's for. It's to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6843)|
| 1:54:11| our legislators and say, this is what we want. This is what we need. It's supposed to be an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6851)|
| 1:54:17| ask, ask, ask document. It's supposed to let them know, here are our needs. I think if we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6857)|
| 1:54:25| express appreciation when they have created something, that's something we might want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6865)|
| 1:54:32| do through resolution. Because this is what we are, these are our asks for this session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6872)|
| 1:54:39| or well, for this half of the session. So is it legislative asks or legislative priorities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6879)|
| 1:54:47| I think it's balanced. Sometimes they're called legislative agendas, sometimes they're called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6887)|
| 1:54:51| priorities, but these are our priorities for what we want our legislators to do. So we don't value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6891)|
| 1:54:57| reading or supporting the state in those efforts? I just think there's a balance. I think you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6897)|
| 1:55:01| talking about a position statement instead of a legislative. It's a priority for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6901)|
| 1:55:08| and we can vote on it. It either will pass or not pass. That's why I'm just bringing it to the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6908)|
| 1:55:12| and I'll do whatever, you know, obviously it's the board's will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6912)|
| 1:55:16| But I think it should be a balanced document, a working document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6916)|
| 1:55:20| Is there an ask we can put with this? I mean, it seems like there are needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6920)|
| 1:55:27| with reading. I mean, obviously that's been the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| We need to, I think Mr. Watson, I believe you are next up here, or you haven't spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6929)|
| 1:55:37| Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to appreciate all the work that's gone into this and appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6937)|
| 1:55:43| those that brought ideas and suggestions to the table. I think it's important that whenever we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6943)|
| 1:55:50| communicating the desires for Knox County Schools that we're also conscious of the changing landscape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6950)|
| 1:55:57| that Knox County Schools resides in. And I think that speaks some to what Ms. Horne is saying that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6957)|
| 1:56:02| I know since I came on the board, there was something very similar around funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| the whole time. And then, you know, TISA happened and some people love it, some people hate it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6966)|
| 1:56:12| and probably nobody's completely happy, right? But then there's also, to me in some ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6972)|
| 1:56:18| Ms. Henderson, I understand what you're saying, but I think the literacy instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6978)|
| 1:56:21| falls in the same category and that, like you just said, they passed literacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6981)|
| 1:56:26| I have 360, what's the full name? Yeah, re360, right? So I guess what I'm, I know this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6986)|
| 1:56:33| probably throwing a wrench in it and I'm not suggesting that we do this and take all this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6993)|
| 1:56:37| but I do think it's important for us in the future as we're drafting this is to maybe maximize the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=6997)|
| 1:56:46| use of this where we are really trying to push the envelope on things that have not been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7006)|
| 1:56:52| To me, to spend the time to reaffirm in legislative priorities or legislative agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7012)|
| 1:56:58| things that have already been done, I'm not sure that's the best use of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7018)|
| 1:57:05| this tool and this opportunity to be in the ears of our legislators. And I do think there's a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7025)|
| 1:57:10| of ways to acknowledge them and I appreciate your comments around balance. I mean, I don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7030)|
| 1:57:15| our legislators to think that we don't appreciate them. But I think, as you said, this is a living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7035)|
| 1:57:20| document and I think it should acknowledge the changing landscape. And so, to me, if any year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7040)|
| 1:57:27| we're just putting things on there that have already been done and already been addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7047)|
| 1:57:31| and tackled, I'm not sure that's, I'm not sure that's really honoring the intent of what a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7051)|
| 1:57:37| legislative priority list should be. Because the reality is we're never going to get completely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7057)|
| 1:57:43| what we feel like we need for Knox County Schools. That's just not the nature of the beast, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7063)|
| 1:57:48| And so, there's always something new to try to push for. And to me, I think that's probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7068)|
| 1:57:53| where the best use of this tool is, is to really dig in and say, well, what are those things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7073)|
| 1:57:59| we need to be pushing for? Not that I don't want to thank people for things that they've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7079)|
| 1:58:03| I just think there's probably other avenues to do that. So, in some ways, I kind of feel the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7083)|
| 1:58:08| funding for public education section, the way it's worded, I completely understand Ms. Horne's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7088)|
| 1:58:13| concerns about rules, but I don't think it's worded to really make that statement. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7093)|
| 1:58:17| it does more drift into what Ms. Horne was saying, that it's kind of restating things that have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7097)|
| 1:58:22| addressed. And also, the literacy instruction, I think both those things kind of fall into those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7102)|
| 1:58:26| categories of things the legislature's tackled. And we probably should move on to it and figure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7106)|
| 1:58:32| out what are the next things that Knox County Schools needs. Mr. Triplett? I agree with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7112)|
| 1:58:40| living, breathing, and I think that maybe in Amendment 3 and Amendment 4 are things they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7120)|
| 1:58:46| tackled recently, and in the following year, you don't bring those up again, but it's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7126)|
| 1:58:50| they've tackled recently and something we support, and I want them to know there's a group of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7130)|
| 1:58:54| in East Tennessee that support those things, so we vote to add them on, and then next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7134)|
| 1:58:58| we take them off. It doesn't have to be the same set of things every year, but we add them for now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7138)|
| 1:59:04| and say, hey, we support some of the decisions you made around literacy and some of these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7144)|
| 1:59:07| and then maybe we change the wording related to funding for public education to lend some support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7147)|
| 1:59:13| to some decisions that they've made, and then next year, those things come off, and maybe there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7153)|
| 1:59:17| some specific asks around literacy, around funding that we want. So I agree that I don't want it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7157)|
| 1:59:25| be all ask, and I certainly don't want it to be all thank you very much and applaud. There are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| some things we need, but I think when there are decisions that are made that we value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7169)|
| 1:59:33| I would like to see those included just for one year to bring support to those things and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7173)|
| 1:59:38| let them know, hey, you made some right decisions, and we appreciate that. We support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| We want you to continue in that direction, and then the following year, those can be moved off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7182)|
| 1:59:48| When I look at years' previous documents, this just doesn't really change. It's almost like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7188)|
| 1:59:52| repeat in a lot of ways, which I understand some of it needs to be a repeat, but I think this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7192)|
| 1:59:58| a way to say, hey, we support some decisions you made. Continue in that direction. The next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7198)|
| 2:00:02| those can kind of come off, and we can move in other directions as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| Thank you. Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7207)|
| 2:00:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7213)|
| 2:00:19| In the paragraph on page one, under the academic retention decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7219)|
| 2:00:23| if we added language that said, if we added from the Tennessee standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7223)|
| 2:00:33| in the last line, materials for reading and foundational literacy and comprehension skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7233)|
| 2:00:46| would that cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7246)|
| 2:00:51| adding that to the language we added before? Would that cover it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7251)|
| 2:00:54| So, you're saying adding that in place of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7254)|
| 2:01:00| No, in addition to evidence-based teacher training and materials for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7260)|
| 2:01:08| reading and foundational literacy instruction and skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7268)|
| 2:01:13| Reading and foundational literacy instruction and skills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7273)|
| 2:01:25| I would like to see a more robust definition, so I would rather see it as how I've written it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7285)|
| 2:01:35| Ms. Horne. Thank you, Madam Chair. I have a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7295)|
| 2:01:39| It sounds like maybe what we need is, perhaps we could have in the final section of this document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7299)|
| 2:01:49| whether it's on page two or a page three, which it looks like it might be a page three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7309)|
| 2:01:53| that it has kind of a separate section that says, Knox County Board of Education appreciates and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7313)|
| 2:01:59| supports, and then lists these four amendments. So, it's acknowledging that there's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7319)|
| 2:02:07| acknowledging that they've already been addressed, and we appreciate and support those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7327)|
| 2:02:14| So, that's kind of what it sounds like to me that would be clearer. And the title of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7334)|
| 2:02:21| it does say priorities. So, it doesn't say agenda, it says priorities. So, that demonstrates that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7341)|
| 2:02:28| these would be priorities. So, and even then as an aside to that, whether we list the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7348)|
| 2:02:39| piece with that, and then list it basically how it is, or then the other suggestion that I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7359)|
| 2:02:47| have for the funding for public education is perhaps just change the title to TESA funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7367)|
| 2:02:54| or something of that nature, delete the first sentence, and say the Board of Education appreciates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7374)|
| 2:03:01| our, Knox County Board of Education appreciates our legislators recent attention to funding needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7381)|
| 2:03:06| and urges the General Assembly to ensure TESA includes, and then have the list. So, that it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7386)|
| 2:03:13| an acknowledgement of just basically a, we understand where we are, and here's what we'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7393)|
| 2:03:19| like to see. I like that idea, and I like the organization of it where it's kind of separate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7399)|
| 2:03:27| a little bit, where it's like here's what we're asking for, here's what we'd like to see, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7407)|
| 2:03:33| here's what we appreciate, and these are the values of our area in our county. So, I like that idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7413)|
| 2:03:41| Are you saying to remove the transparency piece and put that in a separate section? Yes, then we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7421)|
| 2:03:47| could delete that piece and have, and use the language, whatever, whatever Ms., let's see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7427)|
| 2:03:55| amendment one, parents are best equipped, yeah, so, and that basically restates what the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7435)|
| 2:04:02| has already done. So, yes, I would say delete that transparency. Yeah, and then put it in the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7442)|
| 2:04:07| section where we're acknowledging what has been done and appreciate what the legislature has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7447)|
| 2:04:14| already done in the state. So, did we have a, did we have a motion? We, only to, to discuss this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7454)|
| 2:04:31| document, she said that she would, to discuss it, right, that she would be asking for an amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7471)|
| 2:04:36| that has not asked for one. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7476)|
| 2:04:43| So, okay, well then I'll, I mean, do, I don't know who has the floor. I'm wondering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7483)|
| 2:04:54| so, in, in the, here's what I'm thinking, I'm thinking that no, no one in the public has seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7494)|
| 2:05:01| these, so they haven't had an opportunity to discuss them with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7501)|
| 2:05:08| Should we add them next month as an amendment to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7508)|
| 2:05:18| so that we can discuss them further, or should we keep going? Go ahead. I mean, I know my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7518)|
| 2:05:23| these are the things that people are coming to me with every day, so. Well, in some of these, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7523)|
| 2:05:28| we're probably in some of our campaign material, those of us that recently ran. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7528)|
| 2:05:37| Thank you, Madam Chair. Ms. Warren, I do like your suggestion of reorganizing the document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7537)|
| 2:05:41| and I think it, I think it makes it more clear when the, and I, I think it more, makes it more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7541)|
| 2:05:47| clear when legislators looking at it that they see, okay, here's their ask, and here's the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7547)|
| 2:05:51| they're grateful for, and I think that has a better flow of it, instead of mixing it in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7551)|
| 2:05:57| And I, and I do think the, it does help removing that first sentence from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7557)|
| 2:06:03| funding for public education. I'm fine recalling it TESA funding, but really highlighting that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7563)|
| 2:06:08| those are the things we want addressed in the rules, and that is an ask, that is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7568)|
| 2:06:12| that's still in process. I think that's important to probably try to include, so I appreciate your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7572)|
| 2:06:17| suggestion of, of reorganizing. Thank you. All right, so Ms. Horne, or Mr. Triplett, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7577)|
| 2:06:25| So then, can we make a motion then? You got it, go ahead. Okay. Okay, Madam Chair, I'll make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7585)|
| 2:06:31| motion to make the following adjustments to this document. Change the title for funding for public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7591)|
| 2:06:42| education to TESA funding, and delete the first sentence in that section. Then delete the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7602)|
| 2:06:53| transparency section altogether. Add a new title to the last section called Knox County Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7613)|
| 2:07:04| Education appreciates and supports, and then add Amendment 1, Amendment 2, Amendment 3, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7624)|
| 2:07:15| Amendment 4, as presented by Ms. Henderson and Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7635)|
| 2:07:33| So we have a substitute motion to change the heading of funding for public education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7653)|
| 2:07:44| right, to TESA funding. Delete the first sentence, delete the first sentence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7664)|
| 2:07:57| and leave the rest, and then delete the section on transparency, but add the language and a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7677)|
| 2:08:07| heading of Knox County Board of Education appreciates and supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7687)|
| 2:08:18| Okay, and list the four amendments that board members have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7698)|
| 2:08:23| So discussion on that? Ms. Owen. I'm good with all of that until we get down to adding these four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7703)|
| 2:08:32| without any input from the public or from our teachers. I know there's a great deal of concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7712)|
| 2:08:39| over the classroom libraries that are having to be gone through right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7719)|
| 2:08:50| It seems hypocritical to me to talk about transparency and then add supporting these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7730)|
| 2:08:57| things without giving any opportunity for the public to comment on any of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7737)|
| 2:09:03| So that's the concern I would have with adding that additional page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7743)|
| 2:09:10| Mr. Watson. Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7750)|
| 2:09:15| I have a challenge with voting on this with all four amendments automatically included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7755)|
| 2:09:21| I do think three and four are hot-button issues, and I do think there are large swaths of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7761)|
| 2:09:27| community that certainly support what the legislature did with both of those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7767)|
| 2:09:32| but I also know that there's some, I think, unintentional messages that are being sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7772)|
| 2:09:39| The reality is we do have students in our community who are transgender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7779)|
| 2:09:44| and depending on, I don't think it necessarily matters what we view about that personally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7784)|
| 2:09:49| that is the way they identify. And when the legislature does certain things that it did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7789)|
| 2:09:55| whether or not it felt like it was in the right to do that, it does send a message to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7795)|
| 2:09:59| in terms of their value. In terms of amendment four, I actually don't like the way that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7799)|
| 2:10:06| handled what they did. I'm not, I'm certainly not an advocate for explicit voting, but I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7806)|
| 2:10:12| I'm not an advocate for explicit content in our elementary libraries, but the reality is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7812)|
| 2:10:16| was already ways to handle that. They were established, and I think both of those were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7816)|
| 2:10:25| culture war issues that were problems were trying to be addressed that maybe weren't problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7825)|
| 2:10:30| and so I would offer a friendly amendment to the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| and that is that we vote on the amendments themselves separately to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7834)|
| 2:10:42| So we vote for the document first, and then we just vote for amendment one, amendment two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7842)|
| 2:10:54| amendment three. We had one at a time. One at a time. So the motion, your motion, Mr. Watson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7854)|
| 2:11:02| is to vote for the document first with removing transparency and with the removal of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7862)|
| 2:11:08| suggestion, and then a vote for amendment one, amendment two, amendment three, amendment four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7868)|
| 2:11:12| separate, and so one and four may make it, two or three may not, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7872)|
| 2:11:17| Okay. I'm content with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7877)|
| 2:11:18| So Ms. Horn and Ms. Henderson are okay with that friendly amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7878)|
| 2:11:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7883)|
| 2:11:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7883)|
| 2:11:24| So Ms. Spike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-230112?start=7884)|
