| 3:38:11| I'm sure you're familiar with the dozens of Title VII lawsuits that this county has failed to demonstrate that they have standing on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13091)|
| 3:38:23| and we keep losing and losing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13103)|
| 3:38:25| We're going to tack Title IX on top of that with Knox Prep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13105)|
| 3:38:30| One, because the judge is going to look at your own policy that you'll be violating, which states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13110)|
| 3:38:35| all students shall have the same opportunities with regards to programs and activities regardless of race, color, creed, religion, national origin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13115)|
| 3:38:42| sex, or disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13122)|
| 3:38:44| Knox Prep does not provide the same opportunities to girls as it does to boys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13124)|
| 3:38:48| There's no comparable girl school that girls can apply to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13128)|
| 3:38:53| So a judge will look very unfavorably on you there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13133)|
| 3:38:57| And that is clearly spelled out in the application on page 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13137)|
| 3:39:01| And then that third page is the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Education's language about guidelines regarding single-sex classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13141)|
| 3:39:13| And I won't read that full text for you, but what they clearly say is if you offer an all-boys school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13153)|
| 3:39:20| you have to offer an equivalent all-girls school or else you are in violation of Title IX.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13160)|
| 3:39:26| Now, if this board approves Knox Prep by violating your own policy and becoming the overseer of the LEA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13166)|
| 3:39:36| this county is now on the hook for that Title IX lawsuit that will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13176)|
| 3:39:41| And I'm pretty sure your Associated County Commissioners are pretty tired of that getting sucked out of their budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13181)|
| 3:39:47| things that we could use to go pay better teacher salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13187)|
| 3:39:51| We're 100 officers short in the Sheriff's Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13191)|
| 3:39:55| We can't even hire custodians because we can't pay enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13195)|
| 3:40:00| So instead of that money coming out of our county budget, go ahead and let the state commission approve this LEA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13200)|
| 3:40:07| because then it will not be coming out of our budget when they lose that lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13207)|
| 3:40:12| It will be coming out of the state budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13212)|
| 3:40:14| And we can apply those funds to things like, I don't know, Bright Steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13214)|
| 3:40:20| We can apply it to expanding preschool like we just heard about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13220)|
| 3:40:23| which is infinitely more valuable when we start intervention at a child's early stages of life rather than in middle school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13223)|
| 3:40:31| I know this is hard for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13231)|
| 3:40:33| I know this has become a bit political, but Godspeed and thanks for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13233)|
| 3:40:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13239)|
| 3:40:41| David Ling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13241)|
| 3:40:45| He left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13245)|
| 3:40:46| He left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13246)|
| 3:40:47| What about Barbara?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13247)|
| 3:40:48| They left together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13248)|
| 3:40:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13249)|
| 3:40:50| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13250)|
| 3:40:51| She left too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13251)|
| 3:40:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13252)|
| 3:40:53| Sam Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13253)|
| 3:41:00| Thank you very much, Madam Vice Chair, Madam Chair, members of the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13260)|
| 3:41:05| and particularly to my school board representative, Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13265)|
| 3:41:08| Thank you all for the work that you do, and thank you for your time tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13268)|
| 3:41:14| My stand before you was a little not determined on what I wanted to say or what direction I wanted to come from tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13274)|
| 3:41:24| I must say, along with my colleague, I am very impressed with some of the information that has come from Chattanooga Prep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13284)|
| 3:41:35| and certainly the talent displayed and the discipline displayed by this cadre of wonderful young men.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13295)|
| 3:41:45| I stand here as a testament to what Knox County Schools can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13305)|
| 3:41:53| Over 20 years ago, I was just like these young men, going to Selma Green, going to Vine Middle School, going to Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13313)|
| 3:42:05| I, too, had the opportunity to take AP classes in biology, in European history, in Russian, as a matter of fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13325)|
| 3:42:16| I scored four and five on those AP exams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13336)|
| 3:42:20| And Austin East, through their ACT prep, in 2004, was able to score a 20 on the ACT exam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13340)|
| 3:42:29| I have several examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13349)|
| 3:42:31| One of my schoolmates who matriculated through the halls of Austin East with me and the former vice chair of this governing body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13351)|
| 3:42:39| Ms. Evedy-Satterfield, was just admitted to Harvard University in their doctorate of education program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13359)|
| 3:42:44| We have several examples of the successes that can be realized by students that come through our public schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13364)|
| 3:42:53| when they are funded by us to the best of our ability and capacity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13373)|
| 3:42:58| and also have persons from our community shaping and molding those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13378)|
| 3:43:04| I see this as low-hanging fruit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13384)|
| 3:43:07| While some may perceive this as a solution that will extend opportunities to some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13387)|
| 3:43:12| the vast majority of the students they say they're trying to reach will not be impacted by this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13392)|
| 3:43:18| Also, one thing that I found very disheartening is their attempt to omit data from their application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13398)|
| 3:43:27| knowing the law that constrains or that confines the application review committee of being limited in what they're able to make their decisions on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13407)|
| 3:43:38| I empathize with you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13418)|
| 3:43:40| I know that the deck is stacked and your hands are really tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13420)|
| 3:43:43| Whether we like it or not, this school is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13423)|
| 3:43:47| And so one thing I want to say that I think is very concerning and is very telling to their culture and their ethics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13427)|
| 3:43:55| is how can we on the front end begin to consider and look for loopholes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13435)|
| 3:44:00| in a Title IX policy that was really intended to ensure equity for all of our students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13440)|
| 3:44:06| Is that really the foot we want to start off on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13446)|
| 3:44:09| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13449)|
| 3:44:11| Madam Chair, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13451)|
| 3:44:15| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13455)|
| 3:44:17| So moving on to board forum, Ms. Steggert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13457)|
| 3:44:22| Dr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13462)|
| 3:44:30| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13470)|
| 3:44:32| Thank you, Madam Chair and technician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13472)|
| 3:44:38| I say with heavy heart that the school shooting in Nashville brought to my mind that two years ago, I believe it was April 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13478)|
| 3:44:56| the death of Anthony Thompson at Austin East High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13496)|
| 3:45:01| And what comes to mind sometimes is how soon we forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13501)|
| 3:45:07| But I know a mother and a sister, a family, a school, a community that have not forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13507)|
| 3:45:17| And the tragedy is, around that is, is that sometimes I don't think that we really looked at what we needed to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13517)|
| 3:45:24| so it wouldn't have happened so that we make sure it doesn't happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13524)|
| 3:45:29| But we continue to be in prayer for that family and all families who have suffered violence at school where they should feel the most safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13529)|
| 3:45:42| Miss Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13542)|
| 3:45:44| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13544)|
| 3:45:46| Miss Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13546)|
| 3:45:47| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13547)|
| 3:45:48| I just wanted to address the incidents that happened at Hardin Valley Academy last week and just kind of respond to Dr. Rice with remarks earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13548)|
| 3:45:56| First of all, Dr. Rice, I'm grateful to hear that you understand the severity of the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13556)|
| 3:46:01| And I also want to thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13561)|
| 3:46:03| Dr. Rice was out at Hardin Valley Academy with his team all Thursday afternoon and all day Friday speaking to students, speaking to teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13563)|
| 3:46:11| So thank you for your extraordinary leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13571)|
| 3:46:14| We really do appreciate you and we're grateful for you and your team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13574)|
| 3:46:17| I know we're in the same boat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13577)|
| 3:46:19| We both heard from lots of community members, lots of parents who were concerned not only about the incident, but also how it was handled at the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13579)|
| 3:46:28| So thank you for taking charge of the next steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13588)|
| 3:46:31| I'm hopeful to see significant improvements and transparencies, which will hopefully lead to changes to ensure our school safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13591)|
| 3:46:38| So thank you for your leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13598)|
| 3:46:41| Miss Byne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13601)|
| 3:46:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13603)|
| 3:46:47| Echoing what everyone else said and remembering those things and issues and making sure to not forget them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13607)|
| 3:46:55| And, you know, even a week out that we continue to remember things and also appreciation for Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13615)|
| 3:47:03| Rice, Wick and all the work that he's done, even on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13623)|
| 3:47:07| I know that I get text messages late at night to the whole board that he is working hard on all of this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13627)|
| 3:47:13| And also to Chief Perriard, who had a very lengthy conversation with me last Tuesday so that I could help some of my constituents to feel better about what Knox County Schools is doing for school security and that we are taking it very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13633)|
| 3:47:28| And then hop skipping on a completely different topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13648)|
| 3:47:33| I worked for Starbucks from 2004 to 2008 and was one of the people that they sent to Cookville to open those stores and all the stores in this region in the big boom before 2008 happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13653)|
| 3:47:46| And so I definitely know that selling coffee is not the same as educating children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13666)|
| 3:47:51| And I'm so glad I don't work at Starbucks anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13671)|
| 3:47:56| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13676)|
| 3:47:57| Yeah, a couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13677)|
| 3:47:58| Appreciate the students who spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13678)|
| 3:47:59| They did a great job and hope you enjoy the rest of your spring break and proud to stand with students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13679)|
| 3:48:04| And then I just want to give a shout out, which I should have done last month, but to the halls high school wrestling team won two state titles this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13684)|
| 3:48:10| So we'll end on a more lighthearted and celebratory note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13690)|
| 3:48:13| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13693)|
| 3:48:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13694)|
| 3:48:15| And yes, to our Chattanooga prep students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13695)|
| 3:48:19| Thank you for your patience with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13699)|
| 3:48:21| You are very impressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13701)|
| 3:48:22| I hope you get a really good meal tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13702)|
| 3:48:26| I don't know where that'll be, but I'm sure you'll find somewhere good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13706)|
| 3:48:31| And just quickly a shout out to our Southville High School robotics team for going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230403?start=13711)|
