| 0:02:03| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=123)|
| 0:02:05| For the mayor's report tonight, I first want to hope that everybody had a great Memorial Day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=125)|
| 0:02:12| and that we all remembered those who paid the ultimate price to secure our freedom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| We all benefit from that sacrifice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=137)|
| 0:02:19| And so while we enjoyed the day off from work and enjoyed spending time with family and friends,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=139)|
| 0:02:24| I hope we all did take a moment to remember really what that day is set aside for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| Also this past weekend, we lost a very dear, dear friend, a dedicated leader,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=149)|
| 0:02:35| and I'm talking about Barbara Monte, who had just retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| In fact, just last month she was here, and we honored her 45 years of service to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=159)|
| 0:02:46| and specifically to CAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| You all know that she helped, she really founded Mobile Meals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=168)|
| 0:02:52| and CAC named the Mobile Meals kitchen after her in her honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=172)|
| 0:02:59| And this past weekend she passed away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=179)|
| 0:03:02| So I just, our hearts go out to her family and to all of her friends and coworkers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| because we all love Barbara deeply, and it's just a tragedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=188)|
| 0:03:16| I also want to announce a public process that will be underway in just a few weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=196)|
| 0:03:21| for an updated master plan for Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=201)|
| 0:03:25| As you all know, the city will inherit an additional 61 acres from the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| as a result of the closing of Lakeshore Mental Health Institute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| So this process, the public process, will be led by the city along with the board of Lakeshore Park, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=214)|
| 0:03:42| which is the nonprofit that helps develop and manage the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=222)|
| 0:03:46| So we will be holding the first in a series of opportunities for feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| This will be a public meeting at 6 p.m. on Monday, June 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| And a press release went out this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| I don't know if you saw it before you came here, but 6 p.m. Monday, June 10th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| in the gymnasium at Sacred Heart Cathedral on North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=244)|
| 0:04:09| We're calling this Lakeshore Park Next Steps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=249)|
| 0:04:12| and we encourage everyone to come out and participate in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=252)|
| 0:04:16| Again, the meeting on June 10th is just the first opportunity in updating the master plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=256)|
| 0:04:22| and we'll be announcing websites and different ways to have your input on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=262)|
| 0:04:30| And also I just want to again recognize that tonight is the last meeting for Mr. Eddie Maness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=270)|
| 0:04:38| Before he assumes the prestigious unpaid position of senior advisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=278)|
| 0:04:46| He has a big smile, doesn't he?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=286)|
| 0:04:48| Yeah, I know. Look at how big that smile is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=288)|
| 0:04:51| Anyway, he's hoping that in his honor the meeting will move swiftly, but he's going to miss us, we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=291)|
| 0:04:58| But we will definitely miss him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=298)|
| 0:05:00| And again, publicly, I want to thank Eddie Maness for the year and a half that he,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| actually more than a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| He actually started work about a month and a half before I did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=306)|
| 0:05:09| because as soon as he agreed he started going in and working to get acclimated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| So certainly appreciate all the leadership that he provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| I know he will continue to be a friend and advisor to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=317)|
| 0:05:22| Of course, Christy Branscom sitting right next to him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=322)|
| 0:05:25| she will move up into that role as deputy to the mayor and chief operating officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| So let's give Eddie a round of applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| Applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=334)|
| 0:05:49| We'll miss you, Eddie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| Okay, that's the end of my report, council reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=357)|
| 0:05:58| Yes, Mayor, I just wanted to note the passing of Mr. James Robinson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| who was a great educator in this city and one of my teachers at Austin High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=362)|
| 0:06:08| And certainly our prayers and thoughts go out to his family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| He was certainly, again, a very involved person in so many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=373)|
| 0:06:18| I know he was in the empowerment zone as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| involved with the Center for Neighborhood Development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=381)|
| 0:06:26| some of those CAC boards, lots of ways that he was actively involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=386)|
| 0:06:30| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=391)|
| 0:06:32| Councilman Saunders and I met with David Watson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=392)|
| 0:06:35| and Leslie Fawes from the East Tennessee Community Design Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=395)|
| 0:06:39| to take a look at some ways that we can help redevelop neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=399)|
| 0:06:43| I know that we tabled some time ago, and this is kind of a follow-up to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=403)|
| 0:06:48| the concept of courtyards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| And so Councilman Saunders and I have explored a book called Pocket Neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| and so we have asked the East Tennessee Design Center to take a look at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| and they've agreed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=420)|
| 0:07:02| They have five points that they're going to follow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=422)|
| 0:07:05| and what I will do is post this on the council forum website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=425)|
| 0:07:10| and then a separate copy to each council member and to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=430)|
| 0:07:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=433)|
| 0:07:14| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=434)|
| 0:07:15| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=436)|
| 0:07:17| I wanted to turn everybody's attention to a couple of events coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| The East Tennessee Children's Hospital is hosting an advocacy committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=441)|
| 0:07:25| for the Knoxville Coalition on Childhood Obesity coming up this Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| from 2.30 to 3.30 at New Harvest Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=450)|
| 0:07:33| So I invite everybody to come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=453)|
| 0:07:34| It's an introduced coalition to work that's been going on to promote healthy lifestyles for children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| And I've got some contact info on that if anybody wants more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| And also I'm going to be riding in the Tour de Cure, not this coming Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=462)|
| 0:07:47| but next Saturday I'll be doing 25 miles, not 100 like George might do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=467)|
| 0:07:52| But I invite everyone to support that Diabetes Association event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| I'll need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| Any others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=482)|
| 0:08:04| Okay, moving right along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| 9A is an ordinance making and fixing the annual appropriations for the several departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=486)|
| 0:08:11| agencies, and funds of the City of Knoxville for the fiscal period beginning July 1, 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=491)|
| 0:08:16| and ending June 30, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=499)|
| 0:08:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| All in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| Councilman Della Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| I'm not sure whether my comments pertain to this particular ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| or the later one that deals with the capital program and budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=509)|
| 0:08:33| But I guess the only concern I have about the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| which was finely honed in trying to live within our means,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| and I thought you did a great job with your staff on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| is I still shrink a little bit on the thought of borrowing $31 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| and the added debt service that's going to put on the city without some knowledge of how we're going to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=528)|
| 0:08:55| some of the growing bills like in pension and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| I understand from Jim York, who may be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=538)|
| 0:09:01| that we still would have to act separately on any bond issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=541)|
| 0:09:07| So, Jim, if you would step forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=547)|
| 0:09:09| And while you're coming up, I don't quarrel that all the things that are proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=549)|
| 0:09:13| are certainly things that would benefit the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=553)|
| 0:09:16| I certainly think that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| I just have that conservative nickel-pinching sense about me that I hate to see extra debt if we could avoid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=557)|
| 0:09:25| Go ahead, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=565)|
| 0:09:27| Tell me about it and whether we're going to approve it separately as it actually comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| Jim York, finance director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| Any debt prior to issuance has to come back before council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| What you're agreeing to here is, again, a budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| and that will be the concept of borrowing $31.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=582)|
| 0:09:46| But every single debt issue, no matter how we do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| will have to come back before council at that time, and we'll have further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=591)|
| 0:09:55| If I could ask, is it possible that this would come up in tranches less than the full amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| or would you do it all as one big issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=601)|
| 0:10:03| It is very possible that this will come up in tranches, again, as we process through everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=603)|
| 0:10:10| We still have a lot of timing to work through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=610)|
| 0:10:13| We clearly do not want to borrow prior to any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| You don't want to borrow too soon, right, because you're paying interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=619)|
| 0:10:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=621)|
| 0:10:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=622)|
| 0:10:23| Well, thank you for that explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=623)|
| 0:10:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| Hold on while he's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| Vice Mayor Fabulous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| I think that's a lot of money to be tossed around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=629)|
| 0:10:32| so if you could just briefly go through what this will represent, what it's being funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| The $31.4 million, at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=639)|
| 0:10:43| we estimate that the annual debt service would be roughly around $2.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| These proceeds will be reused for a new public service complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| That's $15 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=654)|
| 0:10:56| $10 million for basically a capital plan at the Knoxville Zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=656)|
| 0:11:03| We have $5.2 million for Lakeshore Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=663)|
| 0:11:08| And, again, the mayor just mentioned earlier you'll be starting the master planning of that here shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=668)|
| 0:11:15| And, finally, we have $1.2 million for improvements at Prosser Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=675)|
| 0:11:21| And that, again, totals $31.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=681)|
| 0:11:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=686)|
| 0:11:27| Do you have a question again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=687)|
| 0:11:28| No, I'm just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=690)|
| 0:11:31| Are we at that point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| Is that this motion that's before us is to talk about the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| The budget, mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| And the capital improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| We can, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| We can, I guess, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| Yeah, go right ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| I, too, think it's a good plan, a well-thought-out plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| And I think we talked about it at the hearings about the possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| And I guess, to go back to Jim York, I mean, about the possibility of adding to that if we want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=716)|
| 0:12:01| But we're saying for these projects that he just mentioned that we're funding those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=721)|
| 0:12:07| It's automatic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| Those will be funded in accordance to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=729)|
| 0:12:13| If we want to add to that or other projects want to be added to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| can that be considered before we go to the bond or before we go to the market for the bond issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=736)|
| 0:12:24| I'll let Jim address that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=744)|
| 0:12:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Prior, clearly, you know, the budget could be amended prior to any debt issuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=752)|
| 0:12:42| And up until the point that we actually, you know, bring in what we call an initial resolution to council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=762)|
| 0:12:49| that's kind of the first step in the debt issuance process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| Those numbers can and will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| I fully expect that as we refine these numbers, they may change slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=777)|
| 0:13:02| But up until that time, we can change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=782)|
| 0:13:05| Now, once that resolution goes, things really start to tie down very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| When do you think you'll have that resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| Well, again, my expectation is that we will not, probably not need the money for at least six to nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=793)|
| 0:13:21| So, in fact, it's very possible that we probably may not go to the market until a year from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=801)|
| 0:13:28| But, again, part of that depends on the timing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| We know that it's going to take a while to get the public service complex in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=812)|
| 0:13:38| And, again, our philosophy is not to borrow before we have to because we don't want to pay interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=818)|
| 0:13:45| It's been eight years since we borrowed money, and money is cheap today as it is at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=825)|
| 0:13:51| And it appears to me that now is a good time to do that and consider any projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| And I hope that we will take the time over the next six to nine months, council, to vet this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=835)|
| 0:14:01| and look at if there are anything else that we want to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| And maybe there are other projects or maybe there are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| But I think that now is the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| We haven't done a bond issue in eight months or eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=851)|
| 0:14:14| and now is the time to really make sure that we have it and get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| So I think what you presented is well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| I just want to make sure we talk about it and make sure that we think that's the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=861)|
| 0:14:25| Maybe there's something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=869)|
| 0:14:30| Ten billion dollars of that money is going for capital improvements at the Knoxville Zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=870)|
| 0:14:35| This is probably one of the most undervalued assets in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| The zoo generates about $25 million a year in revenue for this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| And with these improvements, that amount could go up to $100 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| So when you figure that $10 million for these capital improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| that would include the new Tiger Walk, a new herpetology center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=894)|
| 0:14:58| and some improvements to Kids Cove, that would be a real bang on that buck for the bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=898)|
| 0:15:04| And, obviously, Prosser Road, and I know that Daniel Brown gets calls about Prosser Road often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=904)|
| 0:15:11| I get them, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=911)|
| 0:15:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| We all do, I guess, about Prosser Road, because that is a huge concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=914)|
| 0:15:18| And, of course, the public service works group, they really need something that's a little bit better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=918)|
| 0:15:25| So I think that this is a good use of our money, and I'm certainly supporting it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=925)|
| 0:15:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| Councilman Delevapi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| Yeah, I just wanted to double check on something that George mentioned early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=932)|
| 0:15:37| As I understand it, George, we've got a six-year horizon capital program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=937)|
| 0:15:42| and this one-year capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=942)|
| 0:15:44| And the fact that we authorize it doesn't necessarily mean, in my mind, that we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=944)|
| 0:15:49| But it's approved in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| It's ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| But if for some reason there are changes in circumstances, I assume we cannot issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=953)|
| 0:15:58| decide not to issue a bond for a certain amount or whatever and have that second look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| Jim, is that correct, or am I missing something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=963)|
| 0:16:06| We're authorizing it, but we're not putting it in gear, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| We've just started the engine and we're idling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| Again, what the budget does is it appropriates funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=973)|
| 0:16:17| and that authorizes us to spend up to what council appropriates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| But it's the up-to part I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| It's the up-to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| Again, for those people who have been around me a long time, we try and keep that up-to a lot lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=984)|
| 0:16:32| Up-to if we have to is kind of a, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=992)|
| 0:16:35| But, again, you know, the philosophy is not to borrow until you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| and not to borrow any more than you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| So we're authorizing it, but we're not kicking it in gear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1003)|
| 0:16:46| We are authorizing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| And, obviously, council experiences lots of things that come before you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| and this is kind of like the first step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| Clearly, projects on Prosser Road, because of the size,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| are going to have to come back to council for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1020)|
| 0:17:02| So, you know, there are lots of steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| This is not just you do this and everything falls into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1024)|
| 0:17:07| There are constantly things that come before council to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| and the same thing with bond issues as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1031)|
| 0:17:13| Thank you for the explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1033)|
| 0:17:16| I want to just thank council because you have taken a lot of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1036)|
| 0:17:22| I appreciate the due diligence, the analysis you've done on this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| And, you know, Councilman Wallace and I were talking the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1047)|
| 0:17:31| and we spent hours in meetings just with staff and going through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1051)|
| 0:17:35| and debating what we should bring forth, what we should wait on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1055)|
| 0:17:40| And so I appreciate that you all took the time to also do that kind of analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| Remember that when there are opportunities, we bring them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| We did it this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| You know, we recommended a couple of the TVA Garage, the University Commons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| You know, there are projects that sometimes arise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| and that's why you want to have a good fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| You want to have, you know, sometimes the TIFs will allow us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| to take advantage of some opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1084)|
| 0:18:06| So we do constantly look for those kinds of investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| that we think will have a good return on them so that it's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1090)|
| 0:18:14| and when we see them, we don't hesitate to bring them to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| if we think it's really a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| But right at this point, we think this is the best option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| and that's why we're recommending this to you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1103)|
| 0:18:25| But we will continue to work with you throughout the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1105)|
| 0:18:27| and as opportunities arise, figure out the best way to take advantage of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1111)|
| 0:18:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1112)|
| 0:18:33| I know you and I have had discussions about this also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| but I just wanted to alert the Council that I have a relative who works at the zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1115)|
| 0:18:42| and it was recommended that I at least acknowledge that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| because the facilities that are going to be built| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1125)|
| 0:18:47| are ones that she's going to be in charge of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1127)|
| 0:18:49| So I just want to go on record to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1129)|
| 0:18:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| Of course, we're taking a tiger due, and you'll be good, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1132)|
| 0:18:55| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| I'm going to go back to Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1136)|
| 0:18:58| I mean, we're – it's your other – there will be other meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| and other votes for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| But we're committed to that $31 million, to those projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1144)|
| 0:19:07| unlike the other stuff that's on the six-year plan that you made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1147)|
| 0:19:11| You're funding pending other approval, but you're funding the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1151)|
| 0:19:15| You're funding that deal tonight with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1155)|
| 0:19:18| I mean, you're saying you're voting for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1158)|
| 0:19:20| You're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| You may have other steps along the way, but we're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| Unlike some of the other stuff that's on the six-year capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1166)|
| 0:19:29| that's still out there, it's unfunded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| We're saying we're funding it tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| That's the way I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| I mean, it's subject to other – you've got other votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| I mean, with the vote tonight that says I'm approving this bond issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1178)|
| 0:19:44| and going to the bond market and all that, it may be a year from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| but we're saying, hey, the zoo's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| The zoo thinks they're getting – they're being funded at tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| So I don't know that you and I quite agree on that, but that's –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| I mean, that's the way I see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| I mean, is that the way you see it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| Well, what I would say is that when it came down to say we had a separate bond issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| for the zoo, and we'd want to look at their capital expenditure plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| and maybe they really only have the capacity to do half of that in the first year or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| and half of it in the second period or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1217)|
| 0:20:21| I would think we would want to be as careful as we can to limit our what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1221)|
| 0:20:29| Taking on debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1229)|
| 0:20:31| Debt is a burden for the city, for the taxpayers, and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1231)|
| 0:20:35| It's going to affect our tax rate if there are other circumstances going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1235)|
| 0:20:38| But I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| It's in the year where it's authorized, but I still think they have to come back to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1239)|
| 0:20:44| and make the case again when they ask for the dollars, and I'm not going to give that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1244)|
| 0:20:52| But I appreciate your point of view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1255)|

| 0:22:29| Okay, Council, we have several people signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| I just want to remind people in the audience what the Council rules are that I am obliged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1351)|
| 0:22:38| to uphold here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| Each side will have up to three speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1360)|
| 0:22:43| Each can speak up to five minutes each, and it's my job to keep track, so I'll tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1363)|
| 0:22:47| when you've got about a minute left and then when your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1367)|
| 0:22:53| And we'll go first for those that are supporting the proposal here, this ordinance, to close,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1373)|
| 0:22:59| and then we'll hear from those who are against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| And I've got three people signed up to speak for it, and they'll be in this order, Terry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1382)|
| 0:23:08| Faulkner, David Kiger, and Tony Capilero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| And so if you want to kind of make your way down, and we'll start with...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| Mayor, before we start, can I ask you something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1399)|
| 0:23:20| I have been asked on a personal basis if we would allow four speakers for the against,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1400)|
| 0:23:28| and I would suggest that we suspend the rules and allow both sides to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1408)|
| 0:23:34| By Council rules, if Council, you can make a motion to suspend the rules and change them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| which right now we have a motion to suspend the rules and allow up to four people, up to five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| minutes each, I presume, for either side?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| Is that what you're...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1428)|
| 0:23:49| It would be wonderful if they could squeeze both presentations into 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1429)|
| 0:23:54| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1434)|
| 0:23:56| But is that the Vice Mayor Pavlis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| Well, and I've heard from other Council members that we really wanted to, you know, we really were elastic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1438)|
| 0:24:06| with that the last time, and there's another feeling amongst Council members that we, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1446)|
| 0:24:12| follow the guidelines that we have set forth to do business by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| I mean, because it's a slippery slope, when do we ever stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| And I don't know what four people could say that three people, and really, in this instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| two people couldn't say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| So, I mean, I just throw that out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1467)|
| 0:24:30| I will certainly bend to the will of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| So Council can decide now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1474)|
| 0:24:36| There's a motion to suspend the rules and allow up to four speakers for each side, up to five minutes each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1476)|
| 0:24:44| preferably fitting it in within 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| You can vote for it or against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1487)|
| 0:24:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| Oh, I need a...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1492)|
| 0:24:53| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| We have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1495)|
| 0:24:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1496)|
| 0:24:57| So, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1498)|
| 0:24:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1499)|
| 0:25:02| Now you have to abstain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1502)|
| 0:25:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| So that did pass with one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| It's up to four people, up to five minutes each.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1511)|
| 0:25:14| So we, Council encourages you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| We had a good long discussion last time, so Council encourages you to try and make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| But I will put five minutes each on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1521)|
| 0:25:23| And when you say time, they should have, like, no more than ten seconds to wrap up and just sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| There is a floor that will drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1528)|
| 0:25:31| And swallow you up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1531)|
| 0:25:32| Really take as much time as you want, but you'll be going under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| So, Ms. Faulkner, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| And I'm going to turn my timer on here for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| I'm checking out the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| I'm Terry Faulkner, 4178 Ridgeway Lane, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| And I'm here representing the Bearden Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1551)|
| 0:25:55| And let me just hold this up in case I forget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1555)|
| 0:25:58| I distributed a few pages from the MPC plan, which are relevant to the issue tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| And I hope that you had a chance to look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| And thank you for the opportunity to speak to this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1567)|
| 0:26:10| Beginning in 1899, before the concepts of green communities and new urbanism became popular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1570)|
| 0:26:17| Bearden community leaders and merchants, with the assistance of local government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| began the work of creating an environmentally sustainable village| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1581)|
| 0:26:25| by improving upon the physical assets available in Bearden at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| And the old timers will remember we had lots of vacant lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| and lots of empty buildings when we started this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1593)|
| 0:26:36| The primary goal of both these concepts is the use of alternative modes of transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1596)|
| 0:26:43| sidewalks, greenways, and bicycle paths to integrate all types of residential housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| with business, schools, restaurants, public transit, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1609)|
| 0:26:53| into a distinctive, more healthy, pleasant urban environment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| in which people can enjoy a good quality of life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| We have sought to do that by improving one of the first early 20th century suburban areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| developed west of downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1626)|
| 0:27:09| In 1999, we realized we need a professional plan, which was supported by local government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1629)|
| 0:27:16| So we worked with MPC staff to create a Bearden Village Opportunities Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| which was passed by MPC and Knoxville City Council in 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1641)|
| 0:27:26| And our community received the first Environmental Achievement Award to be presented by MPC in 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1646)|
| 0:27:34| And much of our plan has been accomplished thanks to our present councilman, Duane Greve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| and a council person who has served us so well for eight years, Barbara Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1661)|
| 0:27:45| Hold up your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1667)|
| 0:27:49| There is more to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1669)|
| 0:27:51| Ensuring the stability of our neighborhoods and adding more quality, good quality, high-density housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| would allow additional residents to enjoy the conveniences and amenities of this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1677)|
| 0:28:02| while diminishing the city's carbon footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| In the last two years, this city council and the Rojero administration have assisted us in the following ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1686)|
| 0:28:12| with pedestrian and land use issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| which will allow more residents and visitors to enjoy the amenities of the Bearden community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1695)|
| 0:28:21| Mann Street was closed so that UT could build a 40-acre intramural athletic field on Sutherland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1701)|
| 0:28:27| Supported in our efforts in this primary commercial district by the university and this administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1707)|
| 0:28:33| a greenway connection, public plaza and parking, crosswalks and additional sidewalks will be completed in 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| enhancing this main street and increasing pedestrian and vehicular safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1720)|
| 0:28:46| Upscale condominiums are being added on property on Sutherland Avenue close to West High,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| which was recently downzoned from industrial to medium-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1731)|
| 0:28:56| The historic Sutherland Heights neighborhood has been rezoned from R2 to R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1736)|
| 0:29:03| Following the suggestions in the MPC plan, these projects on Sutherland Avenue will almost complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1743)|
| 0:29:09| the second of four village centers listed for development in our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1749)|
| 0:29:14| The first center to be completed was a core commercial transportation hub near the Earth Fair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| which features a large cat transfer plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1761)|
| 0:29:24| There is work to be done in the Homburg area, the third designated commercial district in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1764)|
| 0:29:30| due to the lack of walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| The closure of Ben Atchley Street and the large quality development plan by Tony Cappiello| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1773)|
| 0:29:39| that will result from that closure will feature a shopping center, repaired sidewalks to the north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1779)|
| 0:29:46| and new sidewalks on Homburg, which will link the development with surrounding businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1786)|
| 0:29:52| integrating them into a much expanded one-stop pedestrian-friendly shopping area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| You have one minute, Ms. Falk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| The preservation of three existing structures and the addition of markers documenting the lifeways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1799)|
| 0:30:04| in this early industrial area of Bearden will help preserve its character and history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1804)|
| 0:30:09| and make this project a model for other developers in the Homburg district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1809)|
| 0:30:14| It will surely become a popular destination point, benefiting the Bearden community in many ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| and the city as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1819)|
| 0:30:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1822)|
| 0:30:25| Mr. Kiger, please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1825)|
| 0:30:31| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| David Kiger, 5412 Homburg Drive, the Orangery Restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| I appreciate you guys listening to me tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1836)|
| 0:30:40| I think I've kind of rode the fence on this issue for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1840)|
| 0:30:42| because I really wasn't sure what to think about all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| But I've got to say the more I learn about what's going on, the more I absolutely support closing the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| and trying to elevate the image of Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1851)|
| 0:30:55| I think Bearden's been kind of stale for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| and it's had some attempts to try to revitalize this or revitalize that or a new restaurant here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1858)|
| 0:31:03| or a new restaurant there, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1863)|
| 0:31:05| But I think what he's bringing to the table is a huge new image that I think Bearden desperately needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1865)|
| 0:31:14| I think it's a hard decision because I'm friends with people on both sides of this equation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| and I hope that they don't burn me at the stake for speaking in support of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1879)|
| 0:31:24| But what it will bring to this area, I think, is going to be a really big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1884)|
| 0:31:28| And I know the people that say that it will hurt the little guys on the back street, back Homburg Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1888)|
| 0:31:35| and if it hurts them, it will hurt me too, but I just don't see that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| I think a lot of this is being portrayed as the big Wal-Mart that's coming in to squash the little house on the prairie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| and I just don't think that's the case at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1904)|
| 0:31:47| I think it will elevate everything that we're doing in the Bearden area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| and try to pull some of the business back to the Bearden area instead of the Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| So I urge you to support the closing of this street and making anthropology all that it can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Thank you, Mr. Kiger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| Okay, next is Mr. Cappiello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1923)|
| 0:32:11| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| Tony Cappiello, 3004 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| Good evening, Mayor and members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| Since we last met, you all had given me a directive to propose an easement that would allow continued access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1939)|
| 0:32:28| between Homburg Drive and Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| And I've provided a little packet for you this evening that says facts of redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| And on that, you will see behind that first page a proposed easement agreement that we had given to the opposition's attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1956)|
| 0:32:47| Mr. King, last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| There have been a small minor change at the direction of the law director in the city law office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1969)|
| 0:32:58| but just dealing with only respect to the city's obligations with that easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1978)|
| 0:33:08| We have not heard back from the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| I'm sure this evening we will be talking about that further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1990)|
| 0:33:14| The next thing that you will see on the packet that I gave you is I've had a survey done actually of the Ben Ashley right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=1994)|
| 0:33:24| And it is a right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2004)|
| 0:33:27| According to the land surveyor, it is 40 feet in width, approximately 160 feet in length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2007)|
| 0:33:36| With this easement that we are proposing for this redevelopment, we'd be shrinking that to 24 feet in width| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2016)|
| 0:33:43| and keeping pretty much the same width, maybe moving a little bit to the west or to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| Actually, in this case, to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| So with that in mind, the access that we are proposing between Kingston Pike and Homburg Drive will be preserved by this easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2031)|
| 0:34:02| or even by my simple plan design should we not be able to come to an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| I've dedicated the plan to create this easement right-of-way roadway, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2048)|
| 0:34:16| I've heard some issues about the current lines of sight will be compromised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| Actually, by tearing down the backyard burger, pushing the shopping center back to the corner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| it improves the lines of sight for those that are on Homburg Drive that are immediately affected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2066)|
| 0:34:34| There's been some discussion about the turning over of this right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| and I want to stress we have had confirmation by the city that this is an abandonment or closure of a right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2079)|
| 0:34:46| This is not a fee-simple transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| The underlying property owners, which are the two property owners that have the backyard burger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| which is called People's Development Company, and then a trust, are the fee-simple owners of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| It's just the right-of-way that's being abandoned by this closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| I'm not quite sure what that value is, but this is smaller than what the appraisal said, and it's not a fee-simple transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2104)|
| 0:35:13| All in all, this development will improve the property tax base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| It will bring, with anthropology and the tenants that I'm proposing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2118)|
| 0:35:21| will bring significant increase in sales tax to the community, and I'm providing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2121)|
| 0:35:26| and have agreed to provide municipal improvements such as sidewalks, historical markers, lighting, landscaping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2126)|
| 0:35:33| and that's all through my own company's private funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2133)|
| 0:35:37| I'm not asking the city to provide any funds for these sidewalks or any of this extra development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2137)|
| 0:35:45| And then furthermore, as Ms. Faulkner had talked about, the Bearden Village Opportunities Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| this is reflective of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| It is an implementation of pedestrian-friendly atmosphere and community rather than a partialization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2152)|
| 0:35:59| which has occurred because there are so many property owners in the Bearden community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| I'd like to close by simply asking, in the spirit of John King,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2164)|
| 0:36:09| those that support the closure of the roadway, I'd like them to stand this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2169)|
| 0:36:19| These citizens and residents work, play, and live in the Bearden community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2179)|
| 0:36:26| and they're here as stakeholders, and they're here supporting the closure of this right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2186)|
| 0:36:33| They are not my tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2193)|
| 0:36:35| I did ask for friends and neighbors to come and support this closure tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2195)|
| 0:36:43| but they're here in support of the closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2203)|
| 0:36:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| Mr. Seymour, you're down just for a rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| So you all will not have a fourth speaker now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| So now, for those against this ordinance, this is Howard Zoldesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2220)|
| 0:37:08| Did I pronounce that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| Zoldesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| And followed by Ken Holbert and John King and Tom Reckenbach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2235)|
| 0:37:22| My name is Howard Zoldesy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2242)|
| 0:37:25| I am principal broker in Tennessee for Southern Management and Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2245)|
| 0:37:30| We are the landlord representative for Anderson Woodridge Realty Associates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2250)|
| 0:37:34| which owns the Homburg building and the SMD building, and that address is 5410 Homburg Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2254)|
| 0:37:41| This is playing out like a Hollywood script.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| On one hand, you've got a wealthy developer who is very adept at concealing his real motive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2265)|
| 0:37:52| which in my opinion is greed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| He's getting a very valuable piece of real estate for nothing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| and he's getting that to the extreme detriment of the small business owners that are in the Homburg building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2279)|
| 0:38:07| and are in the Southern Market building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| Southern Market has 60-odd vendors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| We've got 25 to 30 tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| They are small business people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| They are the kinds of people, kinds of business people that are being driven from the American landscape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2298)|
| 0:38:25| Why?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2305)|
| 0:38:26| Because of decisions like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| They exist now in the Homburg building and the Southern Market building sharing expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2308)|
| 0:38:34| They can survive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| They're not wealthy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| They work hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| Closing this street, which is a major economic lifeline for them, is going to kill them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2318)|
| 0:38:47| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| Don't listen to any stories that it's not going to affect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| It's going to clobber them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| You're sealing off the main entrance into their section of town, into their businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2333)|
| 0:38:59| The third player in the screenplay is city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2339)|
| 0:39:03| Right now, in my opinion, you're committing an injustice by closing the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2343)|
| 0:39:08| closing a street that belongs to the people of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| It's the economic lifeline for these small businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| and you're giving it to Mr. Capiello at no cost, free of charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2356)|
| 0:39:21| This is an injustice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2361)|
| 0:39:24| To add insult to it, you're telling these people, these small business operators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| that their guests and clients have to drive through Mr. Capiello's property to get to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2370)|
| 0:39:36| People aren't going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2376)|
| 0:39:38| When's the last time you tried to drive through a busy Kroger parking lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| People back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2382)|
| 0:39:43| People pull in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2383)|
| 0:39:44| It's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| It's not going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| There's another issue that no one's really talked about, and that's the safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2388)|
| 0:39:53| Currently, you cannot get out of the Homburg area through the west end by Naples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2393)|
| 0:40:02| It's treacherous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2402)|
| 0:40:03| It's on a curve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| Cars going eastbound speed through and accelerate through that curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| those cars obstruct the view of the cars going west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| You can't make a turn there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| At Homburg by the New Chick-fil-A, the east point, that's chaos also, and let me explain why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2417)|
| 0:40:25| There are 30,000 or 33,000 cars a day driving there, but they all change lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2425)|
| 0:40:31| and they're changing lanes at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2431)|
| 0:40:33| It's dangerous to make a right turn, and it's certainly dangerous to make a left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| The easiest way to get out of there is through Ben Atchley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2438)|
| 0:40:40| You've got a line of sight in both directions, and you've got a light at Mohegan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| and you've got a light at Westwood that gives you a momentary break to get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2445)|
| 0:40:51| If you take Atchley away, traffic is going to be forced up through Mohegan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| Mohegan is a narrow, one-lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| There are restaurants by the light that have a patio that's right on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2460)|
| 0:41:06| and you've got trucks that load and unload, blocking and obstructing your passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| Plus you've got pedestrians walking back and forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| You're going to diminish the amount of people that travel and come back and shop these businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| One minute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| One minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2483)|
| 0:41:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| You're going to crush them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2487)|
| 0:41:28| You're going to crush the property owners whose value of their buildings will be diminished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| That's a guarantee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| To this man's opinion, city council is here to help govern the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2495)|
| 0:41:42| but I don't think you own the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2502)|
| 0:41:44| You can't give away streets that belong to the people of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2504)|
| 0:41:50| that are a vital economic link to certain businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2510)|
| 0:41:54| It's been said around town that it's a short street, so it's insignificant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| What does that have to do with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| It's a vital street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| Try living without your renal artery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| It's a short artery, and it's vital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2526)|
| 0:42:12| I'm going to ask you tonight, whenever you make your decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2532)|
| 0:42:16| and you write the next chapter in the screenplay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| to use common sense and a sense of justice in making your decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2540)|
| 0:42:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| Thank you, Mr. Thaldesi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2550)|
| 0:42:32| Ken Holbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2552)|
| 0:42:50| My name is Ken Holbert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| and I guess my address is 1810 Aylor Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2572)|
| 0:42:57| or mailing address PO Box 1, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| I'm here on behalf of Frances Sexton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| and the underlying trust of which she is one of the creator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2584)|
| 0:43:10| and the other a beneficiary of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| Mr. Thaldesi hit on the issues that I think are very pertinent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2594)|
| 0:43:21| so I'm going to elaborate on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| I know there are lots of folks here who think that plans somehow materialize from a drawing board to reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2604)|
| 0:43:36| And I have a little bit of experience on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| I was general counsel for Knoxville's Community Development Corporation from 1971 to 1981.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2619)|
| 0:43:46| The last thing I did was create the World's Fair Corporation and buy all the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| I did a lot of planning back in those days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| One of the things that I thought was pretty absent here, Mr. Thaldesi really hit the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2634)|
| 0:44:02| This city and the mayor's office, the mayor, and by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2642)|
| 0:44:06| I want to apologize for the misspelling of your name on my letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| And I have given that letter to Ms. Mitchell for entry into the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2651)|
| 0:44:16| and so I want that noted that that letter is part of this record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| And I believe all the council members have been provided with a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2660)|
| 0:44:25| Now, if I haven't lost my train of thought, I'll get back to where I was relative to plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2665)|
| 0:44:34| I have yet, and I've searched, I do not see a plan that has been entertained by the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2674)|
| 0:44:44| whereby there is a compelling public purpose for the closing of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2684)|
| 0:44:52| It's absent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| You do not have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| Now, why is that significant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| It's significant because we have certain statutory laws and constitutional laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2699)|
| 0:45:07| I make note of the fact that we all stood and gave a pledge of allegiance to the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2707)|
| 0:45:14| And what is the one of the things we pledge to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| Justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2717)|
| 0:45:20| Let me assure you that the giving away of public property to a private owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2720)|
| 0:45:27| at the expense of other private owners is absence of justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2727)|
| 0:45:35| That is not justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| That's one of the things that the law protects against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| And that's serious business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2743)|
| 0:45:45| And I'm not sure this council has entertained that to the depth that you need to understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2745)|
| 0:45:52| I think it was Councilor Pavlis just earlier talked about a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| This is a slippery slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| It's important what you do with public assets whenever you are going to take a public asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2761)|
| 0:46:12| that has been providing for private property owners since 1927,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2772)|
| 0:46:23| and you take that away from those private properties, you've taken something from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2783)|
| 0:46:29| There are lots of amenities that are associated with that right-of-way that serve those folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2789)|
| 0:46:35| Now, what did those folks do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2795)|
| 0:46:40| They invested in their properties with that right-of-way in existence, knowingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2800)|
| 0:46:50| Now, what has Mr. Cappiello done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2810)|
| 0:46:58| He's bought a piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| And now he wants to acquire a public right-of-way so he can develop his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2821)|
| 0:47:10| That is not justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| And it's not doing him an injustice to make him, like every other property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2833)|
| 0:47:21| bear his own risk in investing in the property that he bought for the purpose of acquiring both sides of this right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2841)|
| 0:47:32| I submit to you that is a serious injustice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2852)|
| 0:47:37| The issue here is not whether or not this development will be an asset to the Bearden community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2857)|
| 0:47:45| The issue here is right and wrong and justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2865)|
| 0:47:50| That's the important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| That's the slippery slope you don't want to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| Your time is up, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2875)|
| 0:47:57| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2877)|
| 0:47:58| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2878)|
| 0:48:00| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2880)|
| 0:48:17| John King, PO Box 2425, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2897)|
| 0:48:21| I'm here on behalf of those individuals I identified at the time I appeared here for the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2901)|
| 0:48:28| I want to deal with the easement, first of all, in general fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| I'll talk about it some more as I go throughout my presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2911)|
| 0:48:35| But we did not reach any agreement on that easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| The easement itself presents enough problems for us not to be eager to consent to it, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2919)|
| 0:48:51| Illustrative of the problems are Grant Dorr is going to give an easement on the plan, he said, 25 feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2931)|
| 0:49:02| one he submitted before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| The easement document, he says it's 24 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2945)|
| 0:49:10| The city requires easements to be 26 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2950)|
| 0:49:15| And we know if it's 26 as opposed to 24, it starts affecting his parking on both sides of that easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2955)|
| 0:49:24| But more problematic is in that easement, he also says they can move it 50 feet to the west or the east, one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2964)|
| 0:49:33| I would observe either way he goes, whether east or west, with that easement, he's going to affect parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2973)|
| 0:49:41| And also, whether he goes east or west, he doesn't line up with the access point to Homburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2981)|
| 0:49:48| So I don't know what he's doing there, and neither do you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2988)|
| 0:49:53| Now, if you'll just continue to hold that for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2993)|
| 0:49:58| I've said before that he can do this development without closing Ben Atchley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=2998)|
| 0:50:03| I strongly believe that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| Apparently, others may not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3005)|
| 0:50:08| But this is the way he proposes to develop it and close Ben Atchley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3008)|
| 0:50:17| In doing that, he wants to create this easement through there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3017)|
| 0:50:22| and I've already described some of the problems with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| I want to turn this around on the other side now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3025)|
| 0:50:32| And I ask an engineering firm to give Mr. Cappiello all of the buildings that he wanted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3032)|
| 0:50:39| all the square footage that he wanted, and a required number of parking spaces on this development site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3039)|
| 0:50:46| without closing Ben Atchley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3046)|
| 0:50:49| There it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3049)|
| 0:50:51| It requires 110 parking spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| It's got 113.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| And Ben Atchley Street is still left open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3056)|
| 0:51:00| Now, separate and apart, I took his plan, his dimensions, et cetera, and put it on paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3060)|
| 0:51:12| The firm, Baxenheim, Norvell & Poe, and I've got Mr. Harbin sitting over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| He's the one who did this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| And he got the required parking without closing Ben Atchley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3079)|
| 0:51:22| Turn it back around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3082)|
| 0:51:24| But a bigger problem is not that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3084)|
| 0:51:27| It's the problems I identified when I first got this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3087)|
| 0:51:32| and then first was presented with the idea of this easement, and I started looking through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3092)|
| 0:51:37| City engineering tells me that there was a right-of-way dedication of property on the south side of Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3097)|
| 0:51:44| east of Ben Atchley Street, a dedication of additional right-of-way there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3104)|
| 0:51:50| And in order for him to use what he currently shows as 33 feet from the center line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3110)|
| 0:51:56| in order for him to use that for parking, he's got to go through a right-of-way closure process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3116)|
| 0:52:03| Now, if there's a dispute about whether that property was actually dedicated to the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| and, therefore, requires a closure process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| I would say to you that the city subdivision regs require on Kingston Pike a 44 feet from center line area of dedicated right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3131)|
| 0:52:26| I've got one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3146)|
| 0:52:27| I can't get this finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| If you do that, that line would go right through those parking spaces and take them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3149)|
| 0:52:36| There's nothing been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3156)|
| 0:52:37| There's been no right-of-way dedication or anything else done on the part that's over here on the other side of Ben Atchley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3157)|
| 0:52:44| And, once again, you have a 44-foot requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| He has to get a variance on either one or both of those except for this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| If it's been a right-of-way dedication, he's got to go through a closure process even more significantly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3172)|
| 0:53:01| There's 25 foot from center line for right-of-way on Homburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3181)|
| 0:53:06| He's showing 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3186)|
| 0:53:08| He's building in that right-of-way to be dedicated area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3188)|
| 0:53:13| Once again, in order to do what he's got proposed on this, he's got to have a variance on the Homburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3193)|
| 0:53:19| But that's not all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| Sir, your time is up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3200)|
| 0:53:21| That's not all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| I need to mention one other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| Well, hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| The council isn't offering to give you any more time at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| We have one more speaker, though, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| Then I would ask that somebody on city council ask city transportation how he gets around the radius requirement down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3216)|
| 0:53:45| that also, if it was enforced in the subdivision reg, it would take half of his building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| Mr. King, when, you know, after everybody presents, there will be time for questions and answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| and maybe some of this will come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3236)|
| 0:53:57| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| We're trying to just keep this moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| And now for the fourth speaker, Mr. Reckenbach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| Thank you, Madam Mayor, members of city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3246)|
| 0:54:09| My name is Tom Reckenbach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3249)|
| 0:54:10| I reside at 1201 Buena Road, Knoxville 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3250)|
| 0:54:15| For the past 49 years, I have either leased, owned, or operated a business on Homburg Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3255)|
| 0:54:22| Up until six years ago, I was actively involved in those businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3262)|
| 0:54:27| Many fond memories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3267)|
| 0:54:29| In the gallery, the art supply store, most recently the framing operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| Today, I still own two of those properties, and it's my social security and the opportunity to enjoy those golden years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3273)|
| 0:54:41| Tonight is not a golden moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| First of all, I think it's imperative for everyone to know that the business known as anthropology is coming to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3284)|
| 0:54:51| and will be located in the Bearden-Homburg area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| Tonight's meeting will not affect that fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| The majority of business and property owners of Bearden are truly excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3298)|
| 0:55:04| With regards to those businesses located on Homburg Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| we probably stand to gain more than most because of the proximity of their location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3307)|
| 0:55:14| Then you ask, why are we here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| One week ago, members of city council, the law director, council for city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| and our honorable mayor received a letter as well as an email from Kenneth Holbert, attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3322)|
| 0:55:28| regarding the request to close Ben Ashley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| If I may, I'd like to read one sentence from that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| Ben Ashley Street is a public right-of-way of immense value to all of the property owners located along Homburg Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3336)|
| 0:55:43| and that its closure would not serve the best interest of the general public of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3343)|
| 0:55:49| and that the closure would not serve a genuine public purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| The requested closure is clearly for the private gain of a single property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| to the detriment of multiple private owners whose businesses are served by Ben Ashley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3358)|
| 0:56:04| Starting at the west end of Homburg is the ornery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3364)|
| 0:56:07| There's the bank with the drive-thru tellers, the Homburg building, 15 business tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3367)|
| 0:56:13| including a medical facility that serves about several hundred people, patients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| Southern Market with 60 artisans and craftsmen, Dr. Davis' vet clinic, CMI Molding, Jerry's Artarama, Nostalgia, and on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3378)|
| 0:56:26| We located our businesses on Homburg because of easy access to Knoxville's main east-west corridor, Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3386)|
| 0:56:34| With the development at the corner of Mohican and Kingston Pike, things have not gotten easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3394)|
| 0:56:40| Many times throughout the day, the east lane of Mohican at the traffic signal is blocked by UPS, FedEx, beverage trucks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3400)|
| 0:56:47| and food vendors delivering to the two restaurants and the nine boutique shops all located on that corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3407)|
| 0:56:55| Has anyone considered the effect of Ben Ashley's closure on this blind intersection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3415)|
| 0:57:03| A posted 45-mile-an-hour speed limit doesn't help matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| Once Lines View is reopened, speeds, I'm sure, could become commonplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3428)|
| 0:57:14| Not really conducive to pedestrian shopping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3434)|
| 0:57:20| Speaking of sidewalks, we currently have sidewalks from Longs Drugstore to North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3440)|
| 0:57:27| There are the normal driveways, curb cuts, and street intersections, but we do have sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3447)|
| 0:57:34| I would ask Councilman Grieve, what new sidewalks are you proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3454)|
| 0:57:39| As an architect by profession, I respect your creative thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3459)|
| 0:57:44| but I have trouble visioning these new sidewalks with cobblestones, et cetera, going anywhere except to Mr. Capiello's parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3464)|
| 0:57:54| Mr. Wallace, a highly respected realtor, owner of the largest realty firms in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3474)|
| 0:58:00| How do you explain to your clients and our competitors your vote to give away city property valued at $235,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3480)|
| 0:58:09| Sir, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3489)|
| 0:58:10| Deeded to an individual for his personal gain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| Putting it on the tax rolls may be the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3493)|
| 0:58:15| At the current city tax rate, his taxes would be $2,217 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| That would take 106 years, 106 years, for the city to recoup the value of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3501)|
| 0:58:29| Help me understand where this serves genuine public interest or purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3509)|
| 0:58:37| Mr. Saunders, I asked you today at lunch, at our meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| to explain the benefit business owners on Homburg would have if you voted for this gift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| Your answer was, it's a matter of opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| Within the short five minutes I've been given,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| I have tried to explain the reasons, not opinions, for maintaining Ben Ashley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3537)|
| 0:58:58| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3538)|
| 0:59:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3541)|
| 0:59:02| Now, according to council rules, the side supporting the ordinance has up to two minutes to rebuttal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3542)|
| 0:59:07| Mr. Arthur Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3547)|
| 0:59:10| Mayor, members of council, Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| I'm here on behalf of Mr. Cappiello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| Let me remind you of just a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| Mr. Cappiello has been working on this project for over two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| This is not a new project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| He has been working on development of the Bearden community by bringing new retailers into it for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3568)|
| 0:59:38| His proposal was supported by the MPC staff, was reviewed by city engineering, KUB,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3578)|
| 0:59:46| and the other agencies of the city of Knoxville, which had no objection to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3586)|
| 0:59:51| He is actively supported by the Bearden council, as exemplified by Mrs. Faulkner's eloquent statement before you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3591)|
| 1:00:01| The Bearden district, which is the Bearden business community, supports this overwhelmingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3601)|
| 1:00:10| Government was formed many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3610)|
| 1:00:13| One minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3613)|
| 1:00:16| Government was formed for many purposes, for security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3616)|
| 1:00:19| But one thing or two things that government was formed to do was to promote the common welfare and the common good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3619)|
| 1:00:28| And that's what we're asking for you to do tonight, to support this, to promote the common welfare and the common good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3628)|
| 1:00:35| not only of the Bearden district and the Bearden area, but for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3635)|
| 1:00:42| We ask you to support this closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3647)|
| 1:00:48| That concludes our speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3648)|
| 1:00:49| So, council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3649)|
| 1:00:53| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3653)|
| 1:00:55| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3655)|
| 1:00:56| I just wanted to state on the record, again, I work with Mr. King, so I'll be abstaining.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3656)|
| 1:01:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3661)|
| 1:01:02| Mr. Dallavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3662)|
| 1:01:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3663)|
| 1:01:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3664)|
| 1:01:05| I think all of us have received hundreds of e-mails and phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3665)|
| 1:01:10| and have been to now two meetings about this subject, so there's not a ton that's new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| It strikes me that as good as this proposal sounds, parts of it aren't in concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3677)|
| 1:01:25| And more importantly, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3685)|
| 1:01:28| I don't see how we can take this public road and close it to benefit one development project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3688)|
| 1:01:38| and potentially, and I say potentially because no one knows the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| damage other businesses that have been there for a substantial period of time that have relied on access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3702)|
| 1:01:49| It's not hard to foresee that if this development is truly successful, we'll have more cars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3709)|
| 1:01:57| more need for action on safer roadways, and before long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| we will be taking the corner of that triangle next to Naples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3722)|
| 1:02:07| and trying to make a nice turn radius there and put a traffic light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| and develop a road and spend a million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3732)|
| 1:02:15| It's not hard to see that coming down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| Now the question is how good is this opportunity that we have before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3738)|
| 1:02:25| Mr. Cappiello paints a picture of better retail on the Kingston Pike side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3745)|
| 1:02:31| Obviously, he's looking towards the heavy traffic on Kingston Pike and not towards what happens on Homburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3751)|
| 1:02:38| And I'm concerned that while that may well be a great thing for him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3758)|
| 1:02:43| and maybe even for the city in terms of more shopping, Homburg will be further isolated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3763)|
| 1:02:49| I don't know about you, but I've been to sections of that Homburg business district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3769)|
| 1:02:53| especially down on the eastern end where the shopping center had great restaurants at a time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| and like a nature's pantry kind of health food store and lots of activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3779)|
| 1:03:04| And most of them have dried up and are empty buildings now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3784)|
| 1:03:08| And I think it's one of those out-of-sight, out-of-mind situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3788)|
| 1:03:13| We have people here that have come to us and said, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| we're not legally having frontage on Ben Ashley Road, but we're served by it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3796)|
| 1:03:23| We get visibility from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3803)|
| 1:03:25| We rely on it to get some customers, some supply, some view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3805)|
| 1:03:31| I guess I'm back to where I was two weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3811)|
| 1:03:34| I was hoping maybe there was going to be a solution that made everyone reasonably happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3814)|
| 1:03:39| or as lawyers sometimes say, reasonably unhappy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| You each give up something you wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3822)|
| 1:03:44| But in return, you get a workable plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| But I still see the same opposition out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3827)|
| 1:03:50| So, again, I don't know how we can pick winners and losers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3830)|
| 1:03:54| I don't know how we really think that this one strip of sidewalk is going to transform Beard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| And I know that Ms. Faulkner has worked for years to make a walkable business district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3839)|
| 1:04:04| and neighborhood district, and it's commendable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| But I don't know that this one parcel is going to do that much to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3848)|
| 1:04:13| And we may be sacrificing three or four businesses that have spent, you'd have to say, millions of dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| That vet clinic looks like a gorgeous, expensive building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| There's the office building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| There's the southern market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3864)|
| 1:04:25| There's the old retin box, now the new art supply place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3865)|
| 1:04:31| How can we sacrifice those people on the altar of a promise that may not come true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3871)|
| 1:04:36| I mean, what if anthropology comes in there, because they say they're coming either way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3876)|
| 1:04:40| and then they decide, well, I'd rather be in Turkey Creek, and they move out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| What if we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3884)|
| 1:04:45| We have no Ben Ashley Drive, and we have kind of a reshuffling of that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3885)|
| 1:04:51| I just think Homburg is enough out of the action that if you hurt its access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| you hurt the traffic that will come there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3896)|
| 1:04:58| So maybe this thing will benefit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3898)|
| 1:05:01| Maybe it will be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| But I don't see how we make that decision here with so little in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3902)|
| 1:05:08| We have an easement, but we don't have any bond to say that the improvements will be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3908)|
| 1:05:13| We don't have anything to follow up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3913)|
| 1:05:15| I saw the draft that the city or they gave out as a supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3915)|
| 1:05:19| The city wrote, the city of Knoxville will not be required or compelled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3919)|
| 1:05:22| to enforce the covenants of this easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3922)|
| 1:05:25| So it's going to be purely a private deal once we give up the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| And I just don't know how we can go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3929)|
| 1:05:32| This is a road that still serves others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| It's not a dead end into someone's parcel like it was when we heard Mr. Seymour tell us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3935)|
| 1:05:43| about how we were going to close the road that went into Gerdau Steel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3943)|
| 1:05:47| It dead ended in their plant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3947)|
| 1:05:49| This one goes into another road and serves that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| So I've said too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3953)|
| 1:05:54| But I just think that we haven't answered the objections that were out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| And I urge you to reject the closure of the road for those reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| Maybe we can shrink its size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3963)|
| 1:06:05| Maybe we can do something to be accommodating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3965)|
| 1:06:07| But it ought to be a public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3967)|
| 1:06:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3969)|
| 1:06:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3970)|
| 1:06:11| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3971)|
| 1:06:12| Thank you, Mayor Harrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3972)|
| 1:06:14| So I want to dovetail off of Councilman Della Vopi's statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| I, too, want to, first off, congratulate Mr. Cappiello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| I love what you're doing, with one exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| And we've discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| But I want to congratulate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| I think you've done Knoxville good by bringing another well-known retailer to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3991)|
| 1:06:38| And I commend you and thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=3998)|
| 1:06:41| But I think Nick sums it up well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| I mean, I come, my background is a small family business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| Mr. Cappiello is not Wal-Mart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4006)|
| 1:06:48| He's not Sears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4008)|
| 1:06:49| I don't think he's heavy-handed in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4009)|
| 1:06:51| He's just trying to do the best for his development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| And I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4013)|
| 1:06:56| But the people behind Ben Ashley on Homburg, again, I'll say, they bought, leased,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4016)|
| 1:07:02| and constructed based on a current market that they thought would remain like that for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4022)|
| 1:07:10| And I realize things change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4030)|
| 1:07:12| But I don't think it's government's business to go in and change it for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4032)|
| 1:07:17| I think, you know, something else could happen to make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| But for us to go in and do that, I just can't take that chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4041)|
| 1:07:25| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| There's nobody in this room that knows it's going to hurt or is it going to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4047)|
| 1:07:32| But I'm not willing to take the chance of hurting their investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| small business people who have founded this country's financial backbone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4057)|
| 1:07:43| and risk what they've invested when I still think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| I still think that this deal could be done with parking, as Mr. King has shown us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4068)|
| 1:07:56| And I just can't go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4076)|
| 1:07:58| I just can't really realize that this is something that will be a deal killer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4078)|
| 1:08:06| I mean, they've already said they're coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4086)|
| 1:08:08| And I just don't think that it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4088)|
| 1:08:10| And I'm not willing to take that risk for the small business owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4090)|
| 1:08:14| and those that have spent their money, personal money, no government help, to make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4094)|
| 1:08:23| So I won't be supporting it either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4107)|
| 1:08:28| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4108)|
| 1:08:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| I heard Councilman De La Vopa and Vice Mayor Pavlis talk about closing the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4110)|
| 1:08:35| and that this is a very difficult decision, and there's no doubt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| But earlier this week, I guess it was a couple of days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| we got a report from MPC on their actions for the first quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4124)|
| 1:08:48| And during the first quarter of 2013, there were six alley and street closures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4128)|
| 1:08:54| Four of those were approved by this council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4134)|
| 1:08:57| One of them is under consideration, and that's the Ben Actually Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| And the sixth one was withdrawn or postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4142)|
| 1:09:07| So this council has not seemed to hesitate to close a street, close an alley in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4147)|
| 1:09:15| and I'm not quite sure why we suddenly have a conscience about how terrible this is to take people's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4155)|
| 1:09:25| I'm just not quite seeing all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| I will be supporting the closure of Ben Actually Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4168)|
| 1:09:31| I think that it's very painful to experience changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4171)|
| 1:09:35| I think that the southern market will be surprised,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| and I would really hope that in a year and a half from now you come back and tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4179)|
| 1:09:44| boy, you guys really screwed up or you really did the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| But be as passionate a year and a half from now with your success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4188)|
| 1:09:52| and if you're not successful, come back and beat on us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4192)|
| 1:09:55| But I really do think that this is the right thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| And again, we don't seem to have a problem closing streets in some neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| Councilman Grave?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4205)|
| 1:10:06| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4206)|
| 1:10:07| I think I pretty well expressed myself last time in terms of the support that I have for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| I think that many times it's been kind of interesting, I think, in talking with a number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| We've gotten a lot of e-mails, a lot of telephone calls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| and people like to support progress, but they don't like change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| And I think that's what we really have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4224)|
| 1:10:27| I'm convinced, and Tom, yes, as an architect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4227)|
| 1:10:30| what I'm looking at is the possibility of more sidewalks in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4230)|
| 1:10:36| I think that I'm going to make a motion that we approve this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4236)|
| 1:10:40| and then I'm going to ask for an amendment to the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| because I want to go on record in terms of what Tony has agreed to so that we do have it on record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4242)|
| 1:10:48| Now, whether that's enforceable or not, the council can tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4248)|
| 1:10:51| but I think it's imperative that we go on record with what he said that he's going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4251)|
| 1:10:57| I think that one of the things that the mayor has talked about is a sustainable city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4257)|
| 1:11:04| one that's environmentally friendly, and I think we have a great opportunity to start that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| or I should say, excuse me, Terry, to continue that in the Bearden area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4268)|
| 1:11:14| We talk about sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| I know some of us use those sidewalks in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4276)|
| 1:11:19| I think we have a possibility of using not only the Homburg area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4279)|
| 1:11:23| but all the way up to Chick-fil-A and all those back areas to where we can add more sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4283)|
| 1:11:28| and we can make it more green than what it already is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4288)|
| 1:11:32| And so without belaboring the point, I am going to make a recommendation to approve 9F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4292)|
| 1:11:38| and then I'd like to make an amendment to that, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4301)|
| 1:11:42| When the time comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4302)|
| 1:11:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| Go ahead, Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4307)|
| 1:11:50| Well, you know, not to continue to belabor it, but we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4310)|
| 1:11:54| So, I mean, I still support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4314)|
| 1:11:56| Tom, I appreciate your recognition of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4316)|
| 1:11:59| I certainly have tried to apply my real estate knowledge to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4319)|
| 1:12:03| and I do believe that it will make a better development for along Kingston Pike and along Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4323)|
| 1:12:09| without the detriment of the businesses or the property values on Homburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4329)|
| 1:12:13| That's certainly my opinion, and I have looked at it, looked at it a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4333)|
| 1:12:17| live in Bearden and myself, and I'm very familiar with this road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| and I don't think in any way it's going to hurt the values of the properties on Homburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4341)|
| 1:12:27| I support it, and I'm pledging, you know, my support of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4347)|
| 1:12:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4357)|
| 1:12:42| I just wanted to mention one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| Hold on just a second, Ms. Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4364)|
| 1:12:46| I'll go ahead and recognize if it's possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4369)|
| 1:12:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4370)|
| 1:12:51| Councilman Graves is recognizing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4371)|
| 1:12:52| I wanted to quickly mention that there are three other connections from Kingston Pike into Homburg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4372)|
| 1:12:58| in addition to the Ben Ashley, which has not been mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4382)|
| 1:13:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4383)|
| 1:13:05| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4385)|
| 1:13:06| Yeah, I would like to make a motion to approve 9F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4390)|
| 1:13:11| Okay, we already have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| Okay, that's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4393)|
| 1:13:14| We have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| And I'd like to make a motion to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4395)|
| 1:13:18| I'd like to make an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4398)|
| 1:13:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4399)|
| 1:13:20| And I'll ask Council to make sure I do this correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4400)|
| 1:13:26| I'd like to add to it that, number one, that we do have an easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4406)|
| 1:13:33| a road easement from Kingston Pike to Homburg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| that we have the repair of sidewalks on Kingston Pike as well as a new sidewalk along Homburg,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4417)|
| 1:13:43| along his property, that he creates a crosswalk from the parking area across the street on Homburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4423)|
| 1:13:54| Three would be that there would be a landscape entry from Kingston Pike onto the access road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4434)|
| 1:14:01| that he does add extensive landscaping and the historical markers that he's talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4441)|
| 1:14:07| and that also that the fifth item, the removal of the billboard when the lease expires in seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4447)|
| 1:14:16| We have discussed these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4456)|
| 1:14:18| And I'll second that amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4458)|
| 1:14:21| Okay, our lawyers are conferring here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4461)|
| 1:14:28| Mr. Ross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| Mr. Grieve asked me to, he was wanting to make some conditions on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4470)|
| 1:14:34| Mr. Swanson and I have earlier discussed today that what's before Council is concerning the alley closure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4474)|
| 1:14:42| The city is not a party to nor will the city be enforcing any of Mr. Capiello's promises to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4482)|
| 1:14:54| or the Homburg area or the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4494)|
| 1:14:58| So it's not city council's business to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4498)|
| 1:15:04| And I won't speak for, certainly speak for the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| and allow Mr. Swanson to say his piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4512)|
| 1:15:13| Let me make sure I've got your, turned off my microphone, probably a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4513)|
| 1:15:19| I want to make sure I've got the easement I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4519)|
| 1:15:23| That was the number one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| Then the second thing you said was what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4530)|
| 1:15:31| Repairing sidewalks on Kingston Pike and adding a sidewalk along Homburg on his property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4531)|
| 1:15:37| And I realize that we as a city can't enforce this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4537)|
| 1:15:40| but I want to make sure that we go on record that it's been documented that he has agreed to do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4540)|
| 1:15:47| So do we put this with this amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4547)|
| 1:15:49| Well, I really don't think we can put that as a part of amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4549)|
| 1:15:53| With regard to the easement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| I think that you can amend this to make the road closure subject to an easement between private parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4555)|
| 1:16:05| which the city will play strictly between private parties and the city will play no role in enforcing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4565)|
| 1:16:12| But when you start talking about obligations about sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4572)|
| 1:16:16| the city is the only party who could enforce obligations about sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| And we will enforce our codes with regard to sidewalks as they exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| But we can't, by this method,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| add additional obligations through the process of closing a street for additional obligations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4589)|
| 1:16:37| because only the city would be enforcing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| So I don't --I'm comfortable with you amending it to include the obligation that this easement between private parties be included,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4600)|
| 1:16:53| but the obligation about sidewalks, which only the city could enforce,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| I do not believe is a proper amendment to this motion because this is a motion to close a public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4617)|
| 1:17:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4625)|
| 1:17:07| As far as what you and I talked about then, it would not be a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4627)|
| 1:17:13| Well, like Mr. Swanson said, the easement would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4633)|
| 1:17:16| it's whatever Mr. Swanson believes that the city council does not administer contracts and ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4636)|
| 1:17:26| Council reviews and approves and votes or turns down things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4646)|
| 1:17:32| If the administration's that's there in the separation of powers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4652)|
| 1:17:36| the administration would be the one that would administer and monitor and turn over the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4656)|
| 1:17:44| assuming the vote is there to close the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4664)|
| 1:17:48| So then just cancel the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4668)|
| 1:17:51| There's no way to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4671)|
| 1:17:52| Except for the easement portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| If you want to leave the easement portion in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4673)|
| 1:17:56| it's subject to the recording of what I have been furnished with a copy of a declaration of permanent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4676)|
| 1:18:06| non-exclusive easement for access between certain private parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4686)|
| 1:18:11| If you want to include that as an amendment to the motion, I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4691)|
| 1:18:17| But all of those other things that would be essentially are amendments to our ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4697)|
| 1:18:22| and would require the city to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4702)|
| 1:18:25| I just don't believe they're proper motions, proper amendments to a motion to close a public right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4705)|
| 1:18:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| Then I'll just have the amendment deals with subject to the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| Was there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4721)|
| 1:18:42| I think I have the same concern that Charles has been trying to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4722)|
| 1:18:45| And let me see if I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4725)|
| 1:18:48| We can make that a condition of transferring property that easement is executed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4728)|
| 1:18:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| It's a condition of closing the public right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| You can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4747)|
| 1:19:08| And add those other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4748)|
| 1:19:09| I'm comfortable with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| This that Mr. Seymour has given us indicates interested parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4754)|
| 1:19:19| I don't know who the interested parties may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4759)|
| 1:19:22| I don't know that it's going to be all of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| They're identified in the whereas clause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| Sexton Davis AWR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| Am I looking at the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4772)|
| 1:19:33| Declaration of permanent non-exclusive easement for access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| Try looking at the first page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4777)|
| 1:19:39| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4779)|
| 1:19:40| I'm on the first page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4780)|
| 1:19:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4781)|
| 1:19:42| And in the whereas clauses, that information there identifies the Sexton parcel, the Davis parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4782)|
| 1:19:47| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4787)|
| 1:19:48| AWR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| So I thought I had heard either Mr. Capiello or Mr. Seymour, I'm not sure who,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4790)|
| 1:19:56| say that nobody had accepted to be an interested party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4796)|
| 1:20:03| That's my concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4803)|
| 1:20:04| Well, I don't think he has to have anybody accept it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| I think he's just going to, as the grantor, execute this easement to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4809)|
| 1:20:15| and the only people who could then enforce it would be the grantees of the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4815)|
| 1:20:19| They may choose not to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4819)|
| 1:20:22| But they would have the easement because they would be granted that easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4822)|
| 1:20:26| It seems to me it would be in their best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4828)|
| 1:20:29| They would have to decide whether it would be in their best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4829)|
| 1:20:30| That's what I'm concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4830)|
| 1:20:31| I want to make sure that what we agree to is in fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4831)|
| 1:20:36| These grantees would have the right to enforce the easement whether they chose to do so or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4836)|
| 1:20:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4842)|
| 1:20:43| Vice Mayor Pavlis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4843)|
| 1:20:45| King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| Mr. King, you're being called upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4847)|
| 1:20:54| Don't bring that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4854)|
| 1:21:07| I understood you earlier to say that your clients were not interested in being part of an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4867)|
| 1:21:14| What I said was we were opposed to the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| We wanted the street to remain open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4878)|
| 1:21:22| If somebody has proposed an easement, he can execute that easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| and he can record that easement without, if you will, our agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4886)|
| 1:21:31| It runs to our benefit ultimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| But we did not, if you will, agree that by execution of that easement that we had an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4895)|
| 1:21:44| that our opposition was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4904)|
| 1:21:47| That's our position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| I just feel compelled and it's sort of along those lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4910)|
| 1:22:00| Somebody probably doesn't comprehend or understand why we're unwilling to take this easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4920)|
| 1:22:08| and are still opposed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| If, in fact, you're going to vote to close this street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| then the amendment proposed over here that includes that is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| I would simply observe that right now, with all of the required variances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4941)|
| 1:22:33| none of them having been approved, or the right-of-way closure that's required not having been approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4953)|
| 1:22:43| that the turning radius at the intersection western end of this project at Homburg and Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4963)|
| 1:22:52| the variance not being approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| With the variance on Homburg that's required not being approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4975)|
| 1:22:59| With the required approval of the Department of Transportation for the access points to Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4979)|
| 1:23:06| not having been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4986)|
| 1:23:08| All I can say to you is today you don't know what's going to be built, where it's going to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4988)|
| 1:23:16| and where the parking is ultimately going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=4996)|
| 1:23:20| The one thing we do know is if you approve this, don't do it on the basis of this plan submitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| because the one thing we do know is if this road is closed, this project will not be built like that plan shows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5007)|
| 1:23:39| Okay, counsel, so now we have an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5019)|
| 1:23:41| We have a motion and a second on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5021)|
| 1:23:44| Does everyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5024)|
| 1:23:46| Mr. King, let me just say, so you're saying that this amendment would be to the benefit of your client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5026)|
| 1:23:53| should they decide to be part of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| Well, we don't get to decide whether we're part of it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| It's not even set up for agreement by my clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5038)|
| 1:24:03| It is proposed as an easement by the grantor to a group of people that include my clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5043)|
| 1:24:13| It's a nice way of sort of, you know, just another box they put you in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5053)|
| 1:24:17| Well, we're going to take the road, but we're going to give you an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| Well, we don't want the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| But, as I say, if ultimately it's the decision of this body that you're going to close the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5061)|
| 1:24:27| then obviously anybody would prefer that the easement be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5067)|
| 1:24:33| Right now, you're about to vote to require that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| And, you know, if it's going to get closed, I would say at least do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5077)|
| 1:24:43| But what I'm suggesting to you is when you've got an easement that says it's 24 feet wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5083)|
| 1:24:49| and we move it 50 feet in one direction or the other, you don't know where that ultimately is going to be either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5089)|
| 1:24:55| We're not willing to agree that, yes, everything's okay because they gave us this easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5095)|
| 1:25:01| It produces its own set of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| But if it's the will of this body that you're going to close this street when you have all of these issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5103)|
| 1:25:09| that are still out there undecided, what needs to happen is this plan needs to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5109)|
| 1:25:15| and it needs to sit down with city engineering and not talk about review my plan to close the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5115)|
| 1:25:21| review my plan for development and get all of these issues straightened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5121)|
| 1:25:26| I got this last Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| I got to work on it Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5128)|
| 1:25:30| Friday I was out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5130)|
| 1:25:31| Monday we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| Everybody's closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| So I get to work on it today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| Those are the issues that I found, and they're pretty significant about this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5134)|
| 1:25:42| You can't tell for sure where the parking's going to go when this plan gets routed through all the proper bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5142)|
| 1:25:51| I'm just sorry city engineering isn't here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5151)|

| 1:30:00| When this came to Council last time we met, there were some concerns because there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5400)|
| 1:30:07| an awareness in the Bearden community that had not previously been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5407)|
| 1:30:11| On Thursday of last week, Chris Caldwell, the County Finance Director, Mayor Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5411)|
| 1:30:20| and a financial wizard from the school board, and I met with the principal at Bearden Middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5420)|
| 1:30:26| and the PTA representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5426)|
| 1:30:28| And when we went over this process and that one of the parcels we're voting on tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5428)|
| 1:30:33| would be office and there are interested parties in that parcel, they were satisfied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5433)|
| 1:30:39| But the big concern was the corner lot we're not considering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| But they're okay with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| And I just wanted to get that out so that the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| This is the house parcel, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5446)|
| 1:30:47| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5447)|
| 1:30:48| This is the house parcel tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5448)|
| 1:30:49| And they're happy with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5449)|
| 1:30:50| And they're okay with the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| But we're not voting on the other one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5454)|

| 1:30:57| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| With all due respect, and I'm going to support this, Councilman Palmer, but I just have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5458)|
| 1:31:01| problem with property that the school or the county owns that's adjacent to property that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| they're selling it and getting rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| So I just want to voice that opinion that I understand that when we change the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5468)|
| 1:31:13| that the idea is that the county is going to sell the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5476)|
| 1:31:17| That's correct because the county owns the corner parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5479)|
| 1:31:20| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5480)|
| 1:31:21| And on that corner parcel, they will also...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5481)|

| 1:33:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5637)|
| 1:33:58| We are reconvening the next meeting of City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5638)|
| 1:34:02| We are now on 11A resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5642)|
| 1:34:05| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute an agreement with the University| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5645)|
| 1:34:09| of Tennessee delaying the return of ten city-owned bus shelters located on the university's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5649)|
| 1:34:14| Knoxville campus until such time as these shelters are replaced by the university with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| new shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5658)|
| 1:34:19| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5659)|
| 1:34:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5660)|
| 1:34:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5661)|
| 1:34:22| We have a couple people that have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5662)|
| 1:34:24| First is Reverend Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5664)|
| 1:34:27| Nice to have you here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| You know I have to buy rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5669)|
| 1:34:30| I've got to set the timer on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| So please state your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| I promise you that I won't take a text.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5675)|
| 1:34:36| My name is Harold Middlebrook, 2334 Dandridge Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37915.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5676)|
| 1:34:45| Mayor Rojero, members of council, I seldom come before council to express my views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5685)|
| 1:34:52| I usually just express my views to council members individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5692)|
| 1:34:57| I was out of town when the last council meeting was held concerning this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5697)|
| 1:35:02| But I wanted to express my views representing many who could not speak for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5702)|
| 1:35:09| The university has entered into a contract with a company other than Catrans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5709)|
| 1:35:16| And we the citizens are expected to fund the amenities for this new company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5716)|
| 1:35:25| I hear people saying that the university will turn these shelters over to the city when they build the new shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5725)|
| 1:35:36| I suggest to you that UT either buy the shelters from the city, Catrans, within a period not to exceed 60 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5736)|
| 1:35:49| or employees of the city who must work daily anyway be instructed to remove those shelters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5749)|
| 1:35:57| that they might be used by the taxpayers, the riders of the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5757)|
| 1:36:03| and that those shelters be placed within the city of Knoxville where our people throughout this city ride the buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5763)|
| 1:36:13| and would benefit from those shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5773)|
| 1:36:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5776)|
| 1:36:17| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5778)|
| 1:36:19| And now Mr. Rick Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5779)|
| 1:36:24| And hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5784)|
| 1:36:27| Name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| Rick Roach, 2404 Victoria Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| And basically what he just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5793)|
| 1:36:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5797)|
| 1:36:38| Just an emphasis as a rider, again, you know, I've been in those situations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5798)|
| 1:36:44| especially in weather in this time of year, high heat, heavy rain, thunderstorms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| and in the areas that I board, which pretty much is all over the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5809)|
| 1:36:54| but on the east side the routes that I utilize along Magnolia, along MLK, the Dandridge Avenue 32 route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5814)|
| 1:37:04| there are those locations where a lot of people utilize, and those shelters are needed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5824)|
| 1:37:11| If I had heard from the previous council meeting that there was a commitment to put new shelters in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5831)|
| 1:37:20| or whatever, I still would back the situation of not handing over properties to the university, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5840)|
| 1:37:31| and just taking that property back and still relocating them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5851)|
| 1:37:35| There's that great a need right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| Basically, you know, the whole process of installing, installation, and things of this nature, you know, you account for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5858)|
| 1:37:46| I'm not a great business person or anything like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5866)|
| 1:37:49| but I would think that that's something that you would have already within your budget, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5869)|
| 1:37:55| outlook in terms of labor expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5875)|
| 1:37:58| And, you know, we already know hourly wage people are there to do what they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5878)|
| 1:38:05| and one of those things is maintenance of the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5885)|
| 1:38:09| And these shelters are, at this point in time, CAT facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5889)|
| 1:38:14| And just to give them over to the university, no, that to me just doesn't work when we have such a great need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5894)|
| 1:38:22| especially in the area that I live and work and play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5902)|
| 1:38:26| So, again, I would not be for this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| It stands especially without a time frame in which to get this done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5910)|
| 1:38:38| You know, let's get this done and get the ridership of CAT served properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5918)|
| 1:38:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5925)|
| 1:38:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5926)|
| 1:38:47| Council, I would like to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5927)|
| 1:38:52| And first I have to say that good and reasonable people and friends can often disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5932)|
| 1:38:58| and I have friends out in the audience who have just spoken and some others who spoke last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5938)|
| 1:39:02| And I and my staff, I want to say we support the recommendation from KTA, and I'll tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5942)|
| 1:39:11| This is not for the benefit of the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5951)|
| 1:39:14| This is for the benefit of riders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5954)|
| 1:39:17| Many people take CAT from their apartment or from work, and they take it over to campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5957)|
| 1:39:26| We will continue to provide services, the lift service, to people with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5966)|
| 1:39:31| So we would be removing shelters, you know, that people with disabilities on campus are now using before the university is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5971)|
| 1:39:41| you know, in position to put their own up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5981)|
| 1:39:46| So these shelters will continue to be used by taxpayers, by university faculty, by staff, by residents, by tourists, by guests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5986)|
| 1:39:54| you know, to the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5994)|
| 1:39:55| So, again, it's not to the benefit of the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| It is to the benefit of the people who ride mass transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| And I believe that the compromise, we heard the folks from last time who were here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6001)|
| 1:40:06| this is a compromise resolution that made it clear that when the university puts in their own shelters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6006)|
| 1:40:15| because they say they have a plan to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| then at that time the city can take a look and see whether we want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6017)|
| 1:40:22| And if we do want them, then we will remove them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6022)|
| 1:40:26| And if we don't, then the university will remove them at their expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6026)|
| 1:40:31| Either way, the sidewalk damage that might occur will be, those damages will be repaired by the university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6031)|
| 1:40:38| So I believe I've described that right, have I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6038)|
| 1:40:41| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| So I do, despite the fact good friends of mine are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| I do believe that this is the right thing for us to do at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6045)|
| 1:40:49| and I would encourage you to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6052)|
| 1:40:53| Thank you, Mayor, and I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6053)|
| 1:40:55| One other point that I think needs to be made, you appoint these board members for the Knoxville Transit Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6055)|
| 1:41:03| We approve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6063)|
| 1:41:05| And I think we expect them to act in a responsible manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6065)|
| 1:41:09| and I know they've had the discussions that perhaps were held here last time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| and I want to support those people who volunteer to be appointed to that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6074)|
| 1:41:19| So I do support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| Councilman Daldopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6082)|
| 1:41:23| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6083)|
| 1:41:24| Well, I guess we agree to disagree somewhat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| In my mind, without a deadline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6087)|
| 1:41:30| it seems to me that UT gets the option of using these until they wear them out or break them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6090)|
| 1:41:36| and then we get stuck with leftover sort of worthless junk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6096)|
| 1:41:40| I mean, I would prefer that we sell them outright to the new bus company, that we lease them to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6100)|
| 1:41:46| or that we pull them out, maybe with the consideration that we're helping other residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6106)|
| 1:41:54| and taxpayers ride the bus with shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6114)|
| 1:41:58| We leave them there, as you suggest, but why not 90 days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| Why not a deadline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| Because as I look at these photographs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6124)|
| 1:42:06| it looks like if you sent a crew out with a flatbed truck in a ratchet set,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6126)|
| 1:42:11| they could take the bolts, the four bolts off each of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6131)|
| 1:42:14| or the nuts off each of those four legs, lift it carefully, lay it on a flatbed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6134)|
| 1:42:19| put it on foam if you want to protect the glass, and haul them away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| So while they're still in good condition, we should salvage them and put them to work elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6143)|
| 1:42:30| If we want UT to use them for a while, they should have a deadline to make up their mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6150)|
| 1:42:34| whether they want them or whether they want to buy them or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| I don't know why 90 days wouldn't be a fair amount of time for them to evaluate where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6157)|
| 1:42:42| So that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6162)|
| 1:42:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6163)|
| 1:42:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6164)|
| 1:42:45| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6165)|
| 1:42:46| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6166)|
| 1:42:47| As the council representative to CAT, I want to say, as I stated before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6167)|
| 1:42:53| I would like to see some new shelters placed in the community throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6173)|
| 1:42:59| And it was stated at the last council meeting by Ms. McGinnis that there was, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6179)|
| 1:43:05| a figure of $50,000 available in the budget to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6185)|
| 1:43:10| And I, as well, have great respect and admiration for those who have spoken here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6190)|
| 1:43:17| But I just think we need to get some new shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6197)|
| 1:43:21| If you take these shelters down, people there on the campus, they also have needed those shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6201)|
| 1:43:28| And it's just not cost prohibitive to do that, in my humble opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| So I want to see some new shelters placed throughout the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6212)|
| 1:43:37| And that's the position of the CAT board, of which I am a member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6217)|
| 1:43:42| So thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6222)|
| 1:43:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6224)|
| 1:43:45| And, again, this is for the people using the service, not for the institution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6225)|
| 1:43:52| Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6232)|
| 1:43:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6234)|
| 1:43:55| Again, I expressed myself on this last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| I was sort of surprised that it took the postponement to learn that UT was planning on replacing them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6238)|
| 1:44:04| Do we have a timeline on when that is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6244)|
| 1:44:08| I see you're shaking your head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6248)|
| 1:44:10| So, no, we don't know if it's one year, five, or they have, like, a 50-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6250)|
| 1:44:19| Anyway, I mean, I certainly agree with the mayor and everyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6259)|
| 1:44:25| I'll probably support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6265)|
| 1:44:26| But, you know, I think it's led to a good discussion that there's a lot of bus stops out there without shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6266)|
| 1:44:38| And we know to increase ridership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| and make public transportation more and more a mainstream form of transportation in the city that we're going to need shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6280)|
| 1:44:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6288)|
| 1:44:49| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6289)|
| 1:44:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6290)|
| 1:44:51| I think that this has clarified some of the things for me from the standpoint that we do need to understand that the riders are not just the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6291)|
| 1:44:59| I think a lot of times when we see that, we think, uh-oh, big old University of Tennessee is taking over and we're just giving stuff away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6299)|
| 1:45:06| But I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| I think we do have to consider that there's riders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| The thing that I get out of all of this is we need bus shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6309)|
| 1:45:14| And we need them in different parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6314)|
| 1:45:16| And it's obvious from the people that have spoken that that's one thing that we need to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6316)|
| 1:45:21| Maybe a bond issue, George.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6321)|
| 1:45:25| But what I'm saying is, I mean, not to make light of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6325)|
| 1:45:30| but I think that what has really come out is the fact that there are areas in the town that need bus shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| And I think we all need to realize that the University area, not just University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6334)|
| 1:45:39| but that area, Cumberland Avenue and that area, has a lot of riders and that we're responsible for those people also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6339)|
| 1:45:45| So I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6345)|
| 1:45:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6347)|
| 1:45:48| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6348)|
| 1:45:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6349)|
| 1:45:50| Last time we asked that some kind of compromise or discussion occur, that has occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6350)|
| 1:45:56| Obviously, everybody would like to know that on June the 14th, those bus shelters are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6356)|
| 1:46:02| But we don't know that, and we won't know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6362)|
| 1:46:04| We have a new bus service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| We don't, but the university has a new bus service coming in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6366)|
| 1:46:09| And with their shiny new buses, they'll probably want shiny new shelters fairly soon, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6369)|
| 1:46:14| So I'm going to support this because the discussion has been very healthy that we do have some bus issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6374)|
| 1:46:21| not only in shelters but service areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6381)|
| 1:46:24| I would hope that these shelters are moved sooner than later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6389)|
| 1:46:30| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6394)|
| 1:46:35| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6395)|
| 1:46:36| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6396)|
| 1:46:37| That is one no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6397)|
| 1:46:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6400)|
| 1:46:42| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6402)|
| 1:46:43| Thank you all for being here as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| 11B is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into an agreement with Knoxville-Knox County Community Action Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6405)|

| 1:47:01| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6421)|
| 1:47:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6422)|
| 1:47:03| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6425)|

| 1:47:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6427)|
| 1:47:08| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6428)|
| 1:47:09| 11C is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute and deliver an agreement with Wood Properties, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6429)|
| 1:47:14| as receiver for 1100 LLC to provide additional police services at Town View Towers Apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6434)|
| 1:47:21| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6441)|
| 1:47:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6442)|
| 1:47:23| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6443)|
| 1:47:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6444)|
| 1:47:25| I'd like to ask the chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6445)|
| 1:47:26| I assume that you're having a lot of problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6446)|
| 1:47:29| That's in my district, Town View.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6449)|
| 1:47:30| Are there a lot of problems occurring there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6450)|
| 1:47:34| Not a lot, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6454)|
| 1:47:35| And what this is is we are in a contract with them now providing off-duty services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6455)|
| 1:47:41| So this is extra patrols that we provide to that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6461)|
| 1:47:45| So it's working, and they want to continue to have it working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6465)|
| 1:47:49| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6469)|

| 1:47:54| David may have answered the question already, but do these guys work on their own in contract for the individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6474)|
| 1:48:00| or the city is furnishing them as city employees that work, I guess, for a paycheck from the other entity, Wood Properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6480)|
| 1:48:09| They contract with the city for overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6489)|

| 1:50:14| Councilman Dela Vofe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| Mark sat here patiently all night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6615)|
| 1:50:17| Can you spend one minute and tell us, or maybe it's Bob Wetzel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6617)|
| 1:50:21| what kind of plan activity we're going to be engaged in just so we understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6621)|
| 1:50:25| What we're doing tonight is asking KCDC to move forward with the creation of a district to explore that concept.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6625)|
| 1:50:32| We're looking at potentially a TIF district where any new TIF funding that comes in will go towards public improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6632)|
| 1:50:40| KCDC has to actually make that determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| KCDC will take this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6642)|
| 1:50:44| They will review it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6644)|
| 1:50:45| They will go through the public hearing process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6645)|
| 1:50:47| They will report back to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6647)|
| 1:50:49| We hope that we can get this all done by the end of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6649)|
| 1:50:52| So if we do a TIF district and then we capture the 2012 taxes at this point in time, not 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6652)|
| 1:50:59| and then we'll have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6659)|
| 1:51:00| The big picture is that we will develop some funds to help us support public parking in the Cumberland Corridor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6660)|
| 1:51:06| That's what we're really driving towards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6666)|
| 1:51:08| That's the ultimate goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6668)|
| 1:51:10| As you work your way through the issues on that part of town, that's what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6670)|
| 1:51:14| Everyone's been asking about the parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6676)|
| 1:51:17| We'll try to address it with this approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6677)|
| 1:51:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6679)|
| 1:51:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6680)|
| 1:51:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6681)|
| 1:51:22| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6682)|
| 1:51:23| Yes, Bob, I want to ask you a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| Whenever I hear about urban renewal, I get a little nervous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6685)|
| 1:51:31| Certainly, as a student of history, I understand that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6691)|
| 1:51:34| Is that going to require some purchasing of private property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6694)|
| 1:51:38| Do you anticipate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6698)|
| 1:51:39| Or what do we mean by this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| Certainly, we don't anticipate condemning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6702)|
| 1:51:44| and taking property for any public benefit at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6704)|
| 1:51:47| It might happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6707)|
| 1:51:48| We certainly don't anticipate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6708)|
| 1:51:50| If we are to build a parking garage, we'll have to have the land to put it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6710)|
| 1:51:52| So we would have to purchase land to do that in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6712)|
| 1:51:55| This will be a as we've done all of our most recent urban renewal plans in the last decade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6715)|
| 1:52:01| this is one where we work with the property owners in trying to accomplish our objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6721)|
| 1:52:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6725)|
| 1:52:06| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6726)|
| 1:52:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6727)|
| 1:52:08| We will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6728)|
| 1:52:09| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6729)|
| 1:52:10| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| Bob, you know I'm concerned about parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6731)|
| 1:52:13| and we had the issue with the project that's coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6733)|
| 1:52:16| that I would hope that there would be some way that when we look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6736)|
| 1:52:19| and we look at Cumberland Avenue that we look at the development that is going to take place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6739)|
| 1:52:24| and how they may tie into, whether it's financial or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6744)|
| 1:52:28| in terms of any kind of parking that may go on in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6748)|
| 1:52:31| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6751)|
| 1:52:32| Of course, that's the next one up on your agenda tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6752)|
| 1:52:34| And there's one reason that's a five-year pilot request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6754)|
| 1:52:38| If they would roll out, we think at that point in time the taxes would be frozen at this point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6758)|
| 1:52:42| until that new development happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6764)|
| 1:52:45| And it's a five-year instead of 10, 15, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6765)|
| 1:52:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6767)|
| 1:52:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6770)|
| 1:52:51| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6771)|
| 1:52:52| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6772)|
| 1:52:53| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6773)|
| 1:52:54| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6774)|
| 1:52:55| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6775)|
| 1:52:56| 11H is a resolution authorizing the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6776)|
| 1:53:00| to negotiate and accept from campus investors Knoxville LLC payments in lieu of ad valorem taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6780)|
| 1:53:06| with respect to property located at 2010 Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6786)|
| 1:53:09| and finding that such payments are deemed to be in furtherance of the public purposes of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6789)|
| 1:53:14| as defined in Tennessee Code Annotated Section 753.305.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6800)|
| 1:53:22| We have multiple motions, but wait for the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6802)|
| 1:53:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6806)|
| 1:53:27| Councilman Del Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6807)|
| 1:53:28| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6808)|
| 1:53:30| You may have already answered this in the last question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6810)|
| 1:53:34| but as I read this, campus acquisitions would like to make 8% return, not the 7.19% return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6814)|
| 1:53:43| and why is that a matter of public interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6823)|
| 1:53:47| It's not like they're not getting a loan if they don't make 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6827)|
| 1:53:51| It sort of sounds like they want to profit at a certain level to get a good value for their money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6831)|
| 1:53:56| or a good return on investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6836)|
| 1:53:58| Why should that warrant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6838)|
| 1:54:00| We need to get into the real details of those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6840)|
| 1:54:02| Steve Buss with Campus Acquisitions here, and I'll ask him to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6842)|
| 1:54:05| Let me just tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6845)|
| 1:54:06| In the general terms, the public benefit is the project doesn't happen unless they get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6846)|
| 1:54:11| We want this $18 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6851)|

| 1:54:14| It's a go, no-go situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6854)|
| 1:54:16| If you have to close on the property, there's two outstanding things that have to happen before they close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6856)|
| 1:54:22| This pilot has to be approved, and there also has to be something working with the property owner there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6862)|
| 1:54:27| that they have to give up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6867)|
| 1:54:28| So you don't think we're just easy giving away free money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6868)|
| 1:54:31| No, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6871)|
| 1:54:32| I would also mention at this point in time that the service station has been paying $9,000 a year in taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6872)|
| 1:54:37| because of negotiations in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6877)|
| 1:54:39| We'll be receiving, the city will be receiving $25,000 a year immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6879)|
| 1:54:44| The county will be receiving almost $25,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6884)|
| 1:54:47| And the term is five years and not ten?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6887)|
| 1:54:49| Just for five years, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6890)|
| 1:54:51| We want to ensure that this development takes off and we start to transform Cumberland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6891)|
| 1:54:55| And I'd like to make a 10% return, but I don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6895)|
| 1:55:02| Put a lot of money up for a big investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6902)|
| 1:55:06| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6906)|
| 1:55:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6907)|
| 1:55:08| Again, Bob, I just want to reiterate the fact that I know when the project started it was much higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6908)|
| 1:55:13| and there were several levels of parking, so they reduced the height of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6913)|
| 1:55:16| but they also reduced one of the parking levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| I think that we just need to be real careful as we develop Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6919)|
| 1:55:24| that parking is taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6924)|
| 1:55:26| We already know what the problems are down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6926)|
| 1:55:28| and I hate to see us develop so much that it puts the burden totally on the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6928)|
| 1:55:34| in terms of parking in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6934)|
| 1:55:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6936)|
| 1:55:37| I think we have a chance to do it differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6937)|
| 1:55:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6938)|
| 1:55:39| And we'll be working in that direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6939)|
| 1:55:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6940)|
| 1:55:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6942)|
| 1:55:43| Good discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6944)|
| 1:55:45| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6945)|
| 1:55:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6946)|
| 1:55:47| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6947)|
| 1:55:48| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6948)|
| 1:55:49| Item A is an ordinance to amend Chapter 2, Article 8, Division 1, Section 2-806 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6949)|
| 1:55:55| so as to clarify that temporary construction easements requiring an expenditure of $25,000 or less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6955)|
| 1:56:02| shall not require specific approval by city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6966)|
| 1:56:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6967)|
| 1:56:08| Councilman Dalibopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6968)|
| 1:56:09| Yeah, Jim York, I think, patiently stayed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| Is he still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6971)|
| 1:56:12| Actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| Oh, we've got voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6973)|
| 1:56:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6975)|
| 1:56:17| I understand this since we're talking about temporary construction easements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| we're trying to simplify the process of getting the work underway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6980)|
| 1:56:25| Here's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6985)|
| 1:56:27| What if we have 10 parcels and each of them are under $25,000 but in the aggregate they're much more than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6987)|
| 1:56:34| Are you still going to slide them in one by one and do that or do they come to council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=6994)|
| 1:56:40| In other words, should there be some aggregate look at the project activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7000)|
| 1:56:44| and if the temporary construction easements in aggregator are significantly more than $25,000, you bring it to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7004)|
| 1:56:51| Or is this just a way of simplifying the task| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7011)|
| 1:56:55| and we don't look at the whole project and how much money is being spent in the process of trying to get the work done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7015)|
| 1:57:05| Sir, the Boyce-Evans 228 Braden Court, Clinton, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7025)|
| 1:57:09| The ordinance or amendment to the ordinance that you have in front of you proposed, that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7029)|
| 1:57:17| would take each one on an individual basis and not look at them all in aggregate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7037)|
| 1:57:24| Let me give you real quick though some background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| I took a look at these over the past 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7047)|
| 1:57:31| We executed 21 each temporary construction easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7051)|
| 1:57:38| 17 of those were well below $25,000 in value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7058)|
| 1:57:44| The average cost of them comes out to about $7,700 and some change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7064)|
| 1:57:52| Honestly, it's just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7072)|
| 1:57:53| The cost of doing business, of getting the work done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7075)|
| 1:57:56| The bottom line is we just feel like it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7076)|
| 1:57:59| There's two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7079)|
| 1:58:00| One, in y'all's interest, we look at it as this body is something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7080)|
| 1:58:06| It's probably below your noise level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| Let's put these temporary construction easements at the procurement threshold limit, which is $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7088)|
| 1:58:16| Second thing, if we do that, it'll expedite some of the projects we're working on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7096)|
| 1:58:23| take out another step in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7103)|
| 1:58:25| For instance, I know Mr. Wetzel's got probably upwards of 50 coming this way for the Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7105)|
| 1:58:34| Now, a bunch of those will be above $25,000 by virtue of where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7114)|
| 1:58:39| But the reality is this is the disruption we cause the landowner while we're doing our work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7119)|
| 1:58:45| and then it goes back to normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7125)|
| 1:58:46| He keeps that portion of his parcel, and it's sort of like moving a tractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7126)|
| 1:58:52| And this body will still approve, whether it's one cent or $100 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7132)|
| 1:58:59| every real property transaction, you know, permanent easements of any type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7139)|
| 1:59:05| It's an interim use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7145)|
| 1:59:06| That's all it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7146)|
| 1:59:07| It's just the temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7147)|
| 1:59:08| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7150)|
| 1:59:11| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7152)|
| 1:59:13| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7153)|
| 1:59:14| Along those lines, could you not periodically, say quarterly, just send us a review of these projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| instead of us having to look at them, excuse me, individually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7159)|
| 1:59:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7161)|
| 1:59:22| We can easily do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7162)|
| 1:59:23| That serves the same purpose in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7163)|
| 1:59:26| Yeah, quarterly we can copy you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| And we'll just send out a memorandum to all council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7169)|
| 1:59:33| That's not a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7173)|
| 1:59:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7174)|
| 1:59:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7175)|
| 1:59:36| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7176)|
| 1:59:37| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7177)|
| 1:59:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7178)|
| 1:59:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7179)|
| 1:59:40| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7180)|
| 1:59:41| 12B is an ordinance appropriating the sum of $750 from the Parks and Recreation Department funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7181)|
| 1:59:46| and donating the same to GFWC Ossoli Circle to be utilized for the Celebration Bench Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7186)|
| 1:59:53| in city parks and on city greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7195)|
| 1:59:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7196)|
| 1:59:57| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7197)|

| 2:00:00| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7200)|
| 2:00:01| Nobody has signed up for public comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7201)|
| 2:00:02| I think we ought to take 15 minutes a piece and just thank Eddie personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7202)|
| 2:00:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7206)|
| 2:00:07| For staying here to the very end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7207)|
| 2:00:10| And give Nick 30 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7210)|
| 2:00:13| Make him speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7213)|
| 2:00:15| Make Eddie speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| That's what I'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7216)|
| 2:00:17| Filibuster here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7217)|
| 2:00:19| Eddie, would you like to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7219)|
| 2:00:21| I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7221)|
| 2:00:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7222)|
| 2:00:23| I've appreciated my time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7223)|
| 2:00:24| It has actually been 19 months, and I appreciate working with Mayor O'Hare and the staff that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7224)|
| 2:00:29| she has put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7229)|
| 2:00:30| And it has been a pleasure working with City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7230)|
| 2:00:32| I've enjoyed every minute of every City Council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7232)|
| 2:00:37| Every single minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7237)|
| 2:00:40| Amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7240)|
| 2:00:41| It's kind of like a root canal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7241)|
| 2:00:42| You're really liking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7242)|
| 2:00:44| And I will be in public forum every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7244)|
| 2:00:48| Thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7248)|
| 2:00:50| We will look forward to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7250)|
| 2:00:51| However, since there's nobody signed up tonight, there being no further business, this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130528?start=7251)|
