| 0:07:57| First, I'll start by saying, as allowed by Governor Lee's executive orders, in response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless I hear objection, I'm going to rule that, by acclamation, Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=482)|

| 0:08:13| Seeing no objections, let's move on to my mayor's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| So, first, nice to see everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=497)|
| 0:08:21| I want to let you know some good news, in case you hadn't heard about Jackson Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| ramps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| I'm really pleased to announce that the Jackson Avenue ramps connecting Gay Street with businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=506)|
| 0:08:30| in the Old City and along the West Jackson Corridor are now officially open to both pedestrians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| and vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| You'll probably recall that the ramps were 100-year-old pieces of infrastructure, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=517)|
| 0:08:41| they were in deep need of repair, and yet they had a lot of architectural interest and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=521)|
| 0:08:46| value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=526)|
| 0:08:47| The emerging ramps have now been fully replaced with modern, safety-engineered ramps that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=527)|
| 0:08:51| replicate the look and feel of the vintage originals, including reuse of the trademark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=531)|
| 0:08:56| 100-year-old red brick pavers that so many of us have grown fond of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=536)|
| 0:09:00| So, thanks to the partnership with federal and state governments, local dollars of less| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| than $300,000 leveraged funding of over $8 million to make this update possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| The value of this investment compounds with the reinvestment we've already seen along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| the Jackson Avenue and in the Old City, with more on the horizon, such as the eventual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| revitalization of the McClellan-Newham site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| I encourage you to check this area out and visit the many businesses, some well-established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| and some newer, that populate what has become quite a vibrant and interesting section of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=566)|
| 0:09:31| our downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| Next, I wanted to share with you a few thoughts about the challenges and opportunities that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=572)|
| 0:09:38| exist within and beyond our downtown core, and I want to address some of the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=578)|
| 0:09:43| and concerns I've heard about homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| Connecting those who experience or are at risk of homelessness with stable, quality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| housing is, of course, as you well know, an ongoing priority of this city and its council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=590)|
| 0:09:57| It's one that the city has supported with over $6.8 million in combined local, federal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| and state funding just in the last 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| We have over 100 programs operating locally that provide a continuum of care to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| this challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=610)|
| 0:10:12| Although the number fluctuates at any given time, there are roughly 800 people in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=612)|
| 0:10:16| experiencing homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=616)|
| 0:10:18| The majority, over 75%, connect with shelter on a nightly basis, whether through service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| providers or through personal support networks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| A much smaller percentage, slightly less than 25%, are living unsheltered, often in tents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=626)|
| 0:10:31| or other makeshift shelters that can't provide the basic levels of health, safety and sanitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=631)|
| 0:10:36| required for long-term human habitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| While the city does not own or operate any shelters, we do support numerous partners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=639)|

| 0:10:48| in encampments to shelter and services, such as drug treatment programs, health care, job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=648)|

| 0:10:55| Pathways towards eventual permanent housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| Especially during extremely cold weather, it is even more essential for unhoused people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| to find indoor shelter in a place that protects them from the elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=662)|
| 0:11:06| There are available beds at our shelters, including at the low barrier shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| And let me remind you, I'm sure you all know, but during periods of extreme temperatures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| our largest shelters, Harm, Salvation Army, VMC, participate in white flag protocols,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=675)|

| 0:11:33| and effective strategies will continue to be a complex and community-wide challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| It demands partnership, perseverance, and also good information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| Unfortunately, there's been some misleading information circulating as of late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| And so to help advance productive conversation, there's now an FAQ, Frequently Asked Questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=706)|

| 0:14:27| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| You asked really hard ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=870)|

| 0:15:34| So that's all that I have today, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=934)|

| 0:16:03| that I would like to bring before you soon, hopefully, that I hope will address some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=963)|
| 0:16:10| the folks who are falling through the cracks in our community, who are unhoused, who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=970)|
| 0:16:17| nowhere to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| There are policies that we have in place that don't address all situations that folks are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| dealing with, and we've had new guidance that have come out from Ninth District Court is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=984)|
| 0:16:30| one of them that have found that certain conditions need to be in place to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=990)|
| 0:16:39| what housing is available in our city adequate for those who are unhoused, so better defining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=999)|
| 0:16:46| what adequate housing is, and making sure we have plans in place for those who, for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1006)|
| 0:16:51| instance, with the white flag policy, if you have housing for one night because it's cold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1011)|
| 0:16:57| but then you need a sleeping bag the next night because it's not cold and you're not able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1017)|
| 0:17:01| to stay there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| What is our plan for folks like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| So I'm hoping to bring something forward soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1024)|
| 0:17:06| I'm working with Rob on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1026)|
| 0:17:08| Just wanted to give you all a heads up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| Thank you, Councilmember Platt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1030)|
| 0:17:12| Any other reports from councilmembers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| Councilmember Sanders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1039)|
| 0:17:20| I just didn't raise my hand fast enough after your report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| I just had a couple questions about the homeless camps and the questions that I so often get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1044)|
| 0:17:33| about why is the city doing sweeps, and I know yesterday at the homeless roundtable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1053)|
| 0:17:39| that was addressed a little bit, that it's complaint-driven, and I wondered if there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1059)|
| 0:17:47| somebody on this call that could talk about what kind of complaints are being made and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| how this gets instigated and why the sweeps, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1078)|
| 0:18:00| I'll initiate the answer, and then if we want to have a little more detail, I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| probably best if we have it in a workshop unless there's a real short answer that someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| can provide, but it's complaints from nearby neighbors and businesses about crime, about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1091)|
| 0:18:19| waste and litter and other issues of human and drug trafficking and pollution and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1099)|
| 0:18:27| sort of thing, and also some of the complaints are based on encampments that are on private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1107)|
| 0:18:33| property, so it's trespassing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| So those are the nature of the complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| I don't have a total log.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| Yeah, that's the nature of the complaints.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1124)|
| 0:18:47| I don't have a list of all of them, but again, that's a good, if you want to unpack that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| a little more and find out the details, I think that's a good topic for a workshop where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1132)|
| 0:18:58| we can ask 311 and KPD and public service to say how many and how often, but I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1138)|
| 0:19:06| the mayor's office gets complaints from businesses and people expressing concern about it, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1146)|
| 0:19:12| maybe some of you do as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| So we can, if you all want, we can have a workshop to go into more details about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| but I don't have those ready at my fingertips right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| Councilmember Ryan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1165)|
| 0:19:34| You're unmuted, but we still couldn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1176)|
| 0:19:37| Can you hear me now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| I have asked for a workshop, and I thought we were getting scheduled for a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| so I would definitely like to ask for that, and I would also like to suggest that maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1183)|
| 0:19:51| we invite county commission members to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1191)|
| 0:19:54| I don't know if we can schedule with them, but some of them have had questions about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| homeless services, and so I think that could be beneficial to get them involved and supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1199)|
| 0:20:07| of the services as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1209)|

| 0:20:18| it at a good time, it works for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1218)|
| 0:20:21| It works for people who want it, and so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1225)|
| 0:20:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1226)|

| 0:20:31| This isn't an official report, but I did want to just congratulate Councilmember Fugitt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1231)|

| 0:28:32| Thanks for letting us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Mr. Smith, I see that you're attending our meeting, and we appreciate your work in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1713)|
| 0:28:41| city, and I wondered if you wanted to address Council on this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1721)|
| 0:28:46| I'm going to let Lawrence Tulloch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1726)|
| 0:28:48| He's the one that's kind of spearheaded this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1728)|
| 0:28:50| I come on to make sure that I could support or answer any questions you guys would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1730)|
| 0:28:54| of me, but he's going to have the bulk of the information from our side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1734)|
| 0:28:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1739)|
| 0:29:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1740)|
| 0:29:01| Mr. Tulloch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1742)|
| 0:29:03| First of all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1743)|
| 0:29:04| Can you start by stating your name and address for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| And I'll get to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| We'll go back to Mr. Smith in a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1749)|
| 0:29:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| Jeff Lawrence Tulloch, 333 West Depot Avenue, Apartment 621, downtown Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1752)|
| 0:29:19| And very, very glad to be with you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| We'll be glad to take any questions you have on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| It is a project of Fourth Purpose Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1765)|
| 0:29:28| The real estate development arm of Fourth Purpose Foundation is Fourth Purpose Realty, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| That's a nonprofit limited liability company just formed to protect the foundation from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1773)|
| 0:29:41| any liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| This is going to be a project called Dogen Gaither Flats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| It's 16 residential units, the renovation of the former Dogen Gaither Motor Court, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1787)|
| 0:29:53| was an incredibly important asset of this community during the time of segregation as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1793)|
| 0:29:59| the most important hotel or motel during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1799)|
| 0:30:06| It will be supportive housing for ex-offenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| There will be potentially two ex-offenders in each of the units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1809)|
| 0:30:16| It will be affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1816)|
| 0:30:17| It will be supportive in the sense that it will be run by Men of Valor, our operating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| partner on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| The typical recidivism rate in America approaches 70%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1824)|
| 0:30:29| In Tennessee, it's 51%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| In units that Men of Valor run in Nashville, their recidivism rate is 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1832)|
| 0:30:39| So, the folks that live here will be placed in jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| They'll be in counseling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| They'll be in accountability groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| They'll be in training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| But the dominant portion of the real estate development, of course, is that they'll be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1849)|
| 0:30:53| provided affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1853)|
| 0:30:55| I'd be glad to take any questions you might have on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1855)|
| 0:30:58| But thank you so much for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| Thank you, Mr. Tellick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1861)|
| 0:31:03| And thank you, Mr. Smith, for your work on this project and work on criminal justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1863)|
| 0:31:08| reform in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| That's really good stuff, and we appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1869)|
| 0:31:12| It's making a positive difference in the lives of many Knoxville residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1872)|
| 0:31:16| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| Any questions for Mr. Tellick or Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| Seeing none, we'll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1881)|
| 0:31:25| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1888)|
| 0:31:29| I didn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1889)|
| 0:31:30| Ms. Parker, question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1890)|
| 0:31:31| I was reading through the packet and had a few questions about the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1891)|
| 0:31:39| I see that there are some requirements for the residents who would live here, counseling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1899)|
| 0:31:47| program that they would have to participate in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1907)|
| 0:31:50| Are these faith-based programs that they're required to participate in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| The Men of Valor is a faith-based nonprofit, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1915)|
| 0:32:01| And I guess this is a question for the city more so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1921)|
| 0:32:07| We are able to allocate public funding to a faith-based program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| The allocation, Councilwoman Parker, would actually be to the real estate development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1932)|
| 0:32:17| which makes the units affordable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| The operating partner, Men of Valor, is a lessee of ours in the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1939)|
| 0:32:27| Those dollars would not go directly to Men of Valor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| Thank you for that clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1951)|
| 0:32:33| Thank you, Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1953)|
| 0:32:36| Any further questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| Mayor, if I could, thank you for your kind words at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| I didn't want to overstep with Lawrence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| He's the one that's been on the front line of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| But to correct one of his data points, one of the things I learned being on the governor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1971)|
| 0:33:01| criminal justice task force this last year, then ended up on Knox County's criminal justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1981)|
| 0:33:07| task force is, in our state, it's actually about 47%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| In Knox County, Knox County has the worst recidivism rate of our entire state at over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=1992)|
| 0:33:20| 70%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Knox County, which is very shocking to me, matter of fact, I didn't even believe it when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| I heard it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2007)|
| 0:33:28| I thought it was misdone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2008)|
| 0:33:29| I went and dove into a lot of the data to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| But it is, in fact, the truth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2012)|
| 0:33:35| Knox County rates worse in several things, including females being incarcerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2015)|
| 0:33:43| Our state actually is one of the top, I think, top five states, don't quote me on that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2023)|
| 0:33:50| in female incarceration rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| And so, Knox County is a place, and I'm really just sharing this Morris data point for everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2032)|
| 0:33:58| Knox County is way behind in our state and in the country of recidivism rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2038)|
| 0:34:03| And hopefully, this program will encourage others to do more programs and give more support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| to do things like this to be able to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| And the transition going from prison out is just a brutal process that most don't end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2051)|
| 0:34:19| up in housing that can be close to services or in an area that they can receive those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2065)|
| 0:34:26| So, I'm excited about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2066)|
| 0:34:29| I'm, you know, we've obviously invested a lot there through the foundation, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2069)|
| 0:34:34| a project that, you know, I think just well worth, exciting one for our community, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2074)|
| 0:34:39| my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| Thank you so much, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2080)|

| 0:34:44| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| Can I ask some questions, Mr. Smith, maybe, or Mr. Tulloch, about the staffing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2085)|
| 0:34:52| So, there'll be one staff member in the live-in apartment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| There will be one staff member in the live-in apartment, but Men of Valor will have three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| staff members supporting the program there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2105)|
| 0:35:06| So, you conduct some of the programming and structured assistance for the residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2106)|
| 0:35:15| Yes, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2115)|
| 0:35:17| One of the main things, of course, is the job placement and job training, and then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2117)|
| 0:35:23| second part of the accountability groups and the life skills training, but just holding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2123)|
| 0:35:31| the residents accountable, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2131)|
| 0:35:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| Mr. Smith, you cited the recidivism rate for Knox County being the worst in the entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2140)|
| 0:35:41| Was there a logic as to why that's so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| So, I went and actually visited Memphis, and I've been asking a lot of questions of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2146)|
| 0:35:51| because living here, that was an important statistic for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2151)|
| 0:35:56| And what it appears to be is that in Memphis, you would think, and I think most of us would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| assume that Memphis would be the worst recidivism rate, but Memphis, over the years, has really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2161)|
| 0:36:07| acknowledged what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2167)|
| 0:36:08| So, you have a lot of support services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2168)|
| 0:36:10| You have a lot of things being able to help support people in those situations, whereas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| Knox County, in our area, you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| We have meetings every once in a while, and everybody gets together and feels really good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2178)|
| 0:36:23| about the data, the information they share, and then it leaves them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2183)|
| 0:36:27| There's real no active movement on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| People aren't taking the lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| They're not helping these people find jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| I sold my company that had about, I think, 180 employees, many of which, I mean, I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2196)|
| 0:36:43| obviously the pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2203)|
| 0:36:44| I was able to build that company by hiring many of those and giving them opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2204)|
| 0:36:49| and giving chances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| But I can tell you, there's many of them that I wasn't able to hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| And so, there needs to be more symposiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| There needs to be more education on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2216)|
| 0:36:58| There needs to be awareness that people are out there, and not just saying no when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| have a felony conviction or something like that, just really educating the public about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| it, like Memphis has done a great job doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2229)|
| 0:37:11| They've got a lot of employment programs, a lot of things that help people move through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2236)|
| 0:37:17| And, you know, my friend John Hope Bryant would say, there's nothing that stops a bullet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2237)|
| 0:37:22| like a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| I mean, nothing stops a bullet like a job, you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| And so, when people are employed and they're able to take care of their families, they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| able to do those things, it makes a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| And I would just say supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| It just kills our area, and being able to have support with that as you transition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| instead of going straight to the streets in housing that you're sharing with somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2262)|
| 0:37:46| else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2266)|
| 0:37:47| It's a big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2267)|
| 0:37:48| Thank you for highlighting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| I know that one of the most important things is good support to make a program work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2270)|
| 0:37:56| So, the staffing, that's why I asked about the staffing and what the support would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2276)|
| 0:38:01| like, because that's critical to success for these folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| Their receiving rate is 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2284)|
| 0:38:06| So, if you go to that program, it's only 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2286)|
| 0:38:10| So, it's a big problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| That's a pretty effective program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2295)|

| 0:38:21| Go ahead, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| Is there a length of time that the lease is already contractually obligated for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2305)|
| 0:38:32| Why don't I let you address that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| Council Member Thomas, the initial term is 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2319)|

| 0:38:45| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2325)|
| 0:38:46| I just want to briefly thank Mr. Smith for his commitment in this program and the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2326)|
| 0:38:53| that he's done in trying to help transform lives and help people have a platform and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2333)|
| 0:38:59| a supportive environment to be able to transition back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| And so, I just wanted to take this opportunity to thank you for that commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2342)|
| 0:39:06| And then also, when I look at the location where it is essentially located to bus services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2346)|
| 0:39:12| and also opportunities, walkability for jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| And so, just continued success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| And thank you again for your commitment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2358)|

| 0:39:23| Any other questions or comments or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| Oh, just a brief comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| I would echo Vice Mayor's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| And this seems to be very well thought out, very practical, obviously very needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| And the idea of repurposing a building that has some kind of a historic roots as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2376)|
| 0:39:42| The whole package seems very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2382)|

| 0:45:08| Mayor, I wanted to ask if Erin Gail or someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| could just provide us a high-level overview of the timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2713)|

| 0:45:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2722)|

| 0:45:25| Mr. Kannon, if you could give us an overview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| of the timeline of this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| Forgive me, folks, fat fingers tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| As noted in the council packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| the intent is to have this project done in October of 2025.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| It will have to go through the various TDOT processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| including NEPA review of the construction documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| any right-of-way acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2753)|
| 0:45:55| and then we will go to construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| Basically following the same pattern, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| as phases one and two did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| I apologize, I'm not sure the exact schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| of the previous phases, Vice Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| but I will be happy to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| But there is a standard process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2771)|
| 0:46:12| we will continue to have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2772)|
| 0:46:14| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| And so just for the benefit for those that did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| you know, that's watching,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| that don't have access to our information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2778)|

| 0:46:25| Okay, any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| Council Member Padley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2788)|
| 0:46:29| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2789)|
| 0:46:32| Do we have a, do we anticipate how many phases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2792)|
| 0:46:37| for the corridor project there will be at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2797)|
| 0:46:46| Director Cannon, can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| I believe right now there is a total of five phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| I will confirm that for you, Councilwoman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| I believe the next two phases may be done concurrently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2815)|
| 0:46:59| but let me get back with you on that, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| That would be great,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2825)|
| 0:47:06| because I remember when this project was first announced,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| my concern was that we would never make it to Cherry Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2830)|
| 0:47:13| And I thought we were supposed to make it to Cherry Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| by the third phase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2836)|
| 0:47:17| but please correct me on that if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| That's my concern is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| I can't speak to why we have not gotten to Cherry Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2843)|
| 0:47:27| I can tell you there's been extensive discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2847)|
| 0:47:30| about the goal of getting to Cherry Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| I'm not sure what the holdup was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2853)|
| 0:47:35| but I can promise you that that goal is front and center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2855)|

| 0:48:44| existing Acela Citizen Access Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2924)|

| 0:48:50| for an initial implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2930)|

| 0:49:20| Yeah, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2960)|
| 0:49:21| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2961)|
| 0:49:22| Slow in raising my hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| I've just had a few phone calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2965)|
| 0:49:26| about people getting permits and the difficulty of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| and then especially how procedure had to change during COVID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| and I believe this is supposed to assist with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| Could someone address why we're implementing this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| and if this is something that will indeed help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2980)|
| 0:49:45| with not being in person?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| Okay, Mr. Ahrens, could you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2991)|
| 0:49:52| Peter Ahrens, Director of Plans Review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2992)|
| 0:49:53| and Building Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2993)|
| 0:49:56| Yes, prior to COVID, we had been ramping up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| transitioning from paper plans to electronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| Through COVID and our malware incident,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| we basically were forced into 100% electronic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3006)|
| 0:50:12| This front-end tool is intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3012)|
| 0:50:14| to really help people understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3014)|
| 0:50:17| what permits they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| and really guide them straight through the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| so that there's less confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3022)|
| 0:50:24| We're really trying to make it easier for folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3024)|
| 0:50:26| to not only get their permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| but know what permits they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| So that's the intention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3031)|
| 0:50:34| and we've been working with the IT department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3034)|
| 0:50:37| We've vetted several programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3037)|
| 0:50:39| and we felt like this one would be best suited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3039)|
| 0:50:44| I'm glad you're doing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3044)|
| 0:50:45| because I know it is a very complicated process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3045)|
| 0:50:47| and confusing for a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3049)|
| 0:50:52| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3052)|
| 0:50:53| Council Member Kesterman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3053)|
| 0:50:54| And I just wanna piggyback| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| on what Council Member Singh said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3056)|
| 0:50:58| that I'm thrilled that this is moving forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3058)|
| 0:51:01| to make this process more user-friendly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3061)|
| 0:51:04| and making the process more expeditious as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3064)|
| 0:51:08| So glad to see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3068)|
| 0:51:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3071)|
| 0:51:12| Mr. Council Member Roberto and then Roger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3075)|
| 0:51:17| Director Aarons, just clarifying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3077)|
| 0:51:20| certainly sounds like this is kind of a customer-centric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3080)|
| 0:51:25| vision you're putting in with this software,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3085)|
| 0:51:27| but this is ease of use for neighbors, neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| as well as developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3090)|
| 0:51:31| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3091)|
| 0:51:33| Yeah, it's really intended to help everybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3093)|
| 0:51:35| navigate through our process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| And understandably, our processes are difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| Not everybody's into the building industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3102)|
| 0:51:44| and understands building codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3104)|
| 0:51:46| And so this is intended to basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3106)|
| 0:51:50| what we've been trying to do is similar to TurboTax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| where people don't necessarily know the tax code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3113)|
| 0:51:55| but they can jump in TurboTax, answer the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3115)|
| 0:51:57| and get to the right forms and get the right answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3117)|
| 0:52:01| So that's really what we're pushing for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| And we're anticipating this will really help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| get a lot closer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3127)|
| 0:52:08| I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| And I definitely support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| Council Member Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| Yeah, Mr. Aarons, I think in past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3134)|
| 0:52:18| somewhere along the line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| we've talked about things like in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| they're able to, you're able to look and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3142)|
| 0:52:25| what permits are in the queue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| or what permits have been permitted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| which I know you can do if you know the permit number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| to plug into the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| Is there ever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3154)|
| 0:52:38| do we have intention to add that capability on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| at some point down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3161)|
| 0:52:42| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| I can't answer that specifically right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3164)|
| 0:52:47| Okay, but it's a different product.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| It's not like an add on to the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3168)|
| 0:52:51| I don't believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| That is one thing that we're really looking into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| because we do wanna be transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3175)|
| 0:52:56| We wanna make sure that people have access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| really all the data to make sure that they can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3180)|
| 0:53:03| where development is happening, how it's progressing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3183)|
| 0:53:07| and not necessarily just the individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| who are making application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3189)|
| 0:53:11| but those that are interested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| in what's happening in their community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| But also, so now they call and tie up staff time too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3194)|
| 0:53:18| That's the other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3198)|
| 0:53:19| It'll help on both ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| Transparency as well as staff time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210126?start=3204)|
