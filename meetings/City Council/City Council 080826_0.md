| 0:00:00| Okay, I'd like to go ahead and call the August 26th regular meeting of City Council to order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=0)|
| 0:00:06| We will begin with an invocation from Mrs. Pelow and a pledge led by Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=6)|
| 0:00:11| And before I ask that we bow our heads tonight, I just have a special something on my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=11)|
| 0:00:22| and I wanted to share it with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=22)|
| 0:00:24| Over the weekend, we had occasion to go and visit the Lincoln Memorial University, Lincoln Museum there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=24)|
| 0:00:33| It was a wonderful experience, but then we drove on up to Cumberland Gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=33)|
| 0:00:37| and it was just such a magnificent day on Saturday and so gorgeous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=37)|
| 0:00:43| And then on Sunday, I had the opportunity to go to the East Tennessee Historical Society Museum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=43)|
| 0:00:50| on our very own Gay Street and just see who we are as East Tennesseans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=50)|
| 0:00:58| and to give some deep thought to where we've come from and who we are and who we represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=58)|
| 0:01:07| So it was a wonderful, enriching experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=67)|
| 0:01:10| and I hope some of the folks that are listening will take that same little pilgrimage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=70)|
| 0:01:14| because it can be very, very meaningful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=74)|
| 0:01:17| You'll bow your heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=77)|
| 0:01:19| Our Father, we are so indeed grateful for the beauty of this land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=79)|
| 0:01:25| for the voices of this land and what they tell us about who we are and what you would have us be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=85)|
| 0:01:36| It's awesome indeed to think of those who have gone before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| and all of the wonderful foundation they have laid for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| We pray that you will help us to be living lives of praise and meaningful lives of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=104)|
| 0:01:52| that we may continue that tradition and that you may use us for your glory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=120)|
| 0:02:07| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=127)|
| 0:02:13| with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=133)|
| 0:02:20| Thank you. Ms. Mitchell, if you'd call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=140)|

| 0:02:35| Councilman Woodhull. Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| Thank you. Vice Mayor Brown asked if I'd extend his apologies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| He had to be in North Carolina with his son tonight and tomorrow and wishes he could be with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=160)|
| 0:02:46| Okay. Next item is the approval of the minutes of our last meeting of August 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| Is there a motion to approve those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| Any questions or discussions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=173)|
| 0:02:55| Okay. All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=175)|
| 0:02:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| Opposed, no. Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=178)|
| 0:03:02| Items dealing with the agenda. Any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=182)|
| 0:03:06| Ms. Pelow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=186)|
| 0:03:09| I would move that item number 10A and 11J be withdrawn from the agenda at the request of the developer who was involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=189)|
| 0:03:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=200)|
| 0:03:22| Moved and seconded to withdraw 10A and 11J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=202)|
| 0:03:28| Any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| Okay. All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=212)|
| 0:03:33| Opposed, no. It's withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=213)|
| 0:03:35| Anything else to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| Okay. Items for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=217)|
| 0:03:40| Mr. Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=220)|
| 0:03:42| Yes. Item 9R, as in RAN or RED or whatever, I'd like to postpone that for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=222)|
| 0:03:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| Okay. Moved and seconded to postpone 9R for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=236)|
| 0:03:59| Are there any questions about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=239)|
| 0:04:02| Okay. All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=242)|
| 0:04:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=244)|
| 0:04:05| Opposed, no. 9R is postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=245)|
| 0:04:08| Anything else for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=251)|
| 0:04:13| Thank you. I think we'll need to postpone item 9B, as in BLUE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=253)|
| 0:04:17| That's dealing with EMCs because we haven't been able to have our workshop yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=257)|
| 0:04:22| And to be honest, I forgot. Do we have workshops yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=262)|
| 0:04:25| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| The fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| So we need to postpone for two weeks' time, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| Okay. The motion and the second from Ms. Roddy was to postpone for two weeks 9B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=270)|
| 0:04:34| dealing with electronic message centers. I'll get it out eventually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=274)|
| 0:04:40| Any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=280)|
| 0:04:42| Okay. All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=284)|
| 0:04:45| Opposed, no. Okay. Postpone. Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| I'd like to propose a postponement of item 12A, and I know Ms. Pelos serves on the record commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=289)|
| 0:04:55| I received an e-mail and also a letter in my packet tonight from the McGovern Law Firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| and evidently there are some folks with a vested interest in this who could not be here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| and we're asking for a two-week postponement so that they could be present during consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| You're leaning on your butt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| I would like to ask that we see here that it's regular time and have an opportunity for response to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=317)|
| 0:05:26| if that would please you, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=326)|
| 0:05:33| I guess since this is a resolution and it doesn't have a second hearing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| I'm reluctant to not honor this gentleman's request for postponement since he can't be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=337)|
| 0:05:44| Well, I think it's the opportunity to hear his input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=344)|
| 0:05:46| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| Having served on the record commission for a period of time and being very familiar with their work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| I just know that a number of them are here this evening and would probably like to comment on that because.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=352)|
| 0:05:59| Ms. Teague is from the record commission as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=359)|
| 0:06:02| It's an ordinance, so there is a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| Oh, there is. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=365)|
| 0:06:06| There is, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=366)|
| 0:06:07| I stand corrected. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=367)|
| 0:06:08| Ms. Teague.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| Jean Teague, I'm the chairman of the record commission, of your record commission that was appointed by you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| And I think there are members here tonight from the record commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| I just got a copy of this tonight from a notification from Mr. McGovern that he wasn't going to be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=377)|
| 0:06:24| that he was going to be out of town and he wanted to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| Mr. McGovern was not at our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| As a matter of fact, we've been dealing with this for over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| And we've put it off and put it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=393)|
| 0:06:35| And back in February, we had the opportunity to agree on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| And it was postponed because we were waiting to see what the state legislature did regarding this particular issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=400)|
| 0:06:47| because it came to the forefront with something that happened in Gatlinburg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=407)|
| 0:06:51| Right now, we need to get something on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=411)|
| 0:06:55| For the simple reason we have people in here that are booting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=415)|
| 0:06:58| They're charging $95 to boot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=418)|
| 0:07:01| And I think that we need to get something on the books to not only help them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=421)|
| 0:07:05| but to help the citizens that we represent because they are coming in here and booting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=425)|
| 0:07:11| And sometimes, you know, we're not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| There are two companies right now that I know that are here, maybe three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=433)|
| 0:07:18| I know originally there was only one in Knoxville and then another one came in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| but there was one that came in from Murfreesboro.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| And this is one of the clients that Mr. McGovern is representing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=444)|
| 0:07:29| But he's had ample opportunity to make contact through the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=449)|
| 0:07:33| And through the summer, as a matter of fact, for almost a year, we've been meeting every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=453)|
| 0:07:38| So, you know, they've had ample opportunity to get back in touch with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| And he said he got a copy of the minutes on the 20th of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| And he is just today letting people know that he wants it postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=466)|
| 0:07:50| I have not heard anything from Mr. McGovern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=470)|
| 0:07:53| So I would encourage you to go ahead and let's listen to this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=473)|
| 0:07:56| I certainly respect the work of the Record Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=476)|
| 0:07:58| I stand corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=478)|
| 0:07:59| This is a two-reading ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=479)|
| 0:08:00| So I will withdraw my postponement if the second will withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=480)|
| 0:08:03| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=483)|
| 0:08:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=484)|
| 0:08:05| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=487)|
| 0:08:08| Just for folks to let you know, Item 12C, which deals with Articles 4 and 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| there's some, I guess, intricate procedural postponement measures coming up that will be more appropriate to take it up at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=494)|
| 0:08:20| So don't worry about it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=500)|
| 0:08:21| It's coming later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=501)|
| 0:08:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=502)|
| 0:08:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=503)|
| 0:08:24| Other items for postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| Marilyn, is that an old light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| There was somebody who was trying to speak when we were talking about the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| And just to be clear, we're going to pick it up later in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=513)|
| 0:08:36| So I think that will work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=516)|
| 0:08:38| But if that's okay with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=522)|
| 0:08:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=524)|
| 0:08:45| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| Consent items are 11K through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=526)|
| 0:08:51| Do we have an item to be added by motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=534)|

| 0:10:47| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| Okay, several quick things to add on Mayor's Report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| First of all, we'd love to welcome our guests from Boy Scout Troop 451 from Cumberland Baptist Church on Oak Ridge Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=651)|
| 0:10:58| They're completing their citizenship and the community merit badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| We'd love to ask you to stand and let us recognize you, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| Applause.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=664)|
| 0:11:13| Thank you all for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| Larry Hamlin is their Scoutmaster, and Larry, thank you for organizing the trip down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| We hope you benefit from your time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| We'd also like to recognize Terry Bobrowski and ask Terry to come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| And I owe Terry a big apology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=687)|
| 0:11:29| Terry was here last meeting to make this and patiently sat through the whole meeting waiting for the chair to recognize him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=689)|
| 0:11:38| and the chair failed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=698)|
| 0:11:40| So maybe you could get a sister badge for sitting through two council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| That's quite all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| I apologize, Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| My fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| It's an honor to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| And my purpose here, very simply, is to thank the city of Knoxville for their continued membership in our organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=709)|
| 0:11:57| the East Tennessee Development District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| I'm the executive director, and the city of Knoxville has been a charter member of our organization since 1966.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=719)|
| 0:12:07| And I don't get here often enough, but I did want to stop by and say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| Your participation in our organization is absolutely critical to the development work that we do throughout the region.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=731)|
| 0:12:19| We represent 16 counties and 56 cities in the Mideast Tennessee region, primarily in the areas of community and economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=739)|
| 0:12:28| We're very active in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| Our small business loan program is very active here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| We just recently funded a brand-new ice cream parlor down on Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| The event shot that's parked behind Volunteer Landing is one of our programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=758)|
| 0:12:43| I'd like to mention that your membership in our organization also makes the city eligible for grants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=763)|
| 0:12:49| through the Economic Development Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| Of course, that organization funded a large grant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| which was kind of the linchpin in getting the business, I-275 Business Park, off the ground back maybe four or five years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=775)|
| 0:13:05| We're involved in the Gerdau Omera Steel expansion with a grant through KUB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| And just recently, we got a grant to fund some Phase I brownfield assessments through the Environmental Protection Agency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=791)|
| 0:13:19| We're going to be able to use some of that money over on the south Knoxville development area as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=799)|
| 0:13:25| and hopefully about $14,000 worth of Phase I and Phase II assessments over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=805)|
| 0:13:31| that are going to be taken out of your development budget and funded through grants through our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=811)|
| 0:13:35| But your participation is absolutely critical to our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=815)|
| 0:13:42| What's good for Knoxville is good for the region, and what is good for the region is good for Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| So I'm simply here to say thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| I won't take up any more of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| I'd be happy to answer any questions you have about our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| But your membership certificate is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=833)|
| 0:13:56| I'd like to approach if I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| Please, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=838)|
| 0:13:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| And, Terry, while you're walking up here, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=840)|
| 0:14:02| The East Tennessee Development District does play a significant role in the city's development, and we very much appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=842)|
| 0:14:08| We have a lot of partners that help us do what we do, and some of them get more publicity than others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=848)|
| 0:14:15| and we definitely appreciate all your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=855)|
| 0:14:17| Thanks, Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=858)|
| 0:14:26| A couple of other real quick announcements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| The Tennessee Shines live radio broadcast from the Bishue Theater debuts tomorrow night at 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| This is going to be a live monthly broadcast, which I think is going to add a whole lot to our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=873)|
| 0:14:37| We're really excited about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| Tomorrow at 7 p.m., live radio from the Bishue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=879)|
| 0:14:43| It will be a great night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| And, finally, the 21st Annual 2008 Chrysler Jeep Boomsday Festival is this Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=885)|
| 0:14:50| Make sure you're clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=890)|
| 0:14:51| Sunday, August 31st, starts at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| It will go through 10 p.m. with the fireworks going off right when Star 102 FM starts at 9.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=894)|
| 0:15:01| It's the nation's largest Labor Day weekend fireworks show, and I hope you get a chance to enjoy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=901)|
| 0:15:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=906)|
| 0:15:07| Moving on to reports of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=907)|
| 0:15:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=913)|
| 0:15:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| Unfortunately, once again, we're in a sad situation where we've had a tragic shooting in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=916)|
| 0:15:24| Unfortunately, it occurred at a high school, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=924)|
| 0:15:30| The shooter apparently has had a troubled family situation, and a family support group didn't exist for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=930)|
| 0:15:42| and there's been a bad breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=942)|
| 0:15:46| So I don't know what really I can lend to this discussion other than certainly note that it is a shame, it's a tragedy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=946)|
| 0:15:58| and it won't bring back the individual who's deceased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=958)|
| 0:16:05| It's something that, unfortunately, is not readily solvable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| It's not easily solvable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| There's not something we can do to push a button to fix something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=970)|
| 0:16:20| It's just a part of, you know, you need to look out for others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| Look out for, you know, if you think there are issues, warning signs there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=985)|
| 0:16:31| You know, if you think it's appropriate, pull someone aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| Talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| They might want a friendly ear to listen to them and to confide in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=996)|
| 0:16:43| It's a shame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| Yes, a couple quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1010)|
| 0:16:54| Two announcements of public meetings coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1014)|
| 0:16:57| One, this Thursday there's going to be a meeting in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1017)|
| 0:17:00| The KCDC is hosting to sort of go over the progress on the redevelopment plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| It's going to be 5 o'clock this coming Thursday at Friendship Baptist Church on Texas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1025)|
| 0:17:13| I also just want to tell folks here, actually, on Labor Day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1033)|
| 0:17:15| there's a Labor Day picnic down at the amphitheater at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1035)|
| 0:17:21| I know a lot of labor folks will be there, and that's always a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| And just finally, just want to extend birthday wishes to Councilman Frost and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| Happy birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| I think in honor of your birthday, we won't sing to you, so that's quite a present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1056)|
| 0:17:38| Councilman Hawkless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1058)|
| 0:17:42| I mentioned this at the last council meeting in an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1062)|

| 0:28:00| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1680)|
| 0:28:01| I live on Gibbs Drive in Fountain City and many of you know this street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| It's over 100 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1687)|
| 0:28:09| It's tree-lined and shady and peaceful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| It's truly a neighborhood and it's truly a local treasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| The new Kroger planned for the lot across Broadway from us, previously occupied by the Target,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| promises to be a good thing for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1702)|
| 0:28:25| We're all really big Kroger fans, especially their extreme moose tracks ice cream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1705)|
| 0:28:31| but I won't go into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| However, we of the Gibbs Drive Neighborhood Association, and we're all here today if you could stand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| have several concerns which we have discussed with Mr. Paul Gianca,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| the real estate manager for the Kroger Corporation Southeast Division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| He's also here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1729)|
| 0:28:51| He has put forth several mutually beneficial suggestions concerning traffic flow, safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1731)|
| 0:28:58| and aesthetic issues that impact all of Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1738)|
| 0:29:02| He has assured us that over the next few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| he will be looking at these alternatives with his planning committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| and will then present them back to us before the September 18th business zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| We want to go on record with City Council expressing our concerns about the traffic, noise, and safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1754)|
| 0:29:21| and ask City Council to recognize our presence in doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1767)|
| 0:29:28| I see lights, but raise a hand if the light is a question for the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1768)|
| 0:29:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| I think you're okay for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| We'll call back if there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| I'm going to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1782)|
| 0:29:43| This is one of these, I guess, out of the ordinary circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1783)|
| 0:29:47| The proposed development is right across the other side of it from a different district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| The property where this is being discussed is in the fifth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| Gibbs Drive is in the fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| I've had extensive conversations and e-mails with folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| I was talking to Kenny Cloninger last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1802)|
| 0:30:05| It's important to protect residential streets such as this, particularly considering the nature of Gibbs Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1805)|
| 0:30:16| which has got to be one of the best streets in all of Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| My real concern, and I'll communicate that to Kroger's tonight because I wasn't sure who to contact with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1819)|
| 0:30:28| is the alignment of the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1828)|
| 0:30:31| You know, we don't need to allow something to come in, even though I know this is not on topic for tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1831)|
| 0:30:37| where it's aligned that would allow a straight shot into Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| I know when Target came in, talking to some people, when the Target came in umpteen years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1842)|
| 0:30:48| that that was part of the Target plan, and Target agreed to do that offset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1848)|
| 0:30:53| and that's been beneficial for Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| I mean, I don't mean to really make much of a joke of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1856)|
| 0:31:00| but we don't want to suddenly turn Gibbs Drive into a major collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1860)|
| 0:31:05| And, you know, we need to have something where the neighborhood is protected in terms of both traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1865)|
| 0:31:11| as well as adequately screening the dock there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1871)|
| 0:31:15| And I, you know, look forward to talking to Mr. Cloninger, the other folks who are involved in the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| and Kroger's, and be willing to put something together with City Engineering Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1880)|
| 0:31:25| and whoever else to figure out what we need to do to allow this development to go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| and likewise protect Gibbs Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| Mr. Huggless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1893)|
| 0:31:35| Mine was just a, you asked about other neighborhood concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| Mine was just a procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1898)|
| 0:31:40| Are there other people from Gibbs Drive or the neighborhood that would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1900)|
| 0:31:44| So I just want to make sure they get a chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| I don't know if anybody else wants to, but I want to make sure they get a chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| Everybody okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| You would?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1914)|
| 0:31:55| Oh, you're okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1919)|
| 0:32:00| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Well, I'll just really echo what has already been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1921)|
| 0:32:05| and I understand the concerns of this very historic neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| And I appreciate the e-mails and the opportunity to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1930)|
| 0:32:15| I've heard from George, Scott, and Mary Lighting, and then the Cloningers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| And so I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| And I appreciate them being willing to come down tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| because even though they were aware that we were not in a position to take any action on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1945)|
| 0:32:32| I felt it was tremendously important for those folks with Kroger's to understand your interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1952)|
| 0:32:39| and the interest of this council in finding the best solution for Kroger to be very successful there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1959)|
| 0:32:46| as well as for the neighborhood to continue to be protected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| So I want to thank you all for coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| and showing us your interest and your concern in your neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1972)|
| 0:32:59| Mr. Becker, we'll be right with you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| Just briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| I guess just two things, just to remind everybody so we all understand the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1982)|
| 0:33:06| that the road realignment is a BZA variance that will be up on September 18th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1986)|
| 0:33:12| And clearly, if things aren't worked out there, that's an appealable decision to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| So it's especially important for folks to be here, because this could land back in our lap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| I'm optimistic it is, and I'm pleased at how quickly Kroger's has responded on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| responded to a lot of other concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2007)|
| 0:33:29| And frankly, I'm really pleased at how united the neighborhood is and how strong the turnout there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2009)|
| 0:33:34| That says a lot of good things about working something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2014)|
| 0:33:38| If you could give us your name and title and address, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| Paul Gianca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| I'm a real estate manager for Kroger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| I live in Marietta, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| I first became aware of the Gibbs Drive concern yesterday at 1 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2025)|
| 0:33:50| Spoke with Carol and Mike from the historical Gibbs Drive area, and we convened today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2030)|
| 0:33:57| It's 5 o'clock to review the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| I explained to them what we were looking to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2040)|
| 0:34:03| Their big concerns were they don't want people cutting through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2043)|
| 0:34:06| I see their point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| I've now got my traffic engineer working on some possible solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| So my promise to them was we would review multiple options, come back to them within about 10 to 14 days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2051)|
| 0:34:18| and then handle it before the BZA process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2058)|
| 0:34:20| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2060)|
| 0:34:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2061)|
| 0:34:22| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2063)|
| 0:34:24| We appreciate your attentiveness to that, and thank you, neighborhood, for showing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| Mr. Becker said it well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| So, excuse me, Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2072)|
| 0:34:38| I just want to point out also that I believe this is a PC-1 zoning, and that would be a plan commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2078)|
| 0:34:43| So if I'm not mistaken, this has to go through a use-on-review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2083)|
| 0:34:49| So that's really critical because that's when the concept plan, design plan has to be reviewed again by the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2089)|
| 0:34:57| Unlike zoning, that does not automatically go to this body for ratification or approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2097)|
| 0:35:03| Zoning is a legislative act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2103)|
| 0:35:06| The use-on-review process is internal to the MPC and their commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2106)|
| 0:35:10| but for those that don't know, any action such as that can be appealed to this body, any use-on-review action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2110)|
| 0:35:18| And so I would encourage the folks from Gibbs Drive to engage very carefully and thoroughly in that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2118)|
| 0:35:26| be at the MPC meeting if you can, et cetera, work with the applicant, Kroger, and the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| make sure that your issues and your concerns are addressed, and, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| understanding that not only do you have the recourse of appealing a BZA decision here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| but you have the recourse of appealing any MPC use-on-review decision also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2142)|
| 0:35:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2149)|
| 0:35:50| Yeah, I guess just to follow up on Councilman Holquist's piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2150)|
| 0:35:53| my understanding, Mr. Donaldson, is that the development plan has been approved a while back by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2153)|
| 0:35:59| and I have just a follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| If the development plan, if the driveway is changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| is it easy to revise the development plan that's already adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2166)|
| 0:36:09| or does that create a little extra wrinkle in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2169)|
| 0:36:16| A couple questions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| The development plan was approved by the Planning Commission at its August 14th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2178)|
| 0:36:25| If there is an effort to appeal that, the 15-day window expires on Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2185)|
| 0:36:34| But the effort to relocate a driveway could qualify as a minor amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2194)|
| 0:36:41| and be subject to staff approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| I'll have to take a look at the exact language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2208)|
| 0:36:49| I stand corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2209)|
| 0:36:50| Councilman Becker, I appreciate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| I wasn't aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| I feel like it puts me in a very awkward position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| When MPC will approve a development plan for a zoning that doesn't even exist yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| I have a real problem with that procedurally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2224)|
| 0:37:07| But apparently the MPC does what it chooses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| I don't necessarily think that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| So I feel a little foolish in having suggested that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2234)|
| 0:37:16| not knowing that they acted in spite of not having the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| Yeah, just in response, to be clear, there's a BZA hearing specifically on the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| So there is at least as good a process for dealing with the issue of concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| that the horse is not out of the barn yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| So that's the way to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| Yeah, there were 14 conditions attached to the approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| one of which is subject to city council approval of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| and also subject to the proposed variances being approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2270)|
| 0:37:51| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| Mr. Foster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| Quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2273)|
| 0:37:54| Mr. Swanson, following up on what Mr. Donaldson says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| based on what MPC did at their August meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| if, for hopefully some unlikely reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| Kroger decides they do not want to change the entrance to it out of an abundance of caution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2285)|
| 0:38:14| should the neighborhood consider appealing just to leave that avenue open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2294)|
| 0:38:21| I'm not comfortable with giving the neighborhood legal advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2301)|
| 0:38:23| but I think they probably would want to consult their own council on that pretty quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2303)|
| 0:38:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2310)|
| 0:38:31| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2311)|
| 0:38:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2314)|
| 0:38:36| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2316)|
| 0:38:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2319)|
| 0:38:42| Before this next item, I want to recognize Mr. Swanson to help us clarify something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2322)|
| 0:38:47| Yeah, I'm going to have to admit that I've made an error tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| When Ms. Pelo made the motion earlier with regard to the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2332)|
| 0:38:56| the motion to withdraw on items 10A and 11J,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| which was the appeal of the home occupation on the southwest side of Colony Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2340)|
| 0:39:09| when she made that motion, I think everybody understood that what was intended there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2349)|
| 0:39:13| was that there was not going to be a home occupation there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| and that the person who was seeking to operate the home occupation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2356)|
| 0:39:22| who won at the lower level, would not actually have that home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| But the actual literal effect of the motion, which was a motion to withdraw,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| is to withdraw the appeal in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| And if you withdraw the appeal, then you are just left with the action from the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2377)|
| 0:39:42| which was to approve the home occupation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| And so I don't think that's where council intended to be with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2385)|
| 0:39:49| and I think it's a situation that can be corrected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| but I think because I was distracted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| and wasn't paying attention to what was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| you did something that you really didn't want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| If, in fact, that is the case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| then my recommendation to you is that someone who is on the prevailing side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2400)|
| 0:40:05| which is everybody, make a motion to reconsider this matter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2405)|
| 0:40:10| and place it back on the agenda and then move to postpone it for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| because everybody who is interested in it has now left,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| but put it back on the agenda for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| and we can accomplish what was intended to be accomplished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| assuming that everyone is still in agreement with regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| So I apologize for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| And if someone wants to make that motion, now would be a great time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| Oh, Mr. Blutner is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| Mr. Blutner is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2434)|
| 0:40:36| We couldn't find you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2436)|
| 0:40:38| Would someone like to make a motion to reconsider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| I would like to move to reconsider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2443)|
| 0:40:44| Discussion on reconsidering only is all we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2444)|
| 0:40:47| I would be reconsidering both item 10A and 11J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| All those in favor of reconsidering, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2453)|

| 0:40:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2457)|
| 0:40:58| It's back on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| I still have my light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2462)|
| 0:41:03| I was going to see if we were going to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| Go ahead, Ms. Phelan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2465)|
| 0:41:06| I would make a motion to postpone item 10A and 11J for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| The motion is to postpone 10A and 11J for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2475)|
| 0:41:16| Any discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| Ready to vote, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2480)|

| 0:41:29| I believe it might be in my court instead of yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| But thank you, Mr. Swanson, for straightening it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| 11A is a resolution authorizing the mayor to enter into a memorandum of understanding with Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2495)|

| 0:42:04| with respect to a low and moderate income housing facility to be constructed in Knoxville, Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2524)|

| 0:42:24| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| Is somebody here to address this issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2546)|

| 0:42:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| I'm David Arning, 521 English Village Way, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2551)|
| 0:42:37| Mayor, members of council, good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| I'm with Southeastern Housing Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2561)|
| 0:42:43| and I'm here tonight on behalf of Volunteer Ministry Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2563)|
| 0:42:47| who will be the owner and operator of Menvilla Manor, also known as Fifth Avenue Motel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2567)|
| 0:42:53| or the former Fifth Avenue Motel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| It is to be 57 units of permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2576)|
| 0:43:00| I've had the opportunity in recent years to meet and work with some of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| but I've not been before council as a body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| and nor have I been here representing the Menvilla development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| So for that reason, I'd like to take just a minute to introduce myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2590)|
| 0:43:13| and also Southeastern Housing Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2593)|
| 0:43:15| and how we became involved in the historic redevelopment of Menvilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| I'm a native of Knoxville, a graduate of Bearden High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| After I graduated from the Naval Academy, I served five years on active duty in the Navy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2604)|
| 0:43:30| working as a supply officer managing financial and logistic matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2610)|
| 0:43:35| I got a master's from the University of Georgia in 2004 in historic preservation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| and subsequently managed a real estate consulting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| and historic redevelopment firm in Greenville, South Carolina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2623)|
| 0:43:47| In 2006, I returned to Knoxville and joined Hallrob Investments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2627)|
| 0:43:50| to work as a developer focusing on urban revitalization and adaptive use projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2630)|
| 0:43:56| So when John Lawler, the director of the 10-year plan to end chronic homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| approached Southeastern Housing Foundation about being their strategic partner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| for implementing the 10-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| more specifically to develop approximately 500 units of permanent supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| over the next eight years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2653)|
| 0:44:15| it was certainly a tremendous opportunity for me personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2655)|
| 0:44:18| and also for Southeastern Housing Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2658)|
| 0:44:21| We, Southeastern Housing Foundation that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2661)|
| 0:44:24| is an initiative of Knoxville Leadership Foundation, which is also a local nonprofit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| Their mission is to connect communities of resource with communities of need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| and so Southeastern fits nicely into their mission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| Southeastern has access to a capable staff of grant writers, administrative support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| and affordable housing specialists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| We work in close concert with Mr. Lawler and his office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| We also have the benefit of counsel from our development advisor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2688)|
| 0:44:52| which is Lawler Woods Affordable Housing Group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| So in short, I think we have an experience and a committed development team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| that's working diligently to make Menvilla Manor a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2699)|
| 0:45:03| As you may already know, the lowest of four competitive bids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2703)|
| 0:45:06| recently came back for the work on Menvilla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2706)|
| 0:45:09| and it was a good $1.5 million over what was initially anticipated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2709)|
| 0:45:14| The developer at the time, who had a number of other projects underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2714)|
| 0:45:17| recognized that this funding gap was going to require the full attention of someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2717)|
| 0:45:22| and so in the best interest of the project and the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| that developer decided to step aside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2725)|
| 0:45:27| and Southeastern Housing Foundation, with its unique mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| and relationship with the 10-year plan, was a natural position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2730)|
| 0:45:34| or a natural fit, rather, to step in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| I do realize that Menvilla has been before counsel on other occasions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| and also that unfortunately the project has not moved along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| quite as efficiently or as quickly as anyone had hoped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| There are a number of factors that have contributed to the delays,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2749)|
| 0:45:52| most notably administrative hurdles related to the historic tax credit application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2752)|
| 0:45:58| coordination of the various funding sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| and also the aforementioned increase in construction costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| The rehab costs are in line with other similar projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| that we've seen for supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| but they are significantly higher than new construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| primarily due to the deteriorated condition of the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| and also the special unique, or unique rather,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| living and programming needs associated with the tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| and lastly some certain historic requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| that are associated with the historic tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2787)|
| 0:46:34| I would also add that the project incurs some extra transaction costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| related to the tax credit work that otherwise would not be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2798)|
| 0:46:43| in just a typical market rate project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| but those expenses are more than offset by the private equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2806)|
| 0:46:49| that the tax credits generate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2809)|
| 0:46:52| I can't overemphasize the complexity of this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2812)|
| 0:46:54| Affordable housing and historic tax credit projects in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| that involve this type of equity are complex to begin with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| and with the capital markets such as they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2821)|
| 0:47:04| there probably hasn't been a more difficult time to develop a project like Menvilla,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2824)|
| 0:47:09| at least in recent memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2829)|
| 0:47:12| We can't control all those factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| but I can assure you that Southeastern Housing Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| and the entire Menvilla development team are focused 100 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| on securing the funding and closing this transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| Each funding source is dependent on one another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| and that's why we're here tonight requesting the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2847)|
| 0:47:31| Based on a post-rehabilitated appraised value of $2.3 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2851)|
| 0:47:35| Menvilla would be expected to pay in annual taxes approximately $25,000 for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2855)|
| 0:47:41| and $24,000 in county taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| The exhibits in our application, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| indicate the impact that the property taxes would have on the operations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2867)|
| 0:47:52| and simply put,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| Menvilla cannot support that type of expense over any length of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2875)|
| 0:48:00| Moreover, but for the pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2880)|
| 0:48:02| development of Menvilla cannot be financed as planned using permanent debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| VMC has committed to closing the funding gap through privately financed permanent debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2886)|
| 0:48:13| As you know, the project's ability to support that debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2893)|
| 0:48:16| is driven by the net operating income of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| and that, of course, is affected by the operating expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| And if we are able to reduce the operating expenses through this pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2903)|
| 0:48:27| it has tremendous leverage for VMC to be able to take out a loan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2907)|
| 0:48:33| and close that funding gap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| In short, it amounts to about $500,000 worth of additional capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2915)|
| 0:48:39| that can be put into the project to develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2919)|
| 0:48:42| We strongly believe that Menvilla Manor is a project deserving of the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| Permanent supportive housing in the Housing First model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| is an effective approach to addressing chronic homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| and also for saving local tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| It will provide a quality, affordable housing to accountable individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| who have committed themselves to improving their lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| and also to getting off the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2942)|
| 0:49:04| And that may be the most important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2944)|
| 0:49:06| It will take people off of the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| Lastly, the Menvilla project represents a $6 million investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| that we believe will have a very positive impact on the Fifth Avenue-Broadway area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2953)|
| 0:49:18| We thank you very much for your consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| and I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2960)|
| 0:49:23| Ms. Ronnie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2963)|
| 0:49:24| Thank you, Mr. Arning, for coming this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| I have a couple of questions about this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| In looking at your budget, who pays the rent on the apartments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2969)|
| 0:49:35| I notice there's an amount for the efficiency apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| and for the one-bedroom apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2979)|
| 0:49:41| And assuming that the folks that we're trying to get into permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| at least when they first move in, are not yet employed, how does that cash flow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| Well, the payment will actually be made by the tenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2989)|
| 0:49:52| primarily through a Section 8 voucher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2992)|
| 0:49:54| which is issued through KCDC, the local public housing authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| So the individual signs their own lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=2998)|
| 0:50:02| and it's long-term permanent in the sense that it's long-term, like a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| It's not transitional or emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| But to answer your question, the tenant themselves pays for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| They're required to pay $25 of that themselves, generating that themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3014)|
| 0:50:19| And we anticipate that some of the tenants are going to have disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| and Social Security benefits as well that might support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| But the numbers that you see in the exhibit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| those rent amounts are fair market rents for 2009 that HUD publishes annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3030)|
| 0:50:36| And those are the projected rents for 2009 that should be adopted in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3036)|
| 0:50:40| And so you anticipate that all of these individuals will be eligible for Section 8 or disability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3046)|
| 0:50:47| Is that federal assistance to pay that rent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3047)|
| 0:50:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| The homeless population does have priority here in Knoxville for vouchers, for tenant-based vouchers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3050)|
| 0:50:56| And do you anticipate that Menvilla will be coming back to the city in any capacity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| for further support for this project outside of the pilot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3061)|
| 0:51:05| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3065)|
| 0:51:06| I think Mr. Lawler might have had an opportunity to talk with most of you about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| But we have been working with the Community Development Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3069)|
| 0:51:13| to try to identify some surplus funds that could be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| CDBG, home, house funds, that could be applied to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| In what amount and for how long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| Those would be essentially grants, so not for a recurring period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3085)|
| 0:51:30| They would be for development and not operations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3090)|
| 0:51:36| So capital to get it off the ground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| I can answer that more specifically if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3100)|
| 0:51:43| The annual plan that was approved this year, there was $250,000 of home money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3103)|
| 0:51:49| home funds for Housing First projects that would be allocated to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3109)|
| 0:51:55| In addition, we have $100,000 in rental rehab, that's CDBG funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3115)|
| 0:52:00| and $100,000 in house program income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3120)|
| 0:52:04| So we anticipate coming in about a month to seek your approval for a development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3124)|
| 0:52:11| that would allocate those funds to the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3131)|
| 0:52:13| In addition, Knox County Community Development will have on their September agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3133)|
| 0:52:20| we are told, a grant of $250,000 in CDBG funds that would be a grant to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3140)|
| 0:52:30| Then we would turn around and grant that along with our other funds for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3150)|
| 0:52:36| And that is simply done to simplify the process of monitoring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3156)|
| 0:52:43| so they don't have to monitor the Davis-Bacon and other federal requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| at the same time that we have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| So in order to simplify that process, we have agreed to monitor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3169)|
| 0:52:56| to accept those funds for this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| and to monitor it along with the other ones that we will be asking for your approval for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3179)|
| 0:53:04| And Mr. Arning and Ms. Rojera, you anticipate that the $350,000 through community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3184)|
| 0:53:09| is a capital investment that would be one year only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3189)|
| 0:53:12| You don't anticipate that being a recurring thing once this gets off the ground?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3192)|
| 0:53:16| Exactly. It's just a one year. It's for the construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| It's actually $450,000, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| The $250,000 in home, $100,000 in CDBG, and $100,000 in house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| That would be another $450,000 of ours, plus then the $250,000 from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| Right, and that would be one time this year's commitment, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3213)|
| 0:53:37| Ms. Arning, given all this investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| and the fact that the pilot that we're looking at is over a period of 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| it's obviously hard to project where our community will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3223)|
| 0:53:46| regarding addressing homelessness, say, at year 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| If at some point this building is no longer needed to be utilized for this type of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| does the pilot go with the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3234)|
| 0:53:56| and could some other developer or owner benefit from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| or does it only go with this particular project and this particular use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| I think the short answer to that is the IDB could draft that with whatever language they like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| to see that it did not transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3248)|
| 0:54:11| From our perspective, there's a 15-year requirement that the property be income limited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3251)|
| 0:54:17| and serve a rent-restricted population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| So there are certain partnership agreements that will go along with the equity investors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3261)|
| 0:54:28| that will prevent BMC and Menville & Manor from disposing of that property prior to 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3268)|
| 0:54:35| And if it were to sell it at 15 years or beyond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3275)|
| 0:54:39| I think that would be up to the council and the IDB in terms of whether or not that could transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| So if within the 15-year term we find that we no longer need these units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| for permanent supportive housing for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| then they would revert to Section 8, rent-subsidized housing units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3291)|
| 0:54:55| Not necessarily Section 8, but they would be affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| as defined by the low-income housing tax credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3299)|
| 0:55:01| which I think is at least 10 percent of your population is below 50 percent AMI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3301)|
| 0:55:08| The restriction that you talked about for the full 20-year term that this pilot is only applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3308)|
| 0:55:14| to this arrangement with permanent supportive housing and BMC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3314)|
| 0:55:18| and you said the IDB could write that in, that's not in the language of our resolution tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| When do you anticipate that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3323)|
| 0:55:25| I mean, I'd be much more comfortable if I knew that I was obligating these foregone tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3325)|
| 0:55:33| to this specific project than it could never be rolled with the building to another use in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3333)|
| 0:55:39| that we can't predict but might not be appropriate for this kind of treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| Well, I'm not entirely sure how to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| I think we had anticipated working out those details with IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3347)|
| 0:55:52| Having said that, I will say that I do think it's unlikely, and that's not to imply a guarantee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3352)|
| 0:55:59| but I do think it's very unlikely that within 20 years the property would change hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| just again based on some of the requirements associated with the tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3364)|
| 0:56:09| After 15 years, you can get rid of the property, you can't sell it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| but you essentially have to jump through various hoops and satisfy certain criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| So I know that's not a definitive answer that you're looking for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3378)|
| 0:56:22| but the strong likelihood is that it will remain serving this purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3382)|
| 0:56:28| or an affordable housing purpose for as many as 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| Okay. I'd like to defer to my other council members, but I guess I'm only comfortable with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3392)|
| 0:56:36| if I understand that this pilot is specifically linked to the permanent supportive housing goal that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3396)|
| 0:56:43| which I understand we're all on the same page with right now, but 20 years is a long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| And I just want to know that this building isn't going to fall into other ownership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3407)|
| 0:56:52| where the city taxpayers are not benefiting from the tax revenue on this particular property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3412)|
| 0:56:58| and it's put to a different use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3418)|
| 0:57:03| And before I go, David, is there any way I understand Ms. Ruddy's question, I know you do too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3423)|
| 0:57:07| is there any way we can, you know, confidently answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3427)|
| 0:57:16| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3436)|
| 0:57:18| Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3438)|
| 0:57:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3439)|
| 0:57:20| Dr. Lyons might have an answer for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3440)|
| 0:57:22| Well, I think we're just going to refer over to Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3442)|
| 0:57:24| Yeah, we write conditions that we have in previous pilots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| The IDB can be instructed in the resolution to put what answers Ms. Ruddy's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3447)|
| 0:57:33| We can just add an amendment to that resolution if you would like to amend the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| And they suggest to me that that won't be harmful to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| If it's amenable to the council, I'd like to go ahead and offer that amendment at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3462)|
| 0:57:47| And I guess I'll leave it up to Mr. Swanson to propose the appropriate language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3467)|
| 0:57:52| But some kind of limitation in this resolution that this 20-year pilot is only an obligation as long as this building is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3472)|
| 0:58:00| and I don't know what we want, under the ownership of VMC or for the use of permanent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3480)|
| 0:58:05| I guess I'm most comfortable as long as it's under the use for permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3485)|
| 0:58:10| I think that's what makes the most sense, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3490)|
| 0:58:13| So I would move that this pilot be restricted to this particular property as long as it is used for permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3493)|
| 0:58:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| Right now we're just discussing the amendment, the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| Are there any questions or comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3509)|
| 0:58:32| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3512)|
| 0:58:33| I guess just a question for Mr. Lawler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3513)|
| 0:58:35| Any challenges you see with that language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3515)|
| 0:58:44| I think what you want to do is direct the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| First of all, John Lawler, I'm Director of the 10-Year Plan to End Chronic Homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| And, David, thank you for your work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3530)|
| 0:58:52| It's been great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| I think what you want to do is direct the resolution such that as long as the property complies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3533)|
| 0:58:59| with the low-income housing tax credit obligations that are spoken of in the partnership agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3539)|
| 0:59:06| then the pilot would still remain in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| Once it moves away from the things obligated in that development agreement, then the pilot would be removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3550)|
| 0:59:18| But as long as you have to operate in conjunction with the criteria associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3558)|
| 0:59:25| with the low-income housing tax credit thresholds, you are serving a low-income population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3565)|
| 0:59:31| And I think the only way a property like this can succeed is with a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3571)|
| 0:59:35| Once it moves away from that, then I would recommend that you would have the authority to remove the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3575)|
| 0:59:43| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| Yeah, I guess what I heard is we want it to be supportive housing for the homeless, which I actually agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3584)|
| 0:59:51| And I guess my question is the language, you're broadening a little into low-income housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3591)|
| 0:59:57| Is there a way to say it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3597)|
| 1:00:00| And I guess my worry is do we see a possibility of the 10-year plan 20 years from now saying we don't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3600)|
| 1:00:08| permanent supportive housing, we need a way to craft it to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3608)|
| 1:00:14| within the use of the efforts to end homelessness, does that feel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3614)|
| 1:00:20| My concern with broadening this, Mr. Becker, and I also would like to defer to Mr. Woodhull's work with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3620)|
| 1:00:26| Fifth and Broadway Task Force, but I think, you know, a lot of the discussion within neighborhood about the use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3626)|
| 1:00:32| of this building related to this being permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3632)|
| 1:00:36| And low-income housing or Section 8 supported housing doesn't necessarily have that supportive component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3636)|
| 1:00:44| And in respect for the neighborhood that helped to craft, I think, consensus around the importance of this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3644)|
| 1:00:53| and the 10-year plan, I want to make sure that what we're obligating these tax dollars for is very narrowly focused to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3653)|
| 1:01:00| what everyone has agreed on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| And low-income rent supportive housing, in my mind, can be a different animal than permanent supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3662)|
| 1:01:11| So that's why I used the language permanent supportive housing in my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3671)|
| 1:01:16| I'm going to go to Mr. Frost next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| I'm not on this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3678)|
| 1:01:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3680)|
| 1:01:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| Then, Mr. Hulkless, this is on the motion to amend right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3682)|
| 1:01:27| I think I better hold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3687)|
| 1:01:28| I'm not sure if what I have is appropriate to the amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| I think, Ms. Roddy, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| That's the language we should use because that is what we've agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| So, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3701)|
| 1:01:42| Ready to vote on the motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| Everybody ready on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3706)|
| 1:01:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3711)|
| 1:01:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3712)|
| 1:01:53| Now back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3715)|
| 1:01:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3716)|
| 1:01:57| Let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| In talking about your history in Knoxville, you forgot about your good father and brother, the attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3718)|
| 1:02:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3725)|
| 1:02:06| This is to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3726)|
| 1:02:07| The pilot is to apply while the permanent financing is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| Correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3732)|
| 1:02:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3733)|
| 1:02:14| Could you repeat that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| To supply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| The pilot is to apply while the permanent financing is in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| It's necessary on our cash flow statement for VMC to be able to go and apply for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3740)|
| 1:02:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3746)|
| 1:02:27| How long are the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3747)|
| 1:02:28| What's the term of the notes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| For VMC, potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| Well, for Menville and Manor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| That's the true owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| I'm not sure if I know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| I might be confused by your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| Menville and Manor LP is the owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3761)|
| 1:02:45| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3765)|
| 1:02:46| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3766)|
| 1:02:47| Who's executing the notes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| VMC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3769)|
| 1:02:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3770)|
| 1:02:51| They are the owner of the general partner of Menville and Manor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| How long are those loans going to be for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3774)|
| 1:02:57| How many years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| The term, I believe that we anticipate is 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3778)|
| 1:03:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3781)|
| 1:03:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| So when the notes are paid off, the pilot ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3783)|
| 1:03:10| It would with a 20-year term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3792)|
| 1:03:13| What happens if the loans are refinanced and put out for more than 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3793)|
| 1:03:20| Well, I think at that point VMC would just be subject to trying to negotiate the best terms that they could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3800)|
| 1:03:26| based on the operations of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| I don't think at that point the city would have any obligation to support or to revisit the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3809)|
| 1:03:36| Let me ask Mrs. Poplin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3816)|
| 1:03:38| The pilot is statutorily limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| Just making sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3823)|
| 1:03:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3824)|
| 1:03:45| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3825)|
| 1:03:46| Mr. Arning, you said that part of the financing packages are historic tax credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3826)|
| 1:03:52| and part, which would be syndicated, I assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3832)|
| 1:03:55| and part are the low-income housing tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3835)|
| 1:03:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| Did you apply for those under the 2008 cycle for the low-income credits through THDA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3840)|
| 1:04:06| These are what's known as 4% low-income housing tax credits or as-of-right tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3846)|
| 1:04:12| And essentially if you finance half the project with tax-exempt bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| which are basically used as a construction loan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| you as-of-right are entitled to the 4% low-income housing tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| So it's not part of the competitive program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3863)|
| 1:04:25| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3865)|
| 1:04:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| Let me just, for clarification, the language that was amended that read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| for so long as a property is utilized for permanent supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| that's the language that's before us as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3877)|
| 1:04:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3881)|
| 1:04:42| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3882)|
| 1:04:43| Are you ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3885)|
| 1:04:46| Seeing no lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3886)|
| 1:04:47| All those in favor of the motion as amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3887)|
| 1:04:49| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3891)|
| 1:04:52| David, thank you for explaining a fairly complicated situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3895)|

| 1:05:21| Mr. Whitehall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3921)|
| 1:05:23| Transit is getting a lot of attention these days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| and I would appreciate if, Melissa, if you could come up with CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3926)|
| 1:05:34| More people are riding CAT, and it's costing us more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| If you could explain how this enhancement is going to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| Yes, thank you, Mayor and Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| This fare box project has been in the works for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3945)|
| 1:05:51| and the timing is really pretty fortuitous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3951)|
| 1:05:55| We are seeing more people riding, more fares going into the fare boxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| and we see an opportunity to make use of some new technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| to allow us to enhance our revenue stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| and be able to make transit even more available and attractive to people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3968)|
| 1:06:15| And also, how is this being funded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3975)|
| 1:06:18| This is being funded from three capital grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3978)|
| 1:06:21| which have been put together over the last three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3981)|
| 1:06:24| All three came before Council with this project in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3984)|
| 1:06:28| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=3988)|

| 1:09:00| of this nationally acclaimed program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| As you are aware, in June, university administrators proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4143)|
| 1:09:07| eliminating the entire department and all of its clinical services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4147)|
| 1:09:11| Since then, the community has expressed its outrage at this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| Last week, we learned that some progress has finally been made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4156)|
| 1:09:21| and we are cautiously optimistic that a satisfactory resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4161)|
| 1:09:26| to this issue may be achieved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| However, we are very concerned that any proposed solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4168)|
| 1:09:33| must not diminish our academic and clinical programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| We simply have not received any assurances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4177)|
| 1:09:41| that these programs will continue in their present forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| I would like to thank the Knoxville City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| for its consideration of this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| Your approval of this resolution would send a strong message| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4191)|
| 1:09:55| to the university administration and the Board of Trustees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4195)|
| 1:09:59| on behalf of all of the citizens of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4199)|
| 1:10:02| that this entire department must be maintained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| and adequately funded for the benefit of all East Tennesseans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4206)|

| 1:11:36| that are on that commission in case that you have forgotten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| Representing the city here is Allison Ebertein| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| who is from the Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4302)|

| 1:12:08| but Mark is also on there as a Private Citizen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4328)|
| 1:12:11| and I'm on there as a Private Citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4331)|
| 1:12:13| At this time, I will turn this over to Allison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| to tell you what the difference was from when Mr. McGovern was there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4336)|
| 1:12:21| and what you have before you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4345)|
| 1:12:26| We came before Council, I believe in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4346)|
| 1:12:29| and brought you a booting ordinance that looks very different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| than what you see tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4351)|
| 1:12:33| At that last meeting, the Council reviewed that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4353)|
| 1:12:36| You all had several questions, some of which regarded signs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4356)|
| 1:12:39| some of which regarded notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| And so what we did is we took your live meeting back to the Record Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| and played it for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| And we, at that point in time, addressed all of the issues that you all had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4366)|
| 1:12:51| At this point, we believe that this ordinance is a broader ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| It requires registration of the companies that are booting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| And we addressed your sign issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4379)|
| 1:13:01| Officer Husky is here with a sample sign, which we'd like to show to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4381)|
| 1:13:10| The Record Commission listened to your comments with regard to lettering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| and the sizes, and Councilman Becker was actually at the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4394)|
| 1:13:18| And so this is the sign that this is what a sign would look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4398)|
| 1:13:21| based on what's written in the drafted ordinance at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4401)|
| 1:13:25| And so in addition to the sign changes, we've also set a price of $75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4405)|
| 1:13:33| That was something that was also addressed at the last Council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4413)|
| 1:13:37| Mr. McGovern, the letter that you have tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| Mr. McGovern was at not this last meeting but the meeting prior to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4419)|
| 1:13:43| and made several suggestion changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| We actually took all of those changes with one exception, and that was the price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| I think they asked for $80 or $90, and we set it at $75.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4431)|
| 1:13:57| So we would like for you all to pass this if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4437)|
| 1:14:02| And then if you want to address Mr. McGovern's comments at second reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4442)|
| 1:14:05| that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4448)|
| 1:14:09| Two quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4449)|
| 1:14:11| Officer Husky, could you take the sign and stand in the back of the room as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4451)|
| 1:14:15| You walk forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4455)|
| 1:14:17| Mr. Swanson said even those of us over 50 can read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4457)|
| 1:14:20| Yes, that works well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| Without my glasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4462)|
| 1:14:23| Oh, I can barely see him without my glasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4463)|
| 1:14:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4469)|
| 1:14:30| I originally had it at 18 by 24-inch with two-inch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| These are two-inch letters, and these are one-inch letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4473)|
| 1:14:36| I had the sign shop draft this up, and it would not go on an 18 by 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4476)|
| 1:14:40| So this is the size they could put it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4480)|
| 1:14:42| It's 24 by 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| And, Ms. Ebertina, I have a quick question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4486)|
| 1:14:49| I didn't realize this the other day when I was talking to Ms. Poplin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4489)|
| 1:14:54| The definition of a private parking lot, just to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4494)|
| 1:14:57| I had some complaints the other day about folks towing an apartment parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4497)|
| 1:15:02| This would cover apartment parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| It would cover commercial parking lots, not just parking lots for parking lot's sake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| I mean, this is all parking lots, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| That's correct, with the exception of parking lots that are smaller than six spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4518)|
| 1:15:19| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4519)|
| 1:15:21| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| I've read Mr. McGovern's letter, and at least this is on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4524)|
| 1:15:29| I certainly respect the time and efforts that the record commission put in on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4529)|
| 1:15:35| I'm real curious to see what he says happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4535)|
| 1:15:38| I mean, I don't think it's a big surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| I'm not a big fan of towing companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| I remember in the prior administration, Mr. McGovern came here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4543)|
| 1:15:47| and he admitted he left with a bloody nose when I got through with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4547)|
| 1:15:51| But nevertheless, you know, you've got to be fair to folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| So I'm hoping to find out in the next two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| because I assume this will pass on first reading, you know, what's happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4556)|
| 1:16:01| And I assume that you'll be back, Mrs. Ebertein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| I did speak to Mr. McGovern earlier this week about a couple of his concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| One of the discussions at the record commission is that they wanted the booting rate tied to the towing rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4570)|
| 1:16:16| And I think he anticipated that the language in the ordinance would actually say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| the booting rate is going to be pursuant to section and then refer to the tow rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4581)|
| 1:16:27| That's very difficult for enforcement, for police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4587)|
| 1:16:30| Plus, it would be difficult to put that on the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4590)|
| 1:16:32| We thought it was better, and based on the record minutes, to put an actual price in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4592)|
| 1:16:37| That's not to say that if the tow rate goes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4597)|
| 1:16:40| I fully anticipate the booting companies to want to come back in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| we want our rate to go up as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| So that was one of his concerns, that the ordinance didn't say specifically tie it to the tow rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4605)|
| 1:16:51| because there was some discussion at the record commission about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| His other concern was the size of the sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4614)|
| 1:16:56| At the last meeting he attended, it was an 18 by 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4616)|
| 1:16:59| We didn't realize that the shop couldn't make that sign with this size lettering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| So at the last record commission, when we brought the sign in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| we asked the record commission to change the ordinance to that size sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| My understanding is his client thinks that's a price issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| Standardized signs, this is not a standardized sign, so it would cost them more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| So that's one of their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| This is just a minimum size sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| I think that's something to consider at second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| Thanks, Allison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4648)|
| 1:17:29| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4649)|
| 1:17:32| Okay, ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4652)|

| 1:17:40| 12B is an ordinance to amend Section 2-455 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| to adjust the City of Knoxville's hourly events payroll rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4665)|
| 1:17:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4670)|
| 1:17:51| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4671)|
| 1:17:53| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4673)|

| 1:17:56| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| 12C is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4677)|
| 1:18:00| Zoning Regulations, to revise Article IV, Specific District Regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4680)|
| 1:18:03| and Article VII, Administration and Enforcement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4683)|
| 1:18:06| in order to accomplish reorganization of said articles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| But before there's a second, there will be some other procedural things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4691)|
| 1:18:15| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4695)|
| 1:18:16| Okay, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4696)|
| 1:18:17| Go ahead, Mr. Whitson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4697)|
| 1:18:19| Okay, Mr. Whitson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| First of all, thank you all for putting this on the floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| so we can talk about it for just a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| In just a minute I will be asking this group to amend this ordinance that's in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| and then asking you to postpone the amended ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| But I'd like to explain how we got here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4713)|
| 1:18:34| and why we're going to do that before we get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4714)|
| 1:18:38| Several months back, Ann Wallace and I were charged with the mission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4718)|
| 1:18:41| of trying to move forward to write and build a form-based code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| for Cumberland Avenue and North Central Cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| So we started into that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4726)|
| 1:18:49| and began a process of biweekly meetings with all the appropriate city staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4729)|
| 1:18:54| We had the engineering staff, the building inspection staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| the law department staff, the community development staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4737)|
| 1:19:00| and our staff working in the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4740)|
| 1:19:03| One of the first issues that came up as you looked at this was the old Article 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| the current Article 4, and I think most of you are all familiar with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4748)|
| 1:19:11| but it's this sheet of paper right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| and it lists the zoning regulations for the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| from General Agricultural District right through to Number 27,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4757)|
| 1:19:21| the most recent one passed, which is the South Waterfront District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4761)|
| 1:19:25| So there's some cleanup work that we felt like needed to be done there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4765)|
| 1:19:29| before we got started in adding more form-based districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4769)|
| 1:19:32| So we said, okay, that's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| We'll take that on as the first task and do that as part of the form-based process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4774)|
| 1:19:38| As we got into that, then you realize that deep buried within each of these 27 things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| are the enforcement mechanisms and administrative mechanisms for all 27 of these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4783)|
| 1:19:48| So we're thinking, well, what a good idea to bring those all out in front in Article 7| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4788)|
| 1:19:53| so it will be more user-friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4793)|
| 1:19:56| So we kind of took on that task as well as the form-based task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| Now, so our goal throughout this process was to have a content-neutral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4800)|
| 1:20:05| user-friendly renovation, as it were, of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4805)|
| 1:20:10| Now, as we moved forward in it and got to council here two weeks ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| more eyes look at the product, more eyes see more issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| So we postponed it for two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| and we feel like it's appropriate to postpone it again because there's some conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4820)|
| 1:20:24| There are potentially other things specifically in Article 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4824)|
| 1:20:26| closer to Article 7 than anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| We think it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4828)|
| 1:20:30| So what I'd like for you to do at this point in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| I'd like for you to consider would be to amend this ordinance to remove Article 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4832)|
| 1:20:38| Section 4 from the ordinance for future consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| Article 4, Section 4 is the one that deals with the form-based code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| We'd like to pull that out, general provisions of the form-based code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| pull that one out and get it on a track where it moves along with the Cumberland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| and North Central form-based code and have that set of issues over here for discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| and argument and whatever we need to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| and at the same time leave this other document clean so we can discuss the pros| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4861)|
| 1:21:06| and cons of this reorganization that people have worked on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4866)|
| 1:21:09| So that would be step one, if that's amenable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| And then if that's accomplished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| the amended ordinance until we can send the Article 4 or Article 7 amended to the code studio,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4875)|
| 1:21:23| which is a professional consulting group Miss Poplin, Law Director Poplin can talk about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4883)|
| 1:21:27| to review the language to see if that language is consistent with what we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| if it's good, if it's bad, or that sort of thing, to take advantage of those services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4891)|
| 1:21:36| So that's kind of what I'd like to propose that we do tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4896)|
| 1:21:39| and would be happy to answer any questions or take any comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4899)|
| 1:21:43| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4904)|
| 1:21:45| I'd like to make a motion to sever Article 4, Section 4, from what's being considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4905)|
| 1:21:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| That's the motion and second there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| Actually, it's a motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4921)|
| 1:22:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4922)|
| 1:22:03| Motion to amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| So any discussion on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| All those in favor of the amendment, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4931)|
| 1:22:12| I have a motion to postpone this until it has been looked over by code studio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4932)|
| 1:22:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4941)|
| 1:22:22| The motion and second to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4944)|
| 1:22:27| So it's not postponed to a specific date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4947)|
| 1:22:30| It's postponed until an act occurs, which is, I believe, a proper procedural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4950)|
| 1:22:38| Mr. Swanson, just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| Mr. Swanson thinks we're okay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| That's something we don't usually do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| but we looked it up in Robert's Rules today because it's something we don't usually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| And sure enough, you can postpone to a time certain under Robert's Rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4969)|
| 1:22:53| or as a part of postponing to a time certain until a definite event occurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4973)|
| 1:22:59| And the event in this case would be the examination of the proposed ordinance by the code's people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4979)|
| 1:23:05| So we could, like, postpone something until the cows come home?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| If you could identify the cows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4989)|
| 1:23:14| Mr. Holquist, before this deteriorates further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4994)|
| 1:23:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4996)|
| 1:23:17| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4998)|
| 1:23:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=4999)|
| 1:23:20| We're now voting on the motion to postpone until we get the information back from code studio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=5000)|
| 1:23:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=5009)|
| 1:23:30| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=5011)|
| 1:23:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=5012)|
| 1:23:33| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=5013)|
| 1:23:34| Thanks, Bob.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080826?start=5014)|
