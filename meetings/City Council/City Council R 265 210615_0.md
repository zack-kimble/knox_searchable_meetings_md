| 0:08:42| Council members have some reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=522)|

| 0:08:47| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=527)|
| 0:08:49| First, I'd like to recognize that June is Gun Violence Awareness Month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=529)|
| 0:08:56| I don't know if we have any of our Moms Demand Action members or volunteers here with us today or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=536)|
| 0:09:02| I'd like to ask you to please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=542)|
| 0:09:04| I just want to recognize Moms Demand Action, which is an organization that is dedicated to gun safety and gun violence awareness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=544)|
| 0:09:12| and we want to thank you for all that you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| We know that there's a national increase in gun violence across our country as well as our state and our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=555)|
| 0:09:21| One of the things that I'd like to bring to everyone's attention that Moms Demand Action is promoting is the Be Smart Gun Safety Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=561)|
| 0:09:29| and that is a program that's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=569)|
| 0:09:31| It's a presentation that's anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes, and after a person successfully goes through the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=571)|
| 0:09:37| they are given a gun storage box that has a key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| So often when we talk about gun violence, we do know that we have, we do encourage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| and I am a legal, responsibly trained gun owner myself, but accidents can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=589)|
| 0:09:57| And so one of the things I certainly appreciate Moms Demand Action taking a look at is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=597)|
| 0:10:01| how do we educate people about safe gun storage in your home when you have a legal gun?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| And so I just wanted to shout out to Moms Demand Action and thank you for all that you do in staying in this fight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=607)|
| 0:10:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=613)|
| 0:10:15| The next thing that I'd like to do, and Mayor, thank you very much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=615)|
| 0:10:19| I think most of you know that we are honored today to have the Austin-East State Championship Soccer Team with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=619)|

| 0:21:39| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Councilmember Parker, we use a third-party review council that evaluates the viability of the project based on a multitude of different factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1300)|
| 0:21:53| In this case, the county used the same third-party review firm, and the report is attached to your AIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1313)|
| 0:22:02| If you have specific questions about their process or calculations, I might be able to answer those and would ask for help from my colleague over on the county side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1322)|
| 0:22:18| One question I had is that when it comes to sources of funding in their analysis, it seems very limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1338)|
| 0:22:26| and I was wondering if the third-party company is basing that listing of sources of funding available for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1346)|
| 0:22:39| Is it based on what the developer has submitted, or are they actually doing the research to determine if there are other sources of funding for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1359)|
| 0:22:48| They actually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| It is a third-party review, so they are not relying on the developer's numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1370)|
| 0:22:57| Of course, they do look at the developer's numbers, but that verification comes from other sources of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1377)|
| 0:23:05| that are either industry standards or market research that they're doing in our market related to projects that have a similar type of focus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1385)|
| 0:23:18| I didn't see this in the analysis. I may have missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| There's no discussion or analysis of the opportunities available to this development with being located in an opportunity zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1402)|
| 0:23:34| Was that included in the analysis, and I missed it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| Not all projects that are located in an opportunity zone are putting together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1418)|
| 0:23:47| They're not required, nor are some of them appropriate to pull together an opportunity fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1427)|
| 0:23:54| There's a very specific process involved in making that happen, and not every project within the opportunity zone is appropriate to go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1434)|
| 0:24:09| My understanding of opportunity zones is that hotels are the number one most appropriate project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| and it's disappointing to me that this project has been under discussion for so long that that opportunity was not pursued as a funding option for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1455)|
| 0:24:33| perhaps because there's been talk for so long of there being some sort of public funding support for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1473)|
| 0:24:44| But what I'm struggling with is I don't see a full analysis of all of the opportunities available for a property like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1484)|
| 0:24:56| I do not see funding opportunities pursued over the last several years as this has been discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1496)|
| 0:25:04| and I'm not convinced that a hotel developed at this location would not be successful without public funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1504)|
| 0:25:14| Those are my observations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1514)|
| 0:25:18| Thank you, Council Member Parker. Council Member Testerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1518)|
| 0:25:22| I just wanted to know sort of the logic from establishing the 143 residential units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1522)|
| 0:25:30| and the conversion of them into hotel rooms, and I don't know if that's based on a steady stream of revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| and then converted just not knowing the occupancy rates, et cetera. I'm just kind of interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1536)|
| 0:25:44| Mr. Caldwell looks like he's ready to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1544)|
| 0:25:47| Mr. Caldwell, if you can just start by stating your name and address for the record, and thank you for coming to our council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1547)|
| 0:25:52| Thank you for having me. Chris Caldwell, 400 Main Street, City County Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| Ultimately, when this project was started was, of course, before the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| and the plan from the developer included hotels. It actually was a boutique hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1562)|
| 0:26:10| Since then, funding for hotels is hard to get from a financing standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| so he has changed his model and is going to do micro-apartments, and within five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1576)|
| 0:26:21| turn those back into hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1581)|
| 0:26:29| Is that a guarantee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Yeah, we put that in there. It has to be done in five years, and part of his pilot is tied to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1590)|
| 0:26:37| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| Thank you. Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| Seeing none, all those – oh, sorry, didn't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| It took me a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1607)|
| 0:26:48| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1608)|
| 0:26:49| Thank you, Mayor. I just want to talk through some of the numbers, just because we are –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1609)|
| 0:26:56| it's public assistance once again, and that's something that I think we should look at very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1616)|
| 0:27:03| And from the discussion that I had with Deputy Mayor Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1623)|
| 0:27:08| we were talking about the rate of return without public assistance would be almost 10%, 9.9%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1628)|
| 0:27:16| So it picks up their profit margin to 12.3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1636)|
| 0:27:21| And I am wondering, for that difference, what are the people of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1641)|
| 0:27:27| How does that benefit the people of Knoxville?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1647)|
| 0:27:30| Between I realize it's not on the tax rolls right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1650)|
| 0:27:34| what kind of money do we think we're going to be getting in from taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| Do we need another hotel downtown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| And the prices of apartments are so expensive downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| I'm wondering – it's still hard to believe that it's not feasible without a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1665)|
| 0:27:53| Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1673)|
| 0:27:55| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| Yes, I appreciated our conversation earlier today as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| And, you know, again, to go back to the third-party review firm that we use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1681)|
| 0:28:07| looks at industry standards around market viability of projects that are like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1687)|
| 0:28:15| and what does the market tell us about how investors are able to, A, secure additional funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1695)|
| 0:28:23| This isn't only about the investor's ability to make a return on their investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1703)|
| 0:28:29| They also have to be able to put together a financing package that includes revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1709)|
| 0:28:35| and loans generated from other sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| And these types of real estate investments are risky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1718)|
| 0:28:44| I mean, there is risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1724)|
| 0:28:46| We realized that just the last year in how the market has sort of gone up and down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| and the ability of developers to make their projects work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| So all of those factors are taken into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| when determining what is a viable rate of return for a project to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1739)|
| 0:29:06| And this project, if you look at the report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1746)|
| 0:29:10| it looks like a 12% to 20% return is what would attract other dollars to make the project work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1750)|
| 0:29:18| And so moving it, even from that 9.9%, it seems like a very small amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| But for that developer to be able to get those other dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1763)|
| 0:29:26| and make the risk worth that other investment, that 12.3% I think is what it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1766)|
| 0:29:34| was a viable rate of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1774)|
| 0:29:37| I hope that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1777)|
| 0:29:39| And how are we foreseeing that this will help the larger picture of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1779)|
| 0:29:44| with taxes, with bringing in tourism?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| So the most direct benefit that we can see, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| is we have office jobs that are going to stay downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| I think that's really important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| that it's not that these are jobs that are moving out of our city to another location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1800)|
| 0:30:05| These are jobs that are staying in an important function in our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1805)|
| 0:30:09| Obviously, the school's administration offices are moving to another government-owned building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1809)|
| 0:30:15| And so that allows this building to be redeveloped and come onto the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| It's currently producing no tax revenue, property tax revenue, for the city or county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1821)|
| 0:30:29| If the pilot is approved and when the agreement is negotiated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1829)|
| 0:30:35| they will be paying about $110,000 a year in a pilot payment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1835)|
| 0:30:40| that will come back to the city and county proportionately based on our tax rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| And at the conclusion of the pilot, which is a 12-year pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1846)|
| 0:30:51| the estimate is that that tax revenue will go up to about $600,000 to $700,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1851)|
| 0:30:58| So remember, zero property tax revenue now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| This particular project includes a commercial component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| which will generate additional sales tax revenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1865)|
| 0:31:09| and then those office jobs that are already downtown are staying here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1869)|
| 0:31:14| and there will be additional jobs related to the function of the hotel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1874)|
| 0:31:19| And I could go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| I mean, we have a lot of new attractions in our city that aren't just drawing tourists from, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1882)|
| 0:31:30| and they are drawing tourists from around the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1890)|
| 0:31:33| We have world-class attractions, including our urban wilderness and the zoo,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| and, you know, we have conventions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1897)|
| 0:31:39| We have a great cycling event this weekend, and the list goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| But lots of people who just come into Knoxville from the region who are coming into a city to enjoy the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| and our hotel occupancy rates are high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| That was a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| Do we have the capacity?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| We need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1918)|
| 0:31:59| Ms. Singh, could you speak into the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| So very generally, in general numbers, it's about $500,000 a year for 12 years that we won't be collecting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1921)|
| 0:32:09| but we don't collect anything right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| And have there been other investors looking at the property, interested, any other options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1934)|
| 0:32:20| That may be a question for Mr. Caldwell to answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| They went through a competitive process to secure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| Yes, there was a competitive RFP three or four years ago, and BNA was the winning bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1948)|
| 0:32:38| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| Thank you, Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1963)|
| 0:32:44| So for the record, just to clarify, Ms. Welch, how long is the pilot period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1964)|
| 0:32:50| Twelve years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1971)|
| 0:32:53| And after the analysis by the third party, it's down to 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1973)|
| 0:32:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1978)|
| 0:32:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1979)|
| 0:33:00| Currently, zero comes into the tax rolls from this building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1983)|
| 0:33:04| Mr. Caldwell, this may be a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| Maybe give me a three-sentence answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| I don't need a lot, but just for the record, I think it's important because this has been a process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| and a project that's mostly been discussed at County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1993)|
| 0:33:17| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1997)|
| 0:33:18| Because it is county property, and just what initiated this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| Why are we doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| The project was initiated to get the A.J. building back on the tax rolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2006)|
| 0:33:33| and to get better office space for our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| And by doing that, we also entered into a partnership with UT Systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2017)|
| 0:33:43| And so now we not only have the school system staying downtown, but we get the flagship university.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2023)|
| 0:33:49| So we brought UT Jobs downtown as well in that partnership?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| And they were kind of divvied up across the city, and so they're going to be consolidated downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2033)|
| 0:34:02| So that is an added advantage of this deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2042)|
| 0:34:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2046)|
| 0:34:07| Ms. Welch, the commercial square footage for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| Gosh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2053)|
| 0:34:14| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2054)|
| 0:34:15| Or ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| And I apologize to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2056)|
| 0:34:17| The developer was planning on being here, but his wife went into labor today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| So we felt like that was a decent reason for him not to show up at tonight's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2063)|
| 0:34:29| So he would have been able to answer that, but Mr. Caldwell might be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| I was trying to think how—I think the A.J. is about 130,000 square feet, if I remember correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2073)|
| 0:34:42| And so I know that they're planning on commercial on the bottom floor and then a rooftop bar on the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2082)|
| 0:34:51| Now, I'm not going to do math in public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2091)|
| 0:34:53| It's never really good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Isn't that your forte is math?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| It is, but I'm telling you, it still doesn't work in public for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| And so that's what you're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| And then you have the condos and micro apartments to do everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2102)|
| 0:35:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2108)|
| 0:35:09| And then a question for either you or Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| So the agreement that they're going to be micro units and converted to hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2112)|
| 0:35:17| if the market is somehow different, there will be a new agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2117)|
| 0:35:24| Like if somehow that's not going to work, that will be revisited?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| Because, you know, we're where we are with building materials and hotel rooms because of a pandemic no one expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2128)|
| 0:35:37| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| What we did in the development agreement was tied the pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| So if the developer in five years does not convert the micro apartments to a hotel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| then 50% of his pilot is tied to that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| And so if he doesn't convert it, now we know what's in his best interest to convert it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| because there's more money in hotels than there are in micro apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2163)|
| 0:36:09| And there's hotel-motel tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2169)|
| 0:36:11| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2171)|
| 0:36:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2172)|
| 0:36:13| So there's clawback?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2173)|
| 0:36:15| There's clawback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2175)|
| 0:36:16| There's clawback as far as from us, from the pilot's payment standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| Thank you for your answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2181)|
| 0:36:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2185)|
| 0:36:26| No, go ahead, Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| They're estimating approximately 13,700 square feet of commercial space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2188)|
| 0:36:37| Thank you, Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| Thank you, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| Councilmember Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2201)|
| 0:36:42| Councilwoman Ryder, you asked one of my questions, but the second one was, Deputy Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2202)|
| 0:36:46| not everybody that comes to ask for a pilot gets approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2206)|
| 0:36:49| Can you talk a little bit about how many come to the office to be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2209)|
| 0:36:54| and how many make it through to the third party?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| I'm relatively new to this particular position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| What I can say is that there are applicants that don't ever even make it to the third-party review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| and there have been applicants that have made it to the third-party review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| and have not been recommended for a pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| Their project has been found to be financially viable without any assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2234)|
| 0:37:18| I don't have those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2238)|
| 0:37:20| I could get those for you, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2240)|
| 0:37:22| No, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2242)|
| 0:37:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2243)|
| 0:37:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| I was actually surprised to see this come before council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2246)|
| 0:37:30| because I thought the county was able to approve pilots without city action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2250)|
| 0:37:38| When it's over 10 years, it requires city council approval as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2258)|
| 0:37:42| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| Ten years with a commercial component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2267)|
| 0:37:49| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| Yeah, and I just think it's important to clarify for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2271)|
| 0:37:54| because of some of the conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| there is no exchange of money in terms of we're not giving them any money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2276)|
| 0:38:02| the county's not giving them any money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| It's a tax freeze that makes the project viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2288)|
| 0:38:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| Thank you, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2292)|
| 0:38:13| Councilmember Parker, is your light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2296)|

| 0:42:05| Mr. Cannon, could you just touch on, for the record, what complete streets are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| and how this benefits that corridor and the neighborhoods?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| Harold Cannon, Director of Engineering, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2535)|
| 0:42:21| A portion of Woodland already has bike lanes on it, designated bike lanes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| as well as sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| but they do not continue on to Broadway in a safe manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| nor is the intersection at Broadway such that just merely striping on the side of the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2551)|
| 0:42:38| for a bike lane, it would create an unsafe condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| What this will do is continue the sidewalk on the south side of Woodland to a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| There will be a crossing over to which there will be on the north side, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2568)|
| 0:42:54| there will be a multi-use path that will serve both pedestrians and bikes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2574)|
| 0:42:59| It's important on that side of the street to have the multi-use path| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| because that will get the bikes off of Woodland on the uphill grade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| so that they will not be, if you will, fighting the grade and traffic at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2586)|
| 0:43:12| We're making some modifications to the design so that we can protect one of the businesses on Woodland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2592)|
| 0:43:18| We're also making some modifications to the configuration, if you will, of the bike lanes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2598)|
| 0:43:23| and the interaction with traffic when they do reenter the travelway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2603)|
| 0:43:28| Part of what we have to be sensitive to is, I call this a local commercial corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2608)|
| 0:43:34| connecting Broadway to Central, and therefore there will be small delivery trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2614)|
| 0:43:38| We want to make sure that everybody is, if you will, behaving through that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2618)|
| 0:43:43| and that we've created as safe a condition as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2623)|
| 0:43:46| while at the same time taking into account connectivity to the 1st Street Greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| So the redesigns or the changes and modifications in the current plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2632)|
| 0:43:56| will there be an opportunity to see them before work begins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2636)|
| 0:44:02| Absolutely. Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2642)|
| 0:44:04| In fact, our intent is that those would be seen in conjunction with the 1st Street Greenway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| so that everybody can see how those projects come together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| Mesh together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2653)|

| 0:44:39| for the Broadway Shopping Center, and for Fulton High School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2679)|

| 0:47:21| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2841)|
| 0:47:22| Becky Wade, Director of Housing and Neighborhood Development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| This is a one-year contract for the Joy Baker Center and they will be serving that many clients during the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2845)|
| 0:47:36| Joy Baker Center is a shelter for women and children, those suffering from domestic violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2856)|
| 0:47:47| There is a representative here from Salvation Army, so if you have any other specific questions, I'll be happy to ask her to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2867)|
| 0:47:59| Yes, I was just wanting to know how many individuals they're able to serve currently and also whether it's congregate shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2879)|
| 0:48:10| Could the person from Salvation Army please come up to the podium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2894)|
| 0:48:16| And if you could start by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2896)|
| 0:48:22| Hi, my name is Donna Wright and I am the Social Services Director for the Salvation Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2902)|
| 0:48:27| And I did not quite hear your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| My question was how many individuals the Joy D. Baker Center is currently able to serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2910)|
| 0:48:37| Our capacity is 28, no, 26 individuals, women and children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2917)|
| 0:48:43| And can you tell me more about your plan to serve 150 individuals over the course of this, over, I guess, the course of a calendar year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2923)|
| 0:48:55| Well, it depends on the makeup of the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| That is our target number that we propose to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2938)|
| 0:49:04| And during COVID, it depends on, you know, the mandates for COVID, if we have to social distance or any other factor that may come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2944)|
| 0:49:16| And in general, how would you expect to identify individuals in need of shelter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2956)|
| 0:49:24| Are they referred to you? Is there a waiting list of individuals that you anticipate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2964)|
| 0:49:30| They are referred, walk-ins, callers, and word of mouth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2970)|
| 0:49:37| No waiting list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2977)|
| 0:49:38| I didn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2978)|
| 0:49:40| No waiting list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| Not currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2982)|
| 0:49:44| And I'm imagining it must be a congregate shelter rather than individual rooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2984)|
| 0:49:51| We have individual rooms, but yet it's congregate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| It can hold more than one individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2994)|
| 0:49:58| And it is a first-come, first-served basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=2998)|
| 0:50:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3006)|

| 0:52:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| So the City, County, and City combined, there's about 10 outreach workers, so this would put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3155)|
| 0:52:39| us up to 12, but this is going to serve a specific target population?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3159)|

| 0:53:40| So this is new and novel as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3220)|
| 0:53:43| This is increasing the number of beds at the facility that is operating now, and it's also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3223)|
| 0:53:50| increasing the age limit up to age 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3230)|
| 0:53:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3234)|
| 0:53:55| So it's serving 18 to 24, but not under age 18?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3235)|
| 0:53:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| And this is a, one of the issues, a population of folks that we end up with new to homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3241)|
| 0:54:10| are people who are aging out of foster care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| So this is intended to serve that population?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| It does serve that population, but it also serves other youth in that age group that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3257)|

| 0:55:29| to move away from congregate shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| And so as we are investing so much into organizations and thinking about how can we increase our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3332)|
| 0:55:41| housing options for individuals, I'm just wondering if we're just assuming, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3341)|
| 0:55:47| we should continue with things as they have been, or are we exploring what our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3347)|
| 0:55:54| needs, who will fill the beds, whether we will see another demographic resistant to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3354)|
| 0:56:03| this type of shelter we're providing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| That's why I'm asking about wait lists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| Are there people who want a bed in this space and are waiting for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3368)|
| 0:56:15| Can you answer those questions at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3375)|
| 0:56:18| I'm not sure I understand completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| I know we are investigating lots of different options for shelter, whether that's existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| type shelter, congregate, or non-congregate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3387)|
| 0:56:30| And we've been in conversations with the providers regarding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| We do fund non-congregate shelter through several agencies for families and young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3395)|
| 0:56:42| And agencies such as McNabb Center do provide shelter in hotels and things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3402)|
| 0:56:50| So that does exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3410)|
| 0:56:52| We would like to expand that to more of a, you know, a non-congregate shelter that can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3412)|
| 0:56:59| then be transitioned into permanent housing at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3419)|
| 0:57:02| And so we are exploring those options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| We haven't gotten to the end of it at this point, but we're definitely looking into those situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3425)|
| 0:57:12| But would you say for what's before us tonight, we have not yet identified who will fill those beds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3432)|

| 1:00:25| But I think the plan for this property and also 11U was to incorporate them into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3625)|
| 1:00:37| Homemakers Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3637)|
| 1:00:39| Ms. Wade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| Once the city acquires property that's determined blighted and certified blighted, it is listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3641)|
| 1:00:46| for sale through our Homemakers Program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| I would really like to see the city make a transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3650)|
| 1:00:57| As we're seeing property values skyrocket and housing values skyrocket, I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3657)|
| 1:01:04| we can think of other uses for land that we acquire that help us maintain affordable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3664)|
| 1:01:11| housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3671)|
| 1:01:12| And we have the Affordable Housing Trust Fund, which encourages the city to consider new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3672)|
| 1:01:23| creative ideas like community land trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3683)|
| 1:01:27| And, you know, there's going to be a need for land to be able to start those types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3687)|
| 1:01:34| projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| And so, for me, it's concerning to see, you know, I see how long of a process this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3695)|
| 1:01:42| for each property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3702)|
| 1:01:43| And I realize that, you know, there can be a big shift in a city over a four-year period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3703)|
| 1:01:51| And maybe initially the plan was to incorporate it into Homemakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| But I would really like for us to start thinking about how can we, once properties are acquired| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3715)|
| 1:02:02| that are blighted, what are other uses that we could incorporate that is needed in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3722)|
| 1:02:09| city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| Thank you, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3731)|
| 1:02:13| Ms. Wade, if you could just give us a short overview of the Homemakers Program so we understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3733)|
| 1:02:18| how that works and who it serves and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3738)|
| 1:02:22| Yeah, the Homemakers Program is a disposition program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3742)|
| 1:02:26| It's the way the city sells properties that are acquired either primarily through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3746)|
| 1:02:33| blight process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| We also do sell occasionally tax-foreclosed properties, but that's once title has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3754)|
| 1:02:41| cleared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3761)|
| 1:02:42| The program was established to create new housing opportunities in neighborhoods on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| vacant lots and through the rehabilitation of blighted structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| It's listed for sale through Homemakers because the city then has some teeth in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3774)|
| 1:03:01| They're able to ensure that whoever purchases this property has the funds to actually do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3781)|
| 1:03:09| something with it in a timely fashion, and if they cannot do it within a certain period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3789)|
| 1:03:15| of time, then the city can take the property back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| So unlike an auction or a tax sale where you have no control after the property is sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3798)|
| 1:03:26| the city does maintain that control until the project is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3806)|
| 1:03:32| It's to ensure that blight is remediated in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3812)|
| 1:03:36| That was the reason for the Homemakers Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3819)|

| 1:03:42| Ms. Swain, I was just going to follow up with that and say I also think it's a big part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| of the Neighborhood Stabilization Program that the city is interested in, which is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3826)|
| 1:03:51| stabilize neighborhoods and remove blight and replace it with an owner-occupied structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3831)|
| 1:03:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| It's to take properties that have had disinvestment or vacancy for many, many years and put it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3838)|
| 1:04:05| back into functioning use, put it on the tax rolls, and revitalize the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3845)|

| 1:04:17| Yes, just to add a little bit to Council Member Fugate's remark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| Yeah, these properties by nature have usually been blighted for quite a long time, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3861)|
| 1:04:28| they've been in these neighborhoods where the situation has lasted usually sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3868)|
| 1:04:35| for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3875)|
| 1:04:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3876)|
| 1:04:37| And so the Homemakers Program gives an assurance, actually, to the neighborhood that the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| owner will be monitored and that this won't continue as it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3882)|
| 1:04:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| Yes, you said it better than I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| Thank you, Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3892)|
| 1:04:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3893)|
| 1:04:54| Ms. Wade, I just wanted to clarify, they can also be rentals, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3899)|
| 1:05:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| It doesn't have to be owner-occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3901)|
| 1:05:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3902)|
| 1:05:03| So you guys have a committee that reviews, you post the homes or the properties, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3903)|
| 1:05:09| then it's reviewed by a committee, and your committee decides which ones meet the highest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3909)|
| 1:05:15| and, not highest and best use, but best for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3915)|
| 1:05:18| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| And I know you guys have used criteria like ADA, Energy Star, visitability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| Affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3925)|
| 1:05:26| Affordability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3926)|
| 1:05:27| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3927)|
| 1:05:28| And I can say I know of one on Anderson that you had multiple applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3928)|
| 1:05:37| One person wanted it as a side yard, and someone else wanted it to build a home, and you chose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3937)|
| 1:05:44| the housing over someone's yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3944)|
| 1:05:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| That kind of game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3948)|
| 1:05:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3949)|
| 1:05:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3950)|
| 1:05:51| And I will just say, I know some of the tax sale properties recently were properties that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| were previously, this is not a comment on any staff or anything, I just, tax sale properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3957)|
| 1:06:03| is something I think we need to look at in the future, because sometimes tax sale properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3963)|
| 1:06:09| end up being, again, tax sale properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| I know one in particular off Woodland, that's exactly what happened, because there is no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3972)|
| 1:06:17| clawback, there is no teeth, and many people buy something at tax sale, and they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3977)|
| 1:06:23| know that they don't have a clear title, and what the restrictions are on the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3983)|
| 1:06:28| and how it can be used, and they find out that it's not such a great deal, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3988)|
| 1:06:33| it's very difficult to build upon it or use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3997)|
| 1:06:38| So I have some issue with some of the things that go out for tax sale, and they sit and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=3998)|
| 1:06:44| they become blighted properties again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| Thank you, Council Member Rodger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4009)|
| 1:06:50| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4010)|
| 1:06:51| I'm not sure if you directly answered this, I may have missed it, but the concept of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4011)|
| 1:06:56| land trust, is that something that, as a city, would be a better tool to keep some housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4016)|
| 1:07:03| affordable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4023)|
| 1:07:04| Just a small question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4027)|
| 1:07:08| I'm not an expert on land trusts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4028)|
| 1:07:10| I know that there may be two in the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| I know there's some state law that may not allow us to do land trusts at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4033)|
| 1:07:21| but it's certainly something that we are looking into, especially with the new affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4041)|
| 1:07:26| trust fund that's been established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4046)|
| 1:07:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4049)|
| 1:07:30| Ms. Wade, do some of the people who buy the homemaker properties are affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4050)|
| 1:07:37| partners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| Absolutely, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4058)|
| 1:07:40| Can you just speak to some of those examples?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| Well, we've sold many lots over the years to Habitat for Humanity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| We've sold lots to HomeSource of East Tennessee, which used to be KHP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4068)|
| 1:07:53| So there are a lot of nonprofit housing developers that purchase lots through homemakers for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4073)|
| 1:07:59| affordable home ownership, but recently we've had a lot of activity with developers buying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4079)|
| 1:08:06| lots from homemakers building new for rental for people with vouchers, particularly in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4086)|
| 1:08:12| the Lonsdale neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4092)|
| 1:08:14| So we've increased the supply of single-family affordable rental housing as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4094)|
| 1:08:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4101)|
| 1:08:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4102)|
| 1:08:23| Council Member Parker, and then back to Council Member Rodger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| The point that I wanted to make was not that there are not, you know, some positive outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4106)|
| 1:08:33| that can come from the Homemakers Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| My point is that, especially since we are in such a crisis state at this point in terms of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4116)|
| 1:08:42| housing stock, we've got to incorporate new initiatives, and I don't think we can just rely on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4122)|
| 1:08:50| the Homemakers Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4130)|
| 1:08:52| I realize that there is some research being done on affordable housing trust funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4132)|
| 1:08:57| You know, I would love to see these two properties held for a couple of months until we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4137)|
| 1:09:03| some more research so we can see if we can push go now on incorporating some of those more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4143)|
| 1:09:11| long-term sustainable strategies for maintaining affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4151)|
| 1:09:17| I would love a report, and I need to figure out how to get that report, on the Homemakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4157)|
| 1:09:25| Program to see what has it done to our housing values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4165)|
| 1:09:30| How has it contributed to the increasing home values that we see?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4170)|
| 1:09:37| And until we understand that as we see home values increasing exponentially and low-income| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4177)|
| 1:09:45| individuals having less and fewer and fewer choices for housing, I think we have to be really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4185)|
| 1:09:51| intentional about the public property that we are managing and ensuring that we are addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4191)|
| 1:09:58| those with the most need in our community, prioritizing those with the most need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4198)|
| 1:10:03| Thank you, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4203)|
| 1:10:04| Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| Ms. Wade, ballpark, I guess it's based on dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| How many properties go through Homemakers a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| Around 30, I would guess, are sold through Homemakers annually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| Oh, it's that many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4221)|
| 1:10:22| I thought it was less than five or ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| No, it's probably, I mean, the program has been in existence for a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| So just averaging it out, it's probably around 30 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4230)|
| 1:10:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4236)|
| 1:10:37| I think it's really important to clarify for everyone that the really important part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| Homemakers is that it clears the title of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4244)|
| 1:10:45| That's the critical, critical piece, clears the title so that the property can become| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4245)|
| 1:10:50| something reusable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4250)|
| 1:10:54| When properties go into tax sale, what would it take for properties to go, instead of through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4254)|
| 1:11:00| tax sale where they, most of them, many of them end up languishing, what would it take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4260)|
| 1:11:07| for them to go through Homemakers instead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4267)|
| 1:11:09| Well, they'd have to be certified and determined and certified blighted in order for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4269)|
| 1:11:18| be able to clear title and sell them again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4278)|
| 1:11:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4283)|
| 1:11:24| So how does that happen with an empty lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4284)|
| 1:11:28| It goes through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4288)|
| 1:11:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| It goes through the same exact lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4290)|
| 1:11:31| It can be certified blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4291)|
| 1:11:32| It doesn't have to have a structure on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4292)|
| 1:11:33| It can be a vacant lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4296)|

| 1:14:45| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4485)|
| 1:14:50| So the moratorium extends the pilot program but does not allow other companies to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4490)|
| 1:14:59| to Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4499)|
| 1:15:00| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4500)|
| 1:15:01| If two companies will continue to operate, the additional companies cannot come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4501)|
| 1:15:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4506)|
| 1:15:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4507)|
| 1:15:11| Is there a reason why this continues to be postponed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4511)|
| 1:15:14| Yeah, I'm going to ask Carter Hall to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4514)|
| 1:15:17| He's been leading our efforts to address these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4517)|
| 1:15:21| So, Mr. Hall, if you could speak to Council Member Parker's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| Start by introducing yourself and stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| Thank you very much, Mayor McCannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4530)|

| 1:15:38| And the question being, why do we continue to keep bringing on the moratorium extension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4538)|
| 1:15:45| So, the last time I believe I spoke to you all last year for this extension, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4545)|
| 1:15:51| we were in the middle of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4551)|
| 1:15:53| Scooter operations had been postponed for multiple months at that point, and it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| hey, they aren't operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4557)|
| 1:15:59| We need a little bit more time to help gather research and do things like a community input survey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4559)|
| 1:16:06| which we have completed with Visit Knoxville at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4566)|
| 1:16:10| We are just continuing our process of doing research, gathering what other cities have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4570)|
| 1:16:16| to really address specifically certain pain points around the scooter program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4576)|
| 1:16:21| things like clutter on sidewalks, things like people riding the scooters on the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4581)|
| 1:16:26| And then also, you know, ways to help leverage scooters to provide a more sustainable option for getting around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4586)|
| 1:16:34| rather than using a car, things like helping with mobility equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4594)|
| 1:16:40| things that we've seen other cities use scooters for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| And so, just really making sure that we have a well-thought-out, thorough program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4603)|
| 1:16:48| At this point, we feel like we are in a good direction on a lot of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4608)|
| 1:16:54| What we plan on using the next max six months for would be public input on the ideas, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4614)|
| 1:17:04| that we've put together at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| And what's the status of electric bicycles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| That is a great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| We currently do not have electric bicycles in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4632)|
| 1:17:15| That is actually one of the things that we are looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| is how to work with the vendors to bring electric bicycles here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4637)|
| 1:17:22| The problem is that electric bicycles aren't as much of a market incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4642)|
| 1:17:27| There's not a huge market incentive for the vendors to have electric bicycles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4647)|
| 1:17:31| So that's where we want our policy to basically work with the vendors to bring them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4651)|
| 1:17:37| We're not sure if that will shake out, but that's something that we've been looking into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| I've been missing wanting the electric bicycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4661)|
| 1:17:46| I was wondering if our postponement or the extension of this pilot and who we're limiting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4666)|
| 1:17:52| is also going to limit or, I guess, postpone when we see electric bicycles and not so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4672)|
| 1:17:59| Yeah, unfortunately, at this point, it looks like, and this is a whole market-based thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4679)|
| 1:18:04| where there's not that many companies that just do electric bike rentals now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4684)|
| 1:18:07| It really is your vendors who also do scooters, also do bikes, also do things like mopeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4687)|
| 1:18:14| So, like I said, it's really going to be working with vendors that are bringing the scooters to also say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4694)|
| 1:18:20| hey, if you want to bring scooters here, we also would like you to bring e-bikes or bike shares as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4700)|
| 1:18:26| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4706)|
| 1:18:27| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4707)|
| 1:18:28| Thank you, Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4708)|
| 1:18:30| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4710)|
| 1:18:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| I also assume that this delay, when you talk about pain points, yes, there are pain points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4712)|
| 1:18:38| I hear it a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| Left on the sidewalks, left on the side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4720)|
| 1:18:43| I assume that, because my understanding now is that vendors are not required to collect them at the end of the day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4723)|
| 1:18:51| and put them back, or are they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4731)|
| 1:18:54| Vendors are required to rebalance a scooter, which means that if a scooter is, say, like tipped over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4734)|
| 1:19:00| or it's not in line with our regulations around where it needs to be on a sidewalk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4740)|
| 1:19:07| say it's too close to an ADA ramp or too close to the curb,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| they are required at the end of the day to go reset those scooters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| but they are not required to go round them all up and specifically place them in certain spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4753)|
| 1:19:20| So I would hope that that's part of what you're looking at as you are doing this study?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4760)|
| 1:19:25| Yes, is definitely how to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4765)|
| 1:19:28| As you pointed out, clutter on sidewalks is the number one thing that we're looking at to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4768)|
| 1:19:33| Oh, and it's dangerous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4773)|
| 1:19:35| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4775)|
| 1:19:36| One of the things that we are really looking at is something that a lot of cities have implemented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| and that we've worked with even at the academic level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| There are professors at universities, including UT, who look at how to implement certain corralled parking spots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4785)|
| 1:19:52| to get them off the sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| That's something that we're looking at really thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| So this moratorium would keep anybody else from coming until we get all that figured out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4796)|
| 1:20:03| before we let anybody else perhaps come into the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4803)|
| 1:20:07| And it will let us continue to work with the vendors that we currently have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4807)|
| 1:20:10| which across most vendors also see these problems and want to be a partner in helping to fix them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4810)|
| 1:20:18| So it will keep us to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| I just want to make sure the community knows that part of this extension and moratorium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4819)|
| 1:20:24| is to work on solutions to the pain points as well, not just to keep people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4824)|
| 1:20:31| It's to work on how to make this work better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4831)|
| 1:20:34| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4835)|

| 1:20:40| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4842)|

| 1:21:09| Council, we have two people signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4869)|
| 1:21:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| Patrick Birmingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4885)|
| 1:21:27| Mr. Birmingham, are you here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| If you could come to the podium, state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| and you'll have up to five minutes to address Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4894)|
| 1:21:37| Yeah, Patrick Birmingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4897)|
| 1:21:39| The address is 284 Sanders West Boulevard in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4899)|
| 1:21:45| Yeah, I just want to be on record that the history of this is that we worked with the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4905)|
| 1:21:52| This was kind of a joint venture in speaking on behalf of Covenant Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| as well as I talked with Bruce Hartman at UT Medical Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| and we're in support of this ordinance as it's listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4920)|
| 1:22:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| Next person signed up to speak to this item is Joyce Feld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| Ms. Feld?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4932)|
| 1:22:20| Hi, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| My name is Joyce Feld, 1540 Aguila Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4941)|
| 1:22:29| This amendment to Article 13 of our zoning ordinance has been under consideration for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4949)|
| 1:22:36| Scenic Knoxville is pleased with the result and proud to support the proposed changes before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4956)|
| 1:22:42| We appreciate Planning Commission Director Amy Brooks working closely with community stakeholders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4962)|
| 1:22:48| and thoughtfully addressing our concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4968)|
| 1:22:51| We also want to recognize the helpful input received throughout the process from community forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4971)|
| 1:22:57| And Scenic Knoxville wants to especially thank Councilmember Andrew Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4977)|
| 1:23:02| who from the beginning recognized the importance of codifying unique sign standards for this district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4982)|
| 1:23:08| and who has invested considerable time and effort to bring about this amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4988)|
| 1:23:13| The standards in this amendment are appropriate to the uses that are permitted in the newly created institutional district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=4993)|
| 1:23:20| They are also appropriately placed along a continuum anchored on one end by the sign standards for office districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5000)|
| 1:23:27| and at the other end by the sign standards for commercial and industrial districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5007)|
| 1:23:33| The specific standards for sign height and size are determined by both roadway type and zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5013)|
| 1:23:39| and this model meshes well with other sections of the sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5019)|
| 1:23:43| And as Mr. Birmingham noted, Section 13.7D addresses the unique needs of health care institutions with an on-site emergency room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5023)|
| 1:23:53| This amendment will serve our community well, and Scenic Knoxville respectfully requests that you vote to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5033)|
| 1:24:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5040)|
| 1:24:01| Thank you, Ms. Felt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5041)|
| 1:24:03| Council, that concludes all the people signed up to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| I just want to let everyone know, maybe that's at home or here, that you hear institutional sign standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5048)|
| 1:24:15| and that may not sound like something that you might understand right off the bat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5055)|
| 1:24:23| but in its simplest form, this ordinance provides stand-alone sign standards for the institutional district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5063)|
| 1:24:29| which is a district that we didn't have in the previous zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5069)|
| 1:24:35| So this was a new district created in the zoning code update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5075)|
| 1:24:39| So what we're doing here is providing sign standards for that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5079)|
| 1:24:44| This really is a wonderful example of council's legislative process in action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5084)|
| 1:24:49| and I just have a lot of folks that I want to thank for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5089)|
| 1:24:54| My colleagues on council, we've had lots of votes on this, and it's come up many times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| and I really appreciate your patience and your support throughout this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5099)|
| 1:25:03| Director Brooks, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| Deputies to the Mayor, Welch and Gill, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| Our hospital representatives, I know we heard from Patrick Birmingham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5109)|
| 1:25:13| I appreciate his willingness to appear on Zooms many, many times as we're working on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5113)|
| 1:25:18| Of course, Scenic Knoxville and Community Forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5118)|
| 1:25:22| Really, just thank you all for the time and effort committed to put in to get this to where we are today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5122)|
| 1:25:29| Without everyone's efforts, this wouldn't have happened and wouldn't have been possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| So I just wanted to say thank you to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5133)|
| 1:25:36| Thank you, Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5136)|
| 1:25:38| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5138)|

| 1:25:55| including the Fiscal Year 2022 Capital Improvements Budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5155)|

| 1:26:03| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| Council, the Burlington Streetscape Project included in the Capital Improvement Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5166)|
| 1:26:12| is one part of the Capital Improvement Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| It reflects a long engagement process we have supported with residents and businesses in the Burlington District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| If you all have any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| we have staff here to answer any questions you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5182)|
| 1:26:26| Any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5186)|
| 1:26:28| Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5188)|
| 1:26:31| Well, since you mentioned Burlington, I'll ask a few questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5191)|
| 1:26:35| I attended a community meeting last week in the Burlington community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5195)|
| 1:26:41| and the residents and business owners seemed quite surprised and disappointed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5201)|
| 1:26:49| with how the money was allocated for Burlington in the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5209)|
| 1:26:56| Councilmember Parker, did you have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5223)|
| 1:27:04| And so I hear your opening statement as we begin this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5224)|
| 1:27:10| It doesn't seem like you're open to hearing the concerns of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5230)|
| 1:27:17| That's my question, is would the administration be open to hearing the concerns of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5237)|
| 1:27:24| and reallocating money in the capital plan for Burlington?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5244)|
| 1:27:28| Yeah, I'll just say not only are we open to hearing concerns from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| we have been hearing from the community for several years on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5252)|
| 1:27:35| and I'm really pleased that we're able to move forward on this community-based plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5255)|
| 1:27:39| that reflects the process and input we've gotten from Burlington members, residents, for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5259)|
| 1:27:46| I'm going to ask Ms. Welch to sort of go over the series, this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5266)|
| 1:27:53| and share with Ms. Parker and the rest of Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5273)|
| 1:27:57| It's been a little longer process than we would have hoped,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5277)|
| 1:27:59| but I'm really pleased that we can hopefully move forward tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5279)|
| 1:28:03| And thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5283)|
| 1:28:04| And I'm actually going to pass the baton to my colleague, Charles Lomax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5284)|
| 1:28:08| who has been doing a great job through Community Empowerment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| and continuing to lead a long-term community process in the Burlington neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5291)|
| 1:28:17| So if it's okay, I'll pass it to Mr. Lomax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5300)|
| 1:28:21| Charles Lomax, Director of Community Empowerment, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5301)|
| 1:28:25| This actually, community process-wise, precedes my tenure with the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5305)|
| 1:28:32| and many of those meetings were initiated by Don Michelle Foster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5312)|
| 1:28:37| and members of the Neighborhood Housing and Development team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5317)|
| 1:28:42| that have engaged with the community, held public meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| And since my tenure, we have done at least three public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5325)|
| 1:28:50| one that took place at Greater Warner, a couple that took place at Chilhowee Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5330)|
| 1:28:55| and members of the community were present to give input on their thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| regarding ideas and renderings that were offered by the East Tennessee Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5340)|
| 1:29:11| Thank you. Slipped my mind there for a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5351)|
| 1:29:13| And, again, we were able to get input from the community on what they were hoping to see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5353)|
| 1:29:18| what they desired to see based off of what was presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| and they were able to give input and thought on that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5362)|
| 1:29:26| And so we have reached out to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5366)|
| 1:29:30| Members of my staff and I personally went to Burlington with the Neighborhood Association president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5370)|
| 1:29:36| and knocked on doors to inform meetings, to inform the community of meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| to let them know that we were going to be in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| And members from our team from the Office of Neighborhood Empowerment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5383)|
| 1:29:46| have been present at all of the community meetings as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5386)|
| 1:29:53| Thank you, Dr. Lomax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5393)|
| 1:29:55| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5395)|
| 1:30:00| You know, the only thing that I can speak to are the conversations that I've had with community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5400)|
| 1:30:06| and the meeting that I attended last week in Burlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| It was very clear that the plans moving forward did not reflect what they felt like they had expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5411)|
| 1:30:18| to the administration over the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5418)|
| 1:30:23| They, in fact, even asked that any streetscapes project would be postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5423)|
| 1:30:29| and that there would be a focus on economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5429)|
| 1:30:32| because there's a very real concern of gentrification in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5432)|
| 1:30:38| and that when the city invests in making things pretty in hopes of attracting outside investors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5438)|
| 1:30:48| that, in fact, that's exactly what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| They attract outside investors who have access to capital that local businesses in that community do not have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5451)|
| 1:30:59| And so I think there may be some community members on their way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5459)|
| 1:31:05| and they may be able to speak at public forum at the end of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| So it's unfortunate that they're not here to speak at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| but I encourage the administration to clarify with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5473)|
| 1:31:20| I wish Debbie Sharp were here because she could report back to you from the Office on Neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5480)|
| 1:31:26| what was stated at last week's meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| There was a clear question about the funding in the capital plan and what the source of that funding is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5490)|
| 1:31:38| I reached out to Director Cannon about the source of that funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5498)|
| 1:31:43| and clarified that it was not state or federal funds that were identified for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5503)|
| 1:31:50| It was, indeed, city funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5510)|
| 1:31:52| And so the neighborhood's hope is that there would be some flexibility with those local funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5512)|
| 1:31:59| and they could focus more on their economic development needs in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5519)|
| 1:32:05| rather than the streetscapes program, which has the potential of attracting investors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5525)|
| 1:32:12| with more access to capital than they currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5532)|
| 1:32:17| Thank you, Councilmember Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5539)|
| 1:32:21| Councilwoman Parker, thank you for your comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5541)|
| 1:32:24| I'd like to inquire about the meeting last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5544)|
| 1:32:26| Was that an open meeting of the Burlington Neighborhood Association?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5546)|
| 1:32:29| I think it was called by the Office on Neighborhoods, and I was invited to the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5549)|
| 1:32:35| not by the Office on Neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5557)|
| 1:32:38| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5558)|
| 1:32:39| I guess I'm a little perplexed because I'm not certain that the Burlington Business Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5559)|
| 1:32:47| was aware of that meeting, that association, as well as the greater community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5567)|
| 1:32:52| But if the Office of Neighborhoods actually called that meeting, I guess we can address that with Debbie Sharp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5572)|
| 1:32:56| because I was not aware of that meeting either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5576)|
| 1:32:59| So we'll follow back up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5579)|
| 1:33:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5582)|
| 1:33:04| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| Just to address one of your questions that is about the city doing streetscapes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5586)|
| 1:33:13| I believe that the streetscapes are things that the community wants and does benefit from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| and has asked for and for many years have had to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5597)|
| 1:33:21| So I'm really pleased that we can go forward with enhanced sighting, signage, better lighting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5601)|
| 1:33:26| crosswalks and sidewalks, trees and landscaping, and street furniture such as benches, planters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5606)|
| 1:33:32| trash receptacles, and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5612)|
| 1:33:34| I'm committed to making investments that help the people and businesses who live in the community right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5614)|
| 1:33:39| and also may attract new entrepreneurs who want to invest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| It's not an either-or, it's a both-and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5623)|
| 1:33:46| I'm also really pleased that the city doesn't just invest in capital projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5626)|
| 1:33:49| We have huge investments that help support entrepreneurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5629)|
| 1:33:55| including entrepreneurs in East Knoxville and minority entrepreneurs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5635)|
| 1:33:58| We support the Knoxville Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| We support, in hundreds of thousands of dollars, the Knoxville Area Urban League,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5640)|
| 1:34:06| both of which offer robust business development programming to new and established entrepreneurs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| including financing opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5651)|
| 1:34:13| We support 100 Knox Initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5653)|
| 1:34:16| We are also committed to continuing with our commercial façade and historic preservation funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5656)|
| 1:34:22| which are structured to invest in the physical infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5662)|
| 1:34:25| and have, in the case of commercial façade funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| already been leveraged to support businesses in and around the Burlington District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5667)|
| 1:34:32| So I agree with the need to do the streetscape,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5672)|
| 1:34:36| and I'm looking forward to council support on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| And it's not an either-or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5679)|
| 1:34:41| We support streetscapes, and we also support entrepreneurs in all parts of the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5681)|
| 1:34:46| but including especially entrepreneurs who need access to capital,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| who may welcome the support of the Urban League, the Entrepreneur's Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5689)|
| 1:34:55| and other programs designed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5695)|
| 1:34:58| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5698)|
| 1:35:01| Yeah, can I get some clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| So in the capital budget, which is page 865 of the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5704)|
| 1:35:12| page 21 of the capital improvement project budget, it says federal state grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5712)|
| 1:35:20| but there was a comment that it's local funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| So is it federal and state grants with local match?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| Is it all local dollars on page 21?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5726)|
| 1:35:32| Forgive me, I don't have your page 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5732)|
| 1:35:35| but the funding for this project is 100% local.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5735)|
| 1:35:39| And the hope is that this will be a catalyst for the city to go after future grant dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5739)|
| 1:35:48| in this community and continue the streetscapes work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5748)|
| 1:35:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5753)|
| 1:35:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| So you're specifically saying that the Burlington District Improvements money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5757)|
| 1:36:03| that's specifically being discussed within the capital budget is local dollars?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5763)|
| 1:36:08| Because it says in the packet federal and state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| I'm looking at it right now, thinking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5771)|
| 1:36:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5773)|
| 1:36:14| And that is local dollars for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| I'm not sure why it says the $2 million is a federal state grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| It is local dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5780)|
| 1:36:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5786)|
| 1:36:27| So I guess we need to make a correction to that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5787)|
| 1:36:30| Can we make a correction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5790)|
| 1:36:33| Do we need to make an extra motion to correct the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5793)|
| 1:36:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5798)|
| 1:36:39| Anyone with a legal degree want to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5799)|
| 1:36:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| Well, it's really not part of the ordinance itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5806)|
| 1:36:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5809)|
| 1:36:51| But you can make a statement, or Director Cannon can make a statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5811)|
| 1:36:56| that corrects the record in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5816)|
| 1:36:58| And you have just done that, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5818)|
| 1:37:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5820)|
| 1:37:01| Thank you, Mr. Cannon, for the record for correcting that it's local dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5821)|
| 1:37:04| not federal and state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5824)|
| 1:37:06| And thank you for pointing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5826)|
| 1:37:07| My apology for not catching it sooner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5827)|
| 1:37:09| No worries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| This gets published on the city website,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| so can we make sure that the published version has the correct for that source?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5832)|
| 1:37:18| Yeah, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5838)|
| 1:37:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5839)|
| 1:37:20| I was confused by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5840)|
| 1:37:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5841)|
| 1:37:24| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5844)|
| 1:37:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5845)|
| 1:37:27| I have some concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5847)|
| 1:37:29| I know that when we say community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5849)|
| 1:37:33| that that means many communities within a community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| and it's very difficult to get consensus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| We try to do what's best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| But I do have concerns about that the business association was not involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5861)|
| 1:37:46| in the meeting where I think there are reasonable requests for supporting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5866)|
| 1:37:51| businesses versus the streetscapes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5871)|
| 1:37:57| I'm wondering if we need to postpone this to have more conversations where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5877)|
| 1:38:02| people, different groups of the community are sitting together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5882)|
| 1:38:06| because it's a concern of mine when you lift the way an area looks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5886)|
| 1:38:13| but not the people who live there, that is an aspect of gentrification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| or it can lead to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| So that's a concern that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| Do we need, have we had enough conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| have we included enough people at the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5904)|
| 1:38:27| Council, well, I mean, just to remind council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5907)|
| 1:38:35| there was a year or more long process to talk to all the members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| Burlington community before I took office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| I did remember attending the culmination of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| I think it was in 2019, the East Tennessee Community Design Center had sort of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| celebration and a charrette type thing, and the whole community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5929)|
| 1:38:54| I mean the whole community, a lot of people came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| I think there were residents, and there were business owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| and there were people who care about Burlington,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5940)|
| 1:39:02| and they had contributed to this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5942)|
| 1:39:07| and they were excited that the city was going to move forward and fund it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| It didn't happen in 2020 because we had to postpone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| and defer some of these investments because of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5953)|
| 1:39:17| We didn't know how that would hit the economy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5957)|
| 1:39:19| and I remember at the time me and other council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5959)|
| 1:39:24| and community members were very upset that we weren't able to fund it a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| So I think deferring it again would be a mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5967)|
| 1:39:33| and would undermine this community process that has been delayed before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5973)|
| 1:39:38| and it does not preclude us from continuing to work on investments in people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5978)|
| 1:39:43| investments in entrepreneurship, which are happening also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| Like I said, it's not either or, it's both and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5991)|
| 1:39:53| This is a capital improvement budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5993)|
| 1:39:56| which means it must go for capital expenditures, not programmatic expenditures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=5996)|
| 1:40:04| Am I correct in that, in that this was approved as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6004)|
| 1:40:08| it was a project within the capital improvement budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6008)|
| 1:40:13| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6013)|
| 1:40:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6014)|
| 1:40:15| I will just say I fully intend to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6015)|
| 1:40:19| I've been around a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6019)|
| 1:40:21| Burlington's been talked about for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6021)|
| 1:40:23| It's a part of the community that has felt ignored| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| when we were working on one end of Magnolia Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6026)|
| 1:40:29| This really bookends a great part of our city that has not had capital improvement dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6029)|
| 1:40:38| as often as we would have liked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| I think you can always talk to people that didn't get to participate in the public process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6042)|
| 1:40:50| somehow missed a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| but at some point, if a lot of people have invested a year and a half or more in public meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6052)|
| 1:41:00| I think we have a duty to act on what, in good faith, we told the community we would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6060)|
| 1:41:08| And again, I don't think these things are mutually exclusive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6068)|
| 1:41:12| but this is a capital budget, which means the dollars need to be spent that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6072)|
| 1:41:18| So I intend to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| Thank you, Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6080)|
| 1:41:21| Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6081)|
| 1:41:22| I'd like to hear from Deputy Gill and or Deputy Welch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6082)|
| 1:41:27| just in speaking to this and helping us clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6087)|
| 1:41:34| I'll begin because there are a couple pieces that I think maybe are clarifying kind of where we are in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| So again, this is the capital improvement program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| This is an analogous process to the budget in that this improves our ability to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6102)|
| 1:41:49| with the funding of a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| That said, we are still not to the point where we could implement a streetscape project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6111)|
| 1:41:57| because we are not yet through the design phase of these improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6117)|
| 1:42:02| And so to your point, Councilwoman Singh, about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6122)|
| 1:42:06| this one meeting that you had heard reference to where it was unclear whether businesses had been invited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6126)|
| 1:42:12| again, that was a residence association meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| That was not part of the official design phase for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6135)|
| 1:42:20| And so as that contractor for the design work gets under contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| then there will be additional public input that goes into the specific project that you all are considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| as part of the capital improvement program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6148)|
| 1:42:30| So that was just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6150)|
| 1:42:31| I wanted to make sure that you understood in terms of the phasing of these approvals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6151)|
| 1:42:37| and at what point you would see additional points come before you as council members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6157)|
| 1:42:42| both in terms of the contract for the design work and then, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6162)|
| 1:42:45| the contract to move forward with implementation of the streetscape project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6165)|
| 1:42:50| Thank you, Ms. Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6170)|
| 1:42:51| Ms. Walsh, did you have anything to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6171)|
| 1:42:54| I think that it's been covered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6174)|
| 1:42:55| We've talked about community process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6175)|
| 1:42:57| We've talked about the investments that the city makes in multiple ways in communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6177)|
| 1:43:03| and capital projects are just one of those ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6183)|
| 1:43:07| And that's what this particular document that you're being asked to approve is addressing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6187)|
| 1:43:12| There are many other agenda items, a really long agenda tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| that address many ways that we're investing in communities across Knoxville that go beyond capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6196)|
| 1:43:23| Thank you, Ms. Walsh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| Council Member Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6204)|
| 1:43:26| I have a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6206)|
| 1:43:28| But first, we have some members of the Burlington community who have arrived now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6208)|
| 1:43:35| and I don't know if they've signed up for public forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| but didn't indicate what topic they were going to speak on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6217)|
| 1:43:41| But I think at this point, especially with so much discussion about what meetings folks have been involved in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6221)|
| 1:43:49| and what discussion the community has been engaged in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6229)|
| 1:43:52| if we could hear from the Burlington community at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6232)|
| 1:43:56| There's no one signed up to speak to this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6236)|
| 1:43:59| I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| You're signed up to speak at public forum according to Mr. Johnson's record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6241)|
| 1:44:07| So public forum comes at the end, and I'll call on you to speak at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6247)|
| 1:44:12| So not many people realize that if you tell Will what agenda item you're going to speak to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6252)|
| 1:44:18| that you get to speak earlier than public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6258)|
| 1:44:21| So I don't see a reason why we would not acknowledge that what the speaker wishes to speak on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6261)|
| 1:44:27| is the agenda item we're discussing right now rather than public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6267)|
| 1:44:32| Council Member Reiner, did you have a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6272)|
| 1:44:35| Yeah, I don't mean to interrupt Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6275)|
| 1:44:38| I just want to tack on to what she just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6278)|
| 1:44:41| So are you saying that those people want to speak on this agenda item instead of public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6281)|
| 1:44:50| I personally think that would be preferable because then it's a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6290)|
| 1:44:55| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| Who do you have signed up for public forum that thought they were signing up for this agenda item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6297)|
| 1:45:02| I guess that's Ms. Deirdre Harper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6302)|
| 1:45:05| I'd like to call on Ms. Harper to give her her five minutes of time now instead of at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6305)|
| 1:45:10| That was her intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6310)|
| 1:45:15| Council Members, if you wish to do that, you have to suspend your rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6315)|
| 1:45:19| and change how you conduct the forum and how people sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| Do you want to make that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6324)|
| 1:45:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| I'll make the motion, and I just want to clarify for the public that when you – I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6326)|
| 1:45:34| I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6334)|
| 1:45:35| I guess the comment is that people think that they're calling in to speak on an agenda item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6335)|
| 1:45:40| but they sign up for public forum instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6340)|
| 1:45:44| So since Ms. Harper signed up for the wrong speaking part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| I'm making a motion to suspend the rules for her to speak to this item instead of at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6349)|
| 1:45:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6354)|
| 1:45:55| The motion made to suspend the rules to allow someone who signed up for public forum to speak to an agenda item instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6355)|
| 1:46:00| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6360)|
| 1:46:01| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6361)|
| 1:46:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6362)|
| 1:46:03| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6363)|
| 1:46:04| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6364)|
| 1:46:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6366)|
| 1:46:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6367)|
| 1:46:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6368)|
| 1:46:09| The motion to suspend the rules passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6369)|
| 1:46:11| Ms. Harper, please come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6371)|
| 1:46:12| You'll have up to five minutes to speak to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6372)|
| 1:46:16| If you could start by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6376)|
| 1:46:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6379)|
| 1:46:20| Deidre Harper, 1032 Adams Avenue, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6380)|
| 1:46:26| Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6386)|
| 1:46:31| even though I did mention to Will that I was signing up to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| So thank you so much for making the motion and passing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6395)|
| 1:46:39| I'll start with reading the email that was sent to the council members and the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6399)|
| 1:46:43| And it reads, hello, council and mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6403)|
| 1:46:45| I hope this email finds you well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| I have a concern I would like to raise regarding the Burlington Capital Improvement Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6407)|
| 1:46:51| There was a Burlington Neighborhood Association meeting last Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| and a representative from the city of Knoxville came to speak to those that were in attendance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| about $2 million being allocated for the Burlington Capital Improvement Project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6418)|
| 1:47:02| There were great questions asked and great feedback given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| However, the community members present were not in favor of the $2 million being spent on streetscapes projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6425)|
| 1:47:11| and instead wanted the funds to be used towards business development for those wishing to do business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6431)|
| 1:47:16| or start a business in the Burlington District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6436)|
| 1:47:18| It was made aware to us that the $2 million was not tied to any state or federal funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6438)|
| 1:47:23| that would mandate how funds had to be spent, therefore yielding some flexibility on how funds could be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6443)|
| 1:47:30| I am asking that a motion be made to start discussion and amend the usage of money for Burlington's Capital Improvement Project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6450)|
| 1:47:36| and to be moved from engineering to community and economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6456)|
| 1:47:40| I do plan to speak to this concern at the city council meeting on Tuesday as this will be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6460)|
| 1:47:46| I do think streetscapes are nice to have, but with the community dealing with poverty and lack of resources to grow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6466)|
| 1:47:53| investment and development are ways to address the lack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6473)|
| 1:47:56| The community is speaking and has spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6476)|
| 1:47:58| Let's put forth effort to redirect those funds and make this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6478)|
| 1:48:02| So when I came in just now, I heard some of the conversation about meetings that had been had before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6482)|
| 1:48:11| to talk about the $2 million and the streetscape projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6491)|
| 1:48:15| And I was in attendance at one of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6495)|
| 1:48:18| I don't know if there were many or multiple ones, but I was in attendance at one of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6498)|
| 1:48:23| And from there, the community, to my knowledge, was even saying, well, who said we wanted streetscape projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6503)|
| 1:48:32| You know, that was just what was presented to us and what we had to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6512)|
| 1:48:36| There was no other option to say, hey, do you want business or economic development or do you want streetscapes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6516)|
| 1:48:43| So, yes, it is true that there was a meeting that was had and community members did talk about the concern for streetscapes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6523)|
| 1:48:51| but that was the only option at the time that was given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| We voted on park benches, streetscapes, street lights, trash cans and things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6534)|
| 1:49:01| But even then, the concern from the community that I heard as well was like, well, streetscapes are nice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6541)|
| 1:49:07| but we would like business and economic development in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6547)|
| 1:49:13| Mayor, I know you mentioned it was a both and, but many times it does not feel like a both and.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6553)|
| 1:49:19| It kind of feels like an either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| And this, to me, is feeling like an either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| Either you're getting streetscapes or you're getting business development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6563)|
| 1:49:28| And the reason why the email was sent is because due to it not being tied to any federal or state funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6568)|
| 1:49:34| so understanding that this is a capital improvement project that we are discussing at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6574)|
| 1:49:39| but if there's no ties to how the money has to be used, that was the reason for the email to send to say, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6579)|
| 1:49:46| well, why can't we redirect those funds since there's no tie to the money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6586)|
| 1:49:51| And maybe you all can speak to that and educate me in that space if there is a reason or if there's a purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6591)|
| 1:49:57| like, hey, money came from here, it has to be spent on this particular project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6597)|
| 1:50:02| or if money just came in and that's where the city chose to put the money at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6602)|
| 1:50:06| So I think that is a concern that we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6606)|
| 1:50:08| Like, money is coming in, but we're not particularly in favor at the moment for streetscape projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6608)|
| 1:50:15| And those at the meeting that were there definitely was vocal about how can we redirect those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6615)|
| 1:50:22| and put it into the community and development line items so that we can get businesses who want to do business in Burlington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6622)|
| 1:50:31| and or who are already doing business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6631)|
| 1:50:34| Because a lot of times we see in our community is we beautify and we make it nice and then people come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6634)|
| 1:50:39| but we're not the ones that get to take advantage of the nice spaces that are created by these type of capital improvement projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6639)|
| 1:50:47| So thank you for your time and thank you for giving me the chance to speak specifically to this particular line item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6647)|
| 1:50:53| Thank you, Ms. Harper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6653)|
| 1:50:56| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6656)|
| 1:51:01| First off, well, okay, my microphone is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6661)|
| 1:51:03| I broke it a moment ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6663)|
| 1:51:07| So we've discussed some of the points as a response to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6667)|
| 1:51:12| In what programs has the city funded microloans or business loans in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6672)|
| 1:51:22| Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6682)|
| 1:51:24| Yes, thank you, Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6684)|
| 1:51:27| So the city invests in business and economic development in multiple ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6687)|
| 1:51:32| We do not directly fund loans to businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6692)|
| 1:51:37| That's not, and our law director can speak to the legal rationale for why as a city we do not loan funds directly to businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6697)|
| 1:51:50| There are other ways that we invest in economic development in partnership with organizations such as the Knoxville Entrepreneur's Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6710)|
| 1:52:01| the 100 Knoxville Initiative, the Chamber and their Path to Prosperity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6721)|
| 1:52:06| which is exploring lots of options for providing access to capital, assistance for workforce development, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6726)|
| 1:52:16| through the Knoxville Area Urban League, through Centro Hispano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6736)|
| 1:52:20| So through partnership with organizations that are doing community work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6740)|
| 1:52:25| we're investing in the kinds of economic development strategies that help small business, minority-owned businesses, local businesses to thrive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6745)|
| 1:52:37| This is part of sort of a three-pronged strategy that we've seen, and you've seen it, Council Member Ryder, in your district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6757)|
| 1:52:45| for example, with a combination of community engagement and community process, infrastructure improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6765)|
| 1:52:54| and partnership with agencies and organizations that work with businesses to help with business planning, mentorship, access to capital, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6774)|
| 1:53:07| So I don't know if that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6790)|
| 1:53:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6791)|
| 1:53:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| Mr. Swanson, could you comment on the legality of why we don't do business loans from city funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6794)|
| 1:53:24| Because the state constitution, Article II, Section 31, prohibits a state or any of its legal subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6804)|
| 1:53:34| from extending its credit to private entities except under certain limited circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6814)|
| 1:53:41| We don't know whether those circumstances apply here or not because we don't know the specific proposal for those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6821)|
| 1:53:49| So if it were just a proposal to take X number of city dollars and give it to certain businesses to enhance their business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6829)|
| 1:54:01| that would be a violation of the state constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6844)|
| 1:54:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6845)|
| 1:54:06| And then one last question before I'll turn my light off at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6846)|
| 1:54:11| The Capital Improvement Project budget is approved through Planning Commission, correct, before it comes to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6851)|
| 1:54:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6858)|
| 1:54:19| I just think that's important because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6859)|
| 1:54:23| when people start talking about making amendments or changing it, it has to be by ordinance or charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6863)|
| 1:54:28| It goes through the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6868)|
| 1:54:30| Yeah, and by charter also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6870)|
| 1:54:32| Mr. Swanson, could you just read the charter excerpt about the timing of this vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6872)|
| 1:54:38| Well, for the capital improvement budget, the charter, Section 901, subsection J, says that capital improvements budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6878)|
| 1:54:48| a capital improvements budget shall be prepared and submitted to the council each year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6888)|
| 1:54:53| 60 days prior to the commencement of the next ensuing fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6893)|
| 1:54:58| The council shall adopt a capital improvements budget no later than 15 days prior to the commencement of the next ensuing fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6898)|
| 1:55:07| And we're there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6907)|
| 1:55:11| Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6911)|
| 1:55:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6913)|
| 1:55:14| Just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6914)|
| 1:55:16| Back in 2019, when there were the public meetings and there was the charades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6916)|
| 1:55:22| and I think that was under the leadership at the time of the Burlington Residence Association of Daisha Lundy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6922)|
| 1:55:29| who helped lead this effort with the East Tennessee Design Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6929)|
| 1:55:33| is it a correct statement to say that there was no actual dollar amount that was placed on the capital improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6933)|
| 1:55:39| and infrastructure at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6939)|
| 1:55:42| Ms. Gill, you look like you have a firm answer on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6945)|
| 1:55:46| Yes, I, in fact, reviewed that 2019 Burlington Enhancement Plan this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6946)|
| 1:55:52| and confirmed that at that point, no, in terms of the vision and some of the specific improvements that were listed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6952)|
| 1:56:00| and identified by the community at that point, there was no cost associated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6960)|
| 1:56:03| It was a vision plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| And so, again, our intention in funding Burlington, both in this upcoming fiscal year as well as in previous fiscal years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6965)|
| 1:56:12| has been to move that vision from concepts into reality, and that begins with design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6972)|
| 1:56:17| which we are implementing this fiscal year, and then, of course, we'll continue with implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6977)|
| 1:56:21| as we hopefully move into the next fiscal year with this capital project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6981)|
| 1:56:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6984)|
| 1:56:25| Then the next question would be just for those in the audience and those who are listening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6985)|
| 1:56:30| I think that it may have been stated earlier, if these dollars are not used for this particular purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6990)|
| 1:56:36| they would go back into the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6996)|
| 1:56:38| They cannot be reassigned at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=6998)|
| 1:56:41| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7001)|
| 1:56:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7002)|
| 1:56:43| So the points that were made as far as assistance and with development of businesses and business opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7003)|
| 1:56:51| that's a separate conversation that would need to be had as it relates to investments that we, the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7011)|
| 1:56:57| make in organizations that support those types of things, as mentioned, the Urban League and other organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7017)|
| 1:57:05| I do want to ask Mr. Lomax again to please follow back up with me regarding the meeting that was had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7025)|
| 1:57:12| if it was actually a meeting that the Office of Neighborhoods called in Burlington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7032)|
| 1:57:16| or if it was a Burlington Neighborhood Association meeting because there are several homeowners in Burlington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7036)|
| 1:57:22| that unfortunately are not aware that the organization is still functioning or maybe meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7042)|
| 1:57:28| That could be because of COVID, but I've heard several of those comments here recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7048)|
| 1:57:33| So I am in favor of moving forward based on the high response rate that we've seen in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7053)|
| 1:57:39| and engagement in the past, and then also trying to help make sure that when there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7059)|
| 1:57:46| Burlington Neighborhood Association meetings that the entire neighborhood is involved, engaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7066)|
| 1:57:51| and aware of those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7071)|
| 1:57:53| I would not be in favor of moving or stopping these dollars without the same level of engagement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7073)|
| 1:58:00| that we saw in 2019 and subsequent to that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7080)|
| 1:58:04| So I will be in favor of moving this forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7084)|
| 1:58:06| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie. Dr. Lomax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7086)|
| 1:58:09| If I may respond, thank you very much, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7089)|
| 1:58:12| This particular meeting that was held last week was called by Debbie Sharp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7092)|
| 1:58:17| who is our neighborhood coordinator, and she called that meeting to meet with the president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7097)|
| 1:58:24| and leadership of the Burlington Residents Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7104)|
| 1:58:27| So that was not a regular scheduled meeting of that group, and so the purpose of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7107)|
| 1:58:34| from my understanding, was to give an update as far as what was going on from our end of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7114)|
| 1:58:42| so that she and those present would have an understanding of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7122)|
| 1:58:48| From my understanding, there were approximately 10 to 15 individuals that were present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7128)|
| 1:58:54| at that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7134)|
| 1:58:57| And at that point, as was shared by Ms. Harper, discussion was had regarding that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7137)|
| 1:59:03| questions asked and given just in response to the upcoming agenda item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7143)|
| 1:59:10| and what's going on in Burlington and keeping them informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7154)|
| 1:59:15| And with that said, it's probably fair to say that it's new leadership from 2019| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7155)|
| 1:59:21| when Desha Lundy was the president of the organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7161)|
| 1:59:26| so that may have been that some of the members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7166)|
| 1:59:29| and again I don't know who the leadership is at this point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| may not have been as engaged on the front end potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7172)|
| 1:59:35| so this information may have come to them and they were not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7175)|
| 1:59:40| not everyone there may have been as up to speed on what the initial plans were moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7180)|
| 1:59:46| And now with this dollar amount that's attached to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7186)|
| 1:59:49| it could have been a little, you know, people could think of it and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7189)|
| 1:59:53| well, hey, we would rather see something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| not really understanding the scope that these dollars are attached just for this project alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7195)|
| 1:59:59| So not being at the meeting, I'm not sure how it was conveyed by Ms. Sharpe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7199)|
| 2:00:04| but again, we've been talking about this for a couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7204)|
| 2:00:10| and so I think that, again, I'll support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7210)|
| 2:00:13| Thank you, Vice Mayor McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7213)|
| 2:00:15| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7215)|
| 2:00:18| I have a few questions and a few comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7218)|
| 2:00:22| One, just following up on what Vice Mayor McKenzie said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7222)|
| 2:00:32| I'm trying to understand why money would not be able to be transferred in the capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7232)|
| 2:00:38| and would have to go back to the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| Can you help me understand that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7240)|
| 2:00:42| I believe it's the way the ordinances around budgeting are written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7242)|
| 2:00:47| I need more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7247)|
| 2:00:49| Because this is the capital improvement budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7249)|
| 2:00:52| You've already funded the operating budget, and this is the capital improvement budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7252)|
| 2:00:58| So it deals only with capital improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7258)|
| 2:01:02| So you can amend this budget by deleting from this budget the Burlington project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7262)|
| 2:01:09| but those funds will then, you can't decide how to spend those funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7269)|
| 2:01:14| just like you can't with the regular operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7274)|
| 2:01:17| Okay, but the administration can transfer those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7277)|
| 2:01:22| City Council may not be able to make a motion to transfer those funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| but the mayor can transfer those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7286)|
| 2:01:29| Actually, you can make the appropriate motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7289)|
| 2:01:32| but what you would have to do is you would have to delete this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7292)|
| 2:01:36| from the capital improvement budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7296)|
| 2:01:39| The money would then go into the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7299)|
| 2:01:42| and then you could sponsor an ordinance seeking the council's approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7302)|
| 2:01:50| of utilizing X amount of dollars for some particular project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7310)|
| 2:01:58| Okay, but what the community wants is simply to revert back to the plan in place last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7318)|
| 2:02:06| which was that there was money for Burlington under community economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7326)|
| 2:02:12| This year when the capital plan was presented to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7332)|
| 2:02:16| money was moved from community economic development to the engineering budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7336)|
| 2:02:22| I'm very confused why the money cannot be moved back to community and economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7342)|
| 2:02:28| Ms. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| Just to clarify, Councilwoman Parker, under the previous administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7350)|
| 2:02:36| and this is something that has changed in the way that we operate in partnership across departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7356)|
| 2:02:42| the department of, I think it was actually policy at the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7362)|
| 2:02:48| which included economic development housed dollars for engineering projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7368)|
| 2:02:55| Those Burlington dollars were for capital projects that were happening in Burlington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7375)|
| 2:03:01| There were other line items in the economic development budget that were for engineering projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7381)|
| 2:03:08| and so we made a decision in partnership with engineering to make sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7388)|
| 2:03:14| if there were dollars in our budget that were for engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7394)|
| 2:03:17| and they were being managed by engineering, then they would be in the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7397)|
| 2:03:23| So those dollars, because we see the economic development impact of engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7403)|
| 2:03:30| I mean, those dollars have an economic development impact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7410)|
| 2:03:36| but they were going for engineering projects, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7416)|
| 2:03:40| Okay, so additional questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7420)|
| 2:03:47| One vehicle a city can turn to in order to spur economic development is through a development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7427)|
| 2:04:01| The city might not be able to make those investments directly, but can do so through a development corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7441)|
| 2:04:07| I'm trying to understand what's currently happening with our development corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7447)|
| 2:04:12| and why that would not be a tool that is used to increase access to capital for businesses in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7452)|
| 2:04:23| Also, especially businesses in our community located in neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7463)|
| 2:04:31| that have experienced historical underinvestment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7471)|
| 2:04:37| How are we using our development corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| and why can that not be a tool that is used to help with economic development in the Burlington community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7479)|
| 2:04:47| You're asking about KCDC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| Either KCDC or the assets that have just been transferred to the Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7490)|
| 2:05:00| I believe you had a role to play in that decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7500)|
| 2:05:05| What I'm trying to understand is how is the city using the tools, the agencies, the institutions available to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7505)|
| 2:05:12| and why can those not be used for Burlington?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7512)|
| 2:05:15| Well, the good news is that they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7515)|
| 2:05:17| They are being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7517)|
| 2:05:18| We are working with the Chamber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7518)|
| 2:05:21| We contribute to their budget so they can do these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7521)|
| 2:05:26| They have the Path to Prosperity, which I'm sure you've attended some of those meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| where they solicited input from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7531)|
| 2:05:33| They even had a session at Honey Rock Church in the Burlington community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7533)|
| 2:05:39| so they got input from the community at least at multiple occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7539)|
| 2:05:45| And then they've now developed a plan, and they're working on implementing that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7545)|
| 2:05:49| Some of that plan is workforce development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7549)|
| 2:05:51| Some of that plan is access to capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7551)|
| 2:05:54| Some of that is business mentorship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7554)|
| 2:05:57| It's pretty comprehensive, and I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7557)|
| 2:06:00| I think it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7560)|
| 2:06:02| I think it's particularly focused more than ever before on parts of our city that have not seen as much investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7562)|
| 2:06:09| and it is focused on investing in people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7569)|
| 2:06:11| And they have a lot of expertise in this, and they have a lot of capacity to help the city with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7571)|
| 2:06:17| and that's why we're asking them as our partner to work on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7577)|
| 2:06:23| So, yeah, that's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7583)|
| 2:06:25| And KCDC, I'm not sure what their role would be in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7585)|
| 2:06:28| I'm going to ask Ms. Welch to sort of try to address that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7588)|
| 2:06:34| So, sorry, because I missed part of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7594)|
| 2:06:38| I was trying to follow the connection with the capital budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7598)|
| 2:06:41| But I think this conversation about how we work with partners to address economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7601)|
| 2:06:49| is something that we could expand on in a council dinner or a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7609)|
| 2:06:54| I definitely see how it's related to the capital budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7614)|
| 2:06:59| but I think we could have a very expansive conversation about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7619)|
| 2:07:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7626)|
| 2:07:07| I think it's pretty clear that we need to do streetscapes, infrastructure improvements, and maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7627)|
| 2:07:12| and the economic development piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7632)|
| 2:07:14| As I said before, it's both and, not either or.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7634)|
| 2:07:17| Right, and that was the hope of the community when the money was located under community and economic development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7637)|
| 2:07:22| Once the money is located exclusively under engineering, that gives the community no options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7642)|
| 2:07:27| They know only streetscapes is coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7647)|
| 2:07:30| And the reason for my questions before was that it's frustrating that we were having a conversation about what the city cannot do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7650)|
| 2:07:39| when actually we have tools in place to expand what the city can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7659)|
| 2:07:43| We just have to use those tools to benefit the communities in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7663)|
| 2:07:48| A couple of things I wanted to raise up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7668)|
| 2:07:52| I've been a part of these conversations for the last several years myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7672)|
| 2:07:56| and attended the meetings held by the design center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7676)|
| 2:08:04| And folks are certainly excited about a planning process and the potential for investment in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7684)|
| 2:08:11| But I wouldn't say they were excited about the final design plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7691)|
| 2:08:15| There were multiple property owners that I talked to who said that the design plans absolutely did not work for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7695)|
| 2:08:26| And so I'm concerned about a number being put beside the streetscapes project of 2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7706)|
| 2:08:39| with plans to move forward on that when it doesn't seem, from my perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7719)|
| 2:08:45| that the community was in agreement with the final plans that were developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7725)|
| 2:08:51| And then...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7731)|
| 2:08:56| Oh, and the last question I just had was the community wants to know what happened to the $600,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7736)|
| 2:09:02| that was in the capital budget for Burlington from last year's capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7742)|
| 2:09:09| I think it was about $636,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7749)|
| 2:09:15| Ms. Gill or Mr. Cannon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7755)|
| 2:09:18| Let me take a stab at it and, Director Cannon, if you can fill in some additional perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7758)|
| 2:09:24| So, first of all, Councilwoman Parker, what I do want to clarify is, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7764)|
| 2:09:29| what the Burlington Enhancement Plan does in the first four pages of it, printed version,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7769)|
| 2:09:35| recommend, again, some very broad categories of the types of improvements that we are dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7775)|
| 2:09:41| when it comes to the public realm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7781)|
| 2:09:43| And so, in particular, the places where the city infrastructure improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7783)|
| 2:09:47| in a number of our redevelopment nodes go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| So we're thinking about things like crosswalks, pedestrian access, street amenities, streetscape improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7789)|
| 2:09:56| but, again, the city historically funds in these redevelopment nodes and have funded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7796)|
| 2:10:01| as Deputy Welch mentioned, and other particular projects that used to be under the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7801)|
| 2:10:07| and redevelopment arm under Dr. Bill Lyons, for example, Cumberland Central, South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7807)|
| 2:10:15| The other piece of this is, to your point about the $600,000, that money is still there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7815)|
| 2:10:19| so capital project funding, we'll use a colloquial term, rolls over year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7819)|
| 2:10:25| And so, again, that $600,000 was available to the engineering department in this fiscal year budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7825)|
| 2:10:30| and allowed them to move forward with procurement of design services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7830)|
| 2:10:34| And at this point, I'll turn it over to Director Keenan to pick up where I left off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7834)|
| 2:10:39| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7839)|
| 2:10:41| I think there's a misunderstanding that this was thrown on the community all at once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7841)|
| 2:10:46| And Dr. Lomax has been very intentional for that not to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7846)|
| 2:10:52| There was a discussion with the community the latter part of last summer, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7852)|
| 2:10:56| regarding a design contract that we were going to be seeking requests for qualifications on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7856)|
| 2:11:04| One of the points that the community made very clear to Dr. Lomax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7864)|
| 2:11:08| and it was incorporated in the RFQ, is that there must be an urban planner involved in this design process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7868)|
| 2:11:16| And that's what went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7876)|
| 2:11:19| To make sure to hold us accountable, if you will, to the engineering department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7879)|
| 2:11:23| Dr. Lomax was on the selection team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7883)|
| 2:11:26| He saw each submittal that was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7886)|
| 2:11:29| We also made a commitment to the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| and I think we have proved this in other projects in the past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| that this is not just going to be a design and here you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7894)|
| 2:11:38| There will be community involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7898)|
| 2:11:40| Yes, we're going to take the East Tennessee Design Center work that they developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7900)|
| 2:11:44| in cooperation with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7904)|
| 2:11:46| It was a team effort that will be used as a foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7906)|
| 2:11:51| And we picked a segment, if you will, the segment that this first phase will be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7911)|
| 2:11:57| We came up with a $2 million number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7917)|
| 2:12:00| And I will tell you that for us to do that within the $2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7920)|
| 2:12:04| based on other streetscape projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| KUB has graciously said that they will partner in some form or fashion related to utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7926)|
| 2:12:14| This is something that we all want to see done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7934)|
| 2:12:17| We all want to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7937)|
| 2:12:19| And Dr. Lomax has been the quarterback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7939)|
| 2:12:21| wanting to see this study go from study and nice drawings to a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7941)|
| 2:12:27| I may be out of bounds of what I'm saying next because it's not technically engineering,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7947)|
| 2:12:32| but it's technically my story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7952)|
| 2:12:35| And that is what this project will do is set the stage, potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7955)|
| 2:12:42| for future state and federal dollars coming into this community in many different forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7962)|
| 2:12:49| I've been blessed to be a part of the grant process for a number of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7969)|
| 2:12:53| and I learned it under my dad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7973)|
| 2:12:55| And when the federal government sees that the city is investing in a specific community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7975)|
| 2:13:02| with 100% of their dollars, that gets their attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7982)|
| 2:13:06| That is also something Dr. Lomax and I have talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7986)|
| 2:13:10| is that that raises our opportunities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7990)|
| 2:13:12| and it may raise the opportunities for federal participation in these businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7992)|
| 2:13:17| That is our hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7997)|
| 2:13:19| And given the Biden administration's known heart for these communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=7999)|
| 2:13:23| I think our opportunities are that much greater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8003)|
| 2:13:26| There's no guarantee, no guarantee at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8006)|
| 2:13:31| The foundation is we're fulfilling what the community has charged us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8011)|
| 2:13:35| through those past studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8015)|
| 2:13:37| But I would respectfully offer, again, not an engineering comment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8017)|
| 2:13:40| that this raises our opportunity to do more there with future grant dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8020)|
| 2:13:48| And my notion is that those dollars, my hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| is that we'll be having discussion about those kind of dollars in the very near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8031)|
| 2:13:56| Thank you, Mr. Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8036)|
| 2:13:57| Ms. Parker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8037)|
| 2:13:59| I'm glad that you mentioned the urban planner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8039)|
| 2:14:02| Could you give us an update on the status of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8042)|
| 2:14:06| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8046)|
| 2:14:07| The firm of Vaughan & Melton has been selected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8047)|
| 2:14:09| We had initial meetings last week with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8049)|
| 2:14:13| There is an urban planner on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8053)|
| 2:14:15| Forgive me, I do not know the entire team makeup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8055)|
| 2:14:20| I was not on the selection committee, very intentionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8060)|
| 2:14:24| but there is an urban planning element that is involved in this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8064)|
| 2:14:28| Dr. Lomax, I believe, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8068)|
| 2:14:31| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8071)|
| 2:14:32| We met last week, Sean Fitzpatrick from the engineering team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8072)|
| 2:14:36| and I met with representatives from Vaughan & Melton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8076)|
| 2:14:39| and we looked at and discussed what that work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8079)|
| 2:14:43| and community outreach might continue to look like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8083)|
| 2:14:45| and they're going to be reaching out on their end as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8085)|
| 2:14:48| to engage with community as we go forward with future projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8088)|
| 2:14:53| Let me add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8093)|
| 2:14:54| Forgive me for interrupting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8094)|
| 2:14:57| That's a commitment our department is about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8097)|
| 2:15:00| is that we are going to have community interaction on our projects of this nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8100)|
| 2:15:06| We've said it on Washington Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8106)|
| 2:15:07| There was doubts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8107)|
| 2:15:08| We've done it, and we will continue to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8108)|
| 2:15:11| And you have my word that that is exactly what is going to continue on the Burlington project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8111)|
| 2:15:16| I want that project right for our city and for that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8116)|
| 2:15:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8121)|
| 2:15:22| Director Cannon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8122)|
| 2:15:23| Another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8123)|
| 2:15:26| I'm imagining, but was the neighborhood involved at all in the selection process of that urban planner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8126)|
| 2:15:32| Because I know they had very specific asks when it came to who they wanted to work with in the Burlington community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8132)|
| 2:15:43| We included Dr. Lomax because of his interaction with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8143)|
| 2:15:47| When you have that many people involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8147)|
| 2:15:50| trying to pick the person to represent the community spot on is difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8150)|
| 2:15:56| and so that is why Dr. Lomax was in that selection process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8156)|
| 2:16:00| because of his and his staff's intimate involvement in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8160)|
| 2:16:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8166)|
| 2:16:07| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8167)|
| 2:16:08| Ms. Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8168)|
| 2:16:09| Another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8169)|
| 2:16:14| Is there a second for the call for the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8174)|
| 2:16:16| I second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8176)|
| 2:16:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8177)|

| 2:17:44| I will second her amendment to the motion to have this be an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8264)|
| 2:17:48| Okay, we have an amendment on the floor to read this as an emergency item, meaning it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8268)|
| 2:17:53| would just be passed in one reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8273)|

| 2:18:14| Motion carried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8294)|
| 2:18:15| Oh, you're opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8295)|
| 2:18:18| 12F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8298)|
| 2:18:27| Okay, I'll take that as a yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8307)|
| 2:18:29| And I'll say the reason I was confused is because I thought there was a realization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8309)|
| 2:18:32| that if we didn't pass the capital budget on emergency today, then we were not in alignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8312)|
| 2:18:38| with the requirements of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8318)|
| 2:18:42| No, it doesn't say it has to be finally adopted by the 15th day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8322)|
| 2:18:48| It says it has to be adopted, so it has been now adopted on the first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8328)|
| 2:18:53| So an argument could be made that it needs to be finally adopted, but it doesn't say so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8333)|
| 2:18:59| And so I would not conclude that it has to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8339)|
| 2:19:03| Okay, the item 12F passes unanimously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8343)|

| 2:20:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8453)|
| 2:20:54| I would like to hear from them first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8454)|
| 2:20:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8458)|
| 2:20:59| First person signed up to speak to this item is Mr. Benjamin Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8459)|
| 2:21:03| Mr. Mullins, you're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8463)|

| 2:21:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8468)|
| 2:21:09| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street, Suite 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8469)|
| 2:21:12| This was my application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8472)|
| 2:21:14| The reason I'm signed up against it is that our application was actually for the RN4 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8474)|
| 2:21:20| not the RN2 zoning that the Planning Commission narrowly recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8480)|
| 2:21:27| They did vote 8-5 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8487)|
| 2:21:30| Before they approved staff's recommendation, they voted 7-6 to deny my application for RN4 zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8490)|
| 2:21:38| Mr. Welch, he's the property owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8498)|
| 2:21:40| He's also here and signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8500)|
| 2:21:42| This is essentially a prior zoning equivalent request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8502)|
| 2:21:47| Mr. Welch filed his application in September of 2020 because during the recode process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8507)|
| 2:21:54| this property, these two parcels were previously zoned R2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8514)|
| 2:21:58| which allowed for the consideration of multifamily property to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8518)|
| 2:22:03| In fact, he does have on the 2910 property an existing multifamily development there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8523)|
| 2:22:10| and he was hoping to be able to expand that not just on that property but on the adjacent parcels as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8530)|
| 2:22:16| In fact, I think he's already done some grading potentially in anticipation of further developing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8536)|
| 2:22:23| When he went to the planning staff, they told him the equivalency was RN5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8543)|
| 2:22:27| They did not allow RN4 to be considered a prior zoning equivalency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8547)|
| 2:22:32| RN5 zoning in this area, because the sector plan is medium-density residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8552)|
| 2:22:36| would require a sector plan and a one-year plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8556)|
| 2:22:39| He did not realize that until staff's recommendation came down saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8559)|
| 2:22:43| you're going to have to also amend the sector plan for the RN5 zoning that you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8563)|
| 2:22:48| So at that time, we postponed the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8568)|
| 2:22:51| We worked with, talked to staff about doing an RN4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8571)|
| 2:22:56| but they made us withdraw our application and refile it because they didn't consider that to be a prior zoning equivalency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8576)|
| 2:23:02| which is why it had the March 2021 zoning number for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8582)|
| 2:23:14| You know, we talked about this property being in a housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8594)|
| 2:23:17| We talked to this county, this city, in a housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8597)|
| 2:23:21| This property is two miles away from the new Amazon Center going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8601)|
| 2:23:24| It's on Greenway Drive, which has a 40-foot right-of-way, and I think it's a major collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8604)|
| 2:23:32| The property has been used for multifamily since 1994, at least part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8612)|
| 2:23:38| And while it's true it would be grandfathered, it would be a preexisting nonconforming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8618)|
| 2:23:42| he would have to go through the Board of Zoning Appeals if he wanted to expand that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8622)|
| 2:23:47| and he could not do that on his other parcel because these are two separate parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8627)|
| 2:23:51| These parcels are a little bit unique in that they're very long and narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8631)|
| 2:23:55| and they're bisected with a floodway and also some hillside protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8635)|
| 2:24:02| So the only usable portions of the property are at the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8642)|
| 2:24:06| There's never, throughout this entire process, never been any public opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8646)|
| 2:24:11| And the zoning that we're asking for is completely consistent with the existing sector plan and one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8651)|
| 2:24:19| So I know when there was a lot of debate with RECODE, I know Mr. Green talked about the transition rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8659)|
| 2:24:28| that if your property is zoned in a manner in which you can no longer use it the way that you could before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8668)|
| 2:24:34| they would have the opportunity to make this request, and that's what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8674)|
| 2:24:39| And I think in this case, Mr. Welch is not some out-of-state developer trying to tinker with the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8679)|
| 2:24:46| He's been invested in this community and with this property for quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8686)|
| 2:24:51| It was originally zoned to R2 in, I believe, 1984.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8691)|
| 2:24:57| So he's investing in his own backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8697)|
| 2:25:01| And I think as a policy for this city council, we need to make considerations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8701)|
| 2:25:07| to allow people to continue to do what they could do before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8707)|
| 2:25:10| Just because he didn't develop all of his property as multifamily before the zoning changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8710)|
| 2:25:15| we shouldn't penalize him now for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8715)|
| 2:25:20| You know, there is a variety of uses in this area that are in the immediate walkable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8720)|
| 2:25:25| There's a church right next to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8725)|
| 2:25:28| There's R in 3 zoning, about 9 acres, about 1,400 feet from this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8728)|
| 2:25:35| I mean, this area is starting to change. It is starting to grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8735)|
| 2:25:38| And I think we're going to see more of a need for housing along this stretch of the city in Greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8738)|
| 2:25:46| especially considering some of the jobs that are moving in just a couple of miles down the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8746)|
| 2:25:50| So we would ask respectfully that this council overturn Planning Commission's narrow recommendation for R2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8750)|
| 2:25:58| and approve the R in 4 to allow Mr. Welch to continue to use his property as he could before we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8758)|
| 2:26:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8764)|
| 2:26:05| Thank you, Mr. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8765)|
| 2:26:07| The next person signed up to speak is Mr. Ron Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8767)|
| 2:26:09| Mr. Welch, if you could just state your name and address for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8769)|
| 2:26:13| Ron Welch, 2615 Greenway Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8773)|
| 2:26:16| Hard to follow up past that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8776)|
| 2:26:18| He has spoken about that thing very eloquently for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8778)|
| 2:26:21| I've had that property there for, gosh, 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8781)|
| 2:26:24| I've got started on developing on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8784)|
| 2:26:26| I would like to expand on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8786)|
| 2:26:28| And, again, I offer affordable housing in that area for workers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8788)|
| 2:26:31| And I just ask for y'all to help me get that changed back to where I can expand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8791)|
| 2:26:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8795)|
| 2:26:36| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8796)|
| 2:26:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8799)|
| 2:26:40| Thank you, Mr. Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8800)|
| 2:26:41| That concludes the public speakers who signed up to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8801)|
| 2:26:44| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8804)|
| 2:26:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8806)|
| 2:26:47| So I wanted to say first thank you to Ms. Brooks and the Planning Commission staff for allowing me to send it back for reconsideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8807)|
| 2:26:58| and for many conversations that we had with her and Ms. Cordier about the logic behind the zoning and the changes in the recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8818)|
| 2:27:09| I've gone out to visit the property multiple times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8829)|
| 2:27:13| I'm pretty partial to prior zoning equivalents if that's a big commitment that we made in the recode process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8833)|
| 2:27:23| And so I have a hard time saying no to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8843)|
| 2:27:27| If it was something that was detrimental and there was community opposition to, I wouldn't, you know, be so considerate of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8847)|
| 2:27:37| But this property was zoned that way since the 80s, and it got changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8857)|
| 2:27:43| I did listen to both times this was heard at the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8863)|
| 2:27:49| And in the last conversation, and it did get voted again, the RN-4 was discussed and failed 7-6, and then the motion was made to go with staff opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8869)|
| 2:28:02| As Mr. Mullins stated, that passed 8-5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8882)|
| 2:28:05| Some people changed their vote to support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8885)|
| 2:28:09| When I visit the area out there and I look at the zoning map, there's a considerable area of RN-3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8889)|
| 2:28:17| There's a large amount of industrial, mixed-use and industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8897)|
| 2:28:22| There was discussion about spot zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8902)|
| 2:28:24| But I think one of the biggest parcels that directly abuts Mr. Welch's property is actually a school and a church, and it directly adjoins it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8904)|
| 2:28:33| And so when I look at it, I don't think we can just look at it as RN-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8913)|
| 2:28:39| That's not the use of that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8919)|
| 2:28:41| And because the request enables more housing in an area that could support it, it abuts the interstate and a floodway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8921)|
| 2:28:49| There's just a variety of factors in going out and visiting the area and driving around the neighborhood and looking at the abutting properties, uses, and the array of zoning there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8929)|
| 2:29:00| I support the prior zoning equivalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8940)|
| 2:29:07| I'm going to make two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8947)|
| 2:29:11| The first motion, I have to be able to do the RN-4 because what we have to vote here on is RN-2, what was passed by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8951)|
| 2:29:22| I'm going to make the motion to pass that and then have to make an amended motion to pass RN-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8962)|
| 2:29:30| I'd like to make a motion to pass the RN-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8970)|
| 2:29:33| Okay, motion made to approve it as captioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8973)|
| 2:29:36| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8976)|
| 2:29:37| And a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8977)|
| 2:29:39| And then I'd like to make an amended motion to amend the RN-2 to RN-4 as discussed at the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8979)|
| 2:29:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8989)|
| 2:29:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8990)|
| 2:29:51| The amendment on the floor is to change the item from RN-2 to RN-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8991)|
| 2:29:57| Any questions or discussion on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=8997)|
| 2:30:01| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9001)|
| 2:30:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9003)|
| 2:30:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9004)|
| 2:30:05| The amendment passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9005)|
| 2:30:06| Now we're back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9006)|
| 2:30:08| Are there any questions or discussion on the amended motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9008)|
| 2:30:12| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9012)|
| 2:30:13| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9013)|
| 2:30:15| I have been having this conversation with a lot of people who still have issues with recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9015)|
| 2:30:24| And, you know, it's a living document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9024)|
| 2:30:27| But I think I'm wondering if we need to look again at extending the period from 2020 into 2021| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9027)|
| 2:30:35| where people can go for the prior code equivalent without paying fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9035)|
| 2:30:42| So that's more a conversation for later, maybe for one of our dinners, but I wanted to bring it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9042)|
| 2:30:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9048)|
| 2:30:50| Any other questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9050)|
| 2:30:52| Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9052)|
| 2:30:53| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9053)|
| 2:30:55| There was a motion about there was two votes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9055)|
| 2:30:57| And what was the first vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9057)|
| 2:30:59| On the Planning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9059)|
| 2:31:00| No, the first vote that was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9060)|
| 2:31:02| Well, the first vote approves a motion as captioned on RN-2 and then an amendment from RN-2 to RN-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9062)|
| 2:31:12| And both of those have been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9072)|
| 2:31:15| So now we're back on the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9075)|
| 2:31:19| What you'd be voting on next when the debate has ended is RN-4, up or down on RN-4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9079)|
| 2:31:26| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9086)|
| 2:31:27| Thank you for clarifying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9087)|
| 2:31:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9089)|
| 2:31:30| Any further questions on the motion before us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9090)|
| 2:31:34| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9094)|
| 2:31:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9096)|
| 2:31:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9097)|
| 2:31:38| Mayor, I'm going to abstain on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9098)|
| 2:31:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9100)|
| 2:31:41| Motion carries 8-0 with one abstention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9101)|
| 2:31:50| 12L is an ordinance to amend Ordinance No. 0-107-2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-210615?start=9110)|
