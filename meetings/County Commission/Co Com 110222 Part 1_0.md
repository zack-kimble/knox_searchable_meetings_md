| 0:00:00| I'd like to, pardon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=0)|
| 0:00:04| Yes, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=4)|
| 0:00:05| I just want to make a suggestion that instead of stopping this discussion, because I have a feeling it's going to go past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=5)|
| 0:00:10| five o'clock, that we go ahead and move to that room so that we don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=10)|
| 0:00:15| Let me see if it's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=15)|
| 0:00:16| I mean, if it's available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=16)|
| 0:00:17| There's also some discussion, Mr. Chairman, that the city council is not actually starting beer board till six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=17)|
| 0:00:28| Mr. Chairman, I don't know if there's something I don't know about, but having served on council for years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=28)|
| 0:00:33| the second council meeting of every month, beer board starts at six and then council starts at seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=33)|
| 0:00:38| That is standard schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=38)|
| 0:00:40| So I think they just wanted some buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=40)|
| 0:00:43| They had told us we needed to be out of this room, vacate around five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=43)|
| 0:00:46| Yeah, they wanted some buffer time, but I don't think you have to be out at five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=46)|
| 0:00:49| I don't think you want to be here at six, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=49)|
| 0:00:51| Can we be out at 530?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=51)|
| 0:00:53| I can't imagine there being a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=53)|
| 0:00:55| It doesn't take much time for them to set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=55)|
| 0:00:58| Let's go until they kick us out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=58)|
| 0:01:00| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=60)|
| 0:01:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=61)|
| 0:01:02| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=62)|
| 0:01:03| We'll just go in here until they kick us out, but we'll figure around 530-ish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=63)|
| 0:01:06| I'd like to recognize Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=66)|
| 0:01:07| What we would like to do is have Commissioner Norman and his group make comments that they want to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=67)|
| 0:01:12| and then those of you who would like to make comments, you're going to be given that opportunity to do so as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=72)|
| 0:01:17| So, Commissioner Norman, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=77)|
| 0:01:20| Question first, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=80)|
| 0:01:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=81)|
| 0:01:22| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=82)|
| 0:01:22| I'm sure that there are, there's not one spokesman that represents all of the views in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=82)|
| 0:01:32| What setup are you going to have for those in the audience who want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=92)|
| 0:01:37| Because I know there's a bunch that want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=97)|
| 0:01:39| Well, our normal is five minutes, but we could go three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=99)|
| 0:01:43| What's the wish of the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| Yes, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=105)|
| 0:01:46| Yeah, I would just, Mr. Chairman, just suggest that maybe you just give us an overview of how we're going to conduct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=106)|
| 0:01:52| this, is there going to be a presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=112)|
| 0:01:55| and then we have the opportunity for either commissioners or private citizens to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=115)|
| 0:02:01| And just what's going to be the format for this workshop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=121)|
| 0:02:05| Commissioner Norman has a brief presentation he wants to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=125)|
| 0:02:09| and then they're willing to ask, answer any questions we might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| Then we want to hear from those in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| And I'm sure that if there are questions, you know, you all will control that discussion as to how many questions you want to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=135)|
| 0:02:21| But do we want to give the public five minutes or do we want to do three minutes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=141)|
| 0:02:26| I'm willing to stay here as long as we need to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=146)|
| 0:02:29| Could we maybe see a show of hands of everybody who wants to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| I think five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| Five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=155)|
| 0:02:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=156)|
| 0:02:37| And then any commissioner that wants can always extend that if they would like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=157)|
| 0:02:40| So if that's acceptable, that's the way we'll proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=160)|
| 0:02:43| I guess a question on process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| Because what I don't want is they say, well, in the final analysis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=167)|
| 0:02:52| you spent an hour from presentations to support to other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=172)|
| 0:02:57| and then the folks who are against this program say that they only got five minutes from three people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=177)|
| 0:03:06| So I'm kind of getting to what Commissioner Briggs is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| I'd like to kind of will the people who are maybe not supporting this have opportunity to ask questions from the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=191)|
| 0:03:21| or will they only get up and give their five minutes and not get a response from MPC or this body or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=201)|
| 0:03:29| I would like for them to get a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| Mr. Chairman, could I interject something here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=215)|
| 0:03:37| It is my understanding that in the discussion the last time that we met, the previous workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=217)|
| 0:03:46| that we would be given a designated amount of time to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=226)|
| 0:03:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=231)|
| 0:03:52| So that's what we plan for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=232)|
| 0:03:54| We plan for a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=234)|
| 0:03:56| I'm assuming that the opposition has planned for a presentation also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=236)|
| 0:04:04| It would probably, maybe for the sake of civility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=244)|
| 0:04:10| we were hoping that supporters or opposition speakers to either side would take place on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=250)|
| 0:04:22| We do not have a presentation planned for Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=262)|
| 0:04:27| We do have people that have expressed the wish to speak in behalf of the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=267)|
| 0:04:34| and of the plan on Monday and we've said that will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=274)|
| 0:04:38| We expressly said today that we are presenting, we want the focus on the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=278)|
| 0:04:46| and we asked them not to speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| So it's up to the will of the body, but that's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=289)|
| 0:04:56| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=296)|
| 0:04:57| Let me ask, how long do you think your presentation is going to take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| We're guessing that 20 minutes-ish, 20 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=300)|
| 0:05:05| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=305)|
| 0:05:06| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| I think, Mr. Norman, that the situation has maybe, well, the interest has shifted in the last three weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=308)|
| 0:05:19| You all have got as many e-mails, phone calls that I have that everybody gets the same ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=319)|
| 0:05:26| And I think this is an issue that we need to let it be aired out fully so that everybody's on the dance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=326)|
| 0:05:33| of the same music before we bring it to a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| So whatever time it takes, if it takes two more meetings, whatever it takes, I think we need to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=336)|
| 0:05:43| My goal, ladies and gentlemen, is for people to leave here today and feel like they've been treated fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| So whether you're in favor of it or you're against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| I would like for you to at least feel like that you've been treated fairly by this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| So that's going to be my goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| So I'm going to be giving folks some leeway here so that we can hear comments and that, again, that's the goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=355)|
| 0:06:02| So, Commissioner Norman, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=362)|
| 0:06:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=365)|
| 0:06:07| Believe it or not, this is a very happy day for many of us because we fully intend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=367)|
| 0:06:15| and expect that at the end of these presentations this matter will be settled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=375)|
| 0:06:22| And we're very hopeful that this body is able to go home and have it settled for them tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=382)|
| 0:06:30| We don't want it to go any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=390)|
| 0:06:33| It has been a long, long road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| And so it's a very happy day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=396)|
| 0:06:38| I may jump up and start singing that old gospel tune at the end of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=398)|
| 0:06:45| Well, anyway, thank you for the privilege of letting me introduce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| And my role here is just to provide a framework for what we're going to do in our presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=410)|
| 0:06:59| and then get out of the way and let the professionals, who we have many who have supported this talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=419)|
| 0:07:08| I see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=428)|
| 0:07:09| I did want to provide a little bit of context for what's going on because it's been pretty vigorous in the media here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=429)|
| 0:07:16| in the last week or so and e-mails and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| So I see this as certainly we've got a clash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=442)|
| 0:07:28| The clash is ostensibly between a couple of sides of the task force, the MPC staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=448)|
| 0:07:37| that has represented us in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=457)|
| 0:07:41| We have a position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=461)|
| 0:07:43| We were charged with the task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| We were supposed to study this and come back with recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=465)|
| 0:07:50| That's what we've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=470)|
| 0:07:52| And we've presented this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=472)|
| 0:07:55| And it's a thorough document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=475)|
| 0:07:57| And it represents the work of this task force well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| The clash is with a side that I think I generally would characterize them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=481)|
| 0:08:08| And I'm not trying to be harsh in any way, but the sort of classical development interest in this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=488)|
| 0:08:15| and sort of the old guard development interest in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=495)|
| 0:08:20| And they have been in place for quite a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=500)|
| 0:08:27| I think it also is a clash somewhat between, regrettably, between a reasoned approach to planning and emotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=507)|
| 0:08:41| And there's absolutely reason for emotion in a climate like we experience today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=521)|
| 0:08:50| I mean, these people that are in the development community, in the building trades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=530)|
| 0:08:56| home builders association, this is their livelihood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=536)|
| 0:09:01| They are experiencing distress in ways that I don't, I'm not aware of in my own personal experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=541)|
| 0:09:12| But I know how distressing it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| This is an emotional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=555)|
| 0:09:17| It's an emotional subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| And certainly we intend, we know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| And it is certainly our intent to be sensitive to these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=565)|
| 0:09:32| Now, in the end, this is a development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=572)|
| 0:09:35| What I hope the body will see that it's about development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| It's about these hillsides and ridgetops being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| That's the strange thing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| The irony is that there's a development interest that's against a plan that's for a type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=587)|
| 0:09:57| It's just a type of development that's different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| There is some more structure that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=602)|
| 0:10:06| It is not radically different from what already exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=606)|
| 0:10:11| And you will see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| In fact, we've adopted, we're on the verge of adopting the East Knox County Sector Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=613)|
| 0:10:20| which is a mirror image of what's in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=620)|
| 0:10:23| We've adopted the Parks and Greenways Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| They have exactly the same provisions for hillside protection as in this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=626)|
| 0:10:34| So, now we're going to, the presentation itself, which I just want to outline briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=634)|
| 0:10:44| First, we want to talk about this development plan and its incentives, the incentives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| We want to emphasize how we are trying to accommodate development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=650)|
| 0:10:55| The next part of the presentation will be about this issue of notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=655)|
| 0:11:02| Now, notification is where the property rights issue, property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=662)|
| 0:11:08| We're all very aware and interested in everybody's property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=668)|
| 0:11:16| And this is where the poison has been poured.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| And this is sort of a hinge point in the argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| I think when we finish with this part of the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| you'll be aware that this is much more complex than what the opposition would lead us to believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=689)|
| 0:11:36| It's not a $15,000 issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| It's hundreds of thousands of dollars that we are going to be involved in if we go down this path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=700)|
| 0:11:48| Now, we'll make the contention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| What we have done and what we are doing is standard operating procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=712)|
| 0:12:00| This is what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=720)|
| 0:12:02| This is how we've done it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=722)|
| 0:12:05| If we want to do something else, we will make the contention that this will be grossly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=725)|
| 0:12:13| physically irresponsible on our part to make this deviation from standard procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=733)|
| 0:12:21| at this time for this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=741)|
| 0:12:26| Now, the chamber has brought up some good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=746)|
| 0:12:33| We're going to address taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=753)|
| 0:12:36| I hope you'll pay particular attention to the people who have officially endorsed this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| Twenty-one members who have worked for three years on this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=763)|
| 0:12:49| They put their names on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=769)|
| 0:12:51| They voted yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| Pay attention to the names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| They're in the slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| Pay attention to the MPC commissioners and their businesses, their CEOs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=777)|
| 0:13:05| the development interests that are on the MPC who has studied the plan thoroughly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=785)|
| 0:13:12| They have said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=792)|
| 0:13:15| That's 33 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=795)|
| 0:13:17| Twenty-one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Eleven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| Thirty-two people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=799)|
| 0:13:21| Notice who they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=801)|
| 0:13:23| Notice the business, the businesses, and the development interests they represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=803)|
| 0:13:30| We have said this is broadly supported by business and development, and I think you'll see that's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=810)|
| 0:13:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=818)|
| 0:13:39| Now, I'm done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| I want to yield to Mr. Jarrett for some recurring issues that we'd like to dispose of before the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=820)|
| 0:13:51| I do want to acknowledge my co-chair, Joe Holquist, who's here accompanying the presenters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=831)|
| 0:13:58| Mike Carberry, Liz Albertson, Tim Coon, Mike Reynolds, and they're here in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=838)|
| 0:14:05| So I yield to Mr. Jarrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=845)|
| 0:14:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=848)|
| 0:14:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=849)|
| 0:14:14| I think it's important to reiterate that right now this is a workshop, and you're not enacting any laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| What you're looking at at this juncture is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| Over the last 20 years, having litigated numerous land use and planning issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| two recurring things occur that usually give pause to the citizens and to the development community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=868)|
| 0:14:35| and it's no different here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| The first one is public notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| How are we going to know whether or not you're going to change my land use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| What effect will this have on my property in terms of future development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| And there's always the cost-benefit analysis for government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=887)|
| 0:14:50| Do you go with, as some jurisdictions do, a postcard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| Do you expend public monies to go to something more onerous, like, for instance, first-class mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=894)|
| 0:15:00| or to even further to certified mail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| But, you know, the law essentially provides and requires reasonable notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=903)|
| 0:15:08| and oftentimes you'll find that the two things that derail workshops of this nature are the notice requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=908)|
| 0:15:16| and then, secondly, the claim that the plan is essentially a taking of my property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=916)|
| 0:15:24| Under Tennessee law, promulgated down from the Tennessee Supreme Court and even to the U.S. Supreme Court,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=924)|
| 0:15:31| government has the ability to take private land for public use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=931)|
| 0:15:35| It's called a taking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=935)|
| 0:15:36| It's called condemnation of property, as you're aware.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=936)|
| 0:15:39| What occurs, however, there are cases whereby, although the government doesn't actually seize private land for public use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=939)|
| 0:15:47| it renders the property in such a manner that it makes it either undevelopable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| or it renders the property in such a manner that you can't get its highest and best use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| When that occurs, the government essentially is sued under the concept of inverse condemnation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=957)|
| 0:16:04| Now, what the U.S. Supreme Court has said and what our courts have consistently said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| that when you're dealing with merely a plan, not an ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=968)|
| 0:16:13| but when you're talking about the enactment of a plan, that is not sufficient to render a claim of inverse condemnation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=973)|
| 0:16:21| So the point is the way our laws have been enacted, by looking at a plan, by adopting a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=981)|
| 0:16:30| that is not a situation whereby people can then say, well, you've seized my property for public use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=990)|
| 0:16:38| and I no longer can use it for the intent that I originally had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| So the bottom line, at this juncture, when you're merely dealing with a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1002)|
| 0:16:47| when you're looking at an aspirational goal, you're not affecting anyone's property, right, at this juncture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1007)|
| 0:16:53| Now, ultimately, if you, on a case-by-case basis, start looking at someone's property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1013)|
| 0:16:59| and you enact a zoning that could possibly affect it, they have redress through the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1019)|
| 0:17:04| But at this juncture, those two recurring concerns, notice and the possibility of a taking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1024)|
| 0:17:12| are what normally destroy the ability of a good dialogue over a proposed aspirational plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1032)|
| 0:17:21| I'd be glad to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1041)|
| 0:17:29| No questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| We're ready for our presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| And so Mike Carberry will start us out and proceed through the PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1055)|
| 0:17:49| I have looked around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1069)|
| 0:17:51| I've seen some new faces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| So we're going to go through a quick overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| You've seen some of these slides as far as what the plan is about at your last workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1074)|
| 0:18:01| But we're also going to talk about the responses to concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| and the amendments that were made by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| In looking at the plan principles, a couple of major points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1089)|
| 0:18:16| As Tony said, the plan allows development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| It just avoids higher intensity development on hillsides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1099)|
| 0:18:23| And it provides opportunity for cluster development, sometimes an even greater density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| And then it fosters open space corridors, such as those by the Legacy Park Foundation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1108)|
| 0:18:35| which are being pursued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1115)|
| 0:18:40| It's advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1120)|
| 0:18:41| It's not regulatory, as Mr. Jarrett just outlined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1121)|
| 0:18:45| I want to talk about these policy and budget decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1125)|
| 0:18:49| The policies in the plan are in regard to density, primarily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| Examples of some budget decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| One of the incentives, as you'll see, is narrower roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| And that can lead to lower county maintenance costs after those roads are accepted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1140)|
| 0:19:07| And finally, if a budget decision is made over time to provide matching funds for matches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1147)|
| 0:19:15| to private sector development, like Legacy Parks, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| that kind of thing would be the funds that were put into Seven Islands Wildlife Reserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1161)|
| 0:19:26| by the county in response to the Wildlife Refuges Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1166)|
| 0:19:35| As early as 1960, the protection of open space in hillside areas was identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1175)|
| 0:19:42| This was the land use plan for many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| It was the basis, as our sector plans are now, for zoning decisions by both the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1186)|
| 0:19:54| The concept has been continued over the decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1194)|
| 0:20:00| Here's the general plan map that was prepared in 1980 for the 2000s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| Again, a system of open spaces and low-intensity development was proposed as part of that plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1205)|
| 0:20:13| When we look at the proposal for the hillside area and what we have under consideration now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1213)|
| 0:20:20| it's borrowing from our GIS system, which until 2003 could not adequately address exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1220)|
| 0:20:29| where slopes over 15% are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| And I'm sure there will be some questions on that science of geographic information systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1232)|
| 0:20:38| My colleague, Tim Kuhn, is here and can address those later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1238)|
| 0:20:45| In the next slide, what you see in darker green against the very light green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| is the proposed hillside area in relation to the area that's recognized as a rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1251)|
| 0:20:57| in the adopted growth plan of 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| Slightly more than 60% of the rural area has the hillside areas that are being proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1261)|
| 0:21:13| The policy in that growth policy plan is one dwelling unit per acre on 15-25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1273)|
| 0:21:20| And then if any rezonings are requested, one dwelling unit per acre, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1280)|
| 0:21:28| per two acres when a rezoning is requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1288)|
| 0:21:33| By right now, as long as they can get a septic system to work, can ask for one acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1293)|
| 0:21:43| That's not being changed with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1303)|
| 0:21:49| Not all ridges are the iconic ones that we easily identify with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| Sharps Ridge, McAnally Ridge, we've got some very complex areas like the Browns Mountain area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| and the associated ridges with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| This also characterizes the area north of Copper Ridge in North Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1323)|
| 0:22:09| and a good portion of East Knox County, particularly above the French Broad River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1329)|
| 0:22:17| A couple of basic overall policies, and these are rather simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1337)|
| 0:22:29| The steeper the slope, the less the amount of housing density and the less the amount of clearance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1349)|
| 0:22:38| And then also look after protection of the natural beauty of ridge tops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1358)|
| 0:22:44| On the next slide, you're going to see what is really a density formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1364)|
| 0:22:49| This is what MPC uses every month to make its planned residential zoning recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1369)|
| 0:22:57| to the MPC itself and then to either you or city council, depending on the jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1377)|
| 0:23:06| These densities can be shifted around within a hillside parcel to where,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1386)|
| 0:23:14| if there's level areas within it, units can be clustered in one area under planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1394)|
| 0:23:22| or clustered outside the hillside area and lower slopes altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| As far as that no development over 50%, there's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1408)|
| 0:23:34| There's only one parcel, other than a few that are 19 parcels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| were platted for mobile homes on Beaver Ridge and a few lots in Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1420)|
| 0:23:48| They were never developed, otherwise there's no parcel which has all of its land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1428)|
| 0:23:54| in a slope that's over 50%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1434)|
| 0:24:01| Just some examples so you can visualize a 15 to 25%, and that's pretty typical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1441)|
| 0:24:09| of 15 to 25% slope groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| Forest Hills and Sequoia Hills have extensive areas like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| These densities happen to be roughly two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1459)|
| 0:24:25| Note the road system on the slide on the left in Forest Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| That's about a 20-foot pavement which is being fostered under this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1471)|
| 0:24:35| Allow that by right rather than have to ask for permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1475)|
| 0:24:39| In the next example, we see a recent rezoning case and redevelopment of a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1479)|
| 0:24:47| called The Retreat off of Eddington Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| The developer, 2.8 dwelling units per acre was recommended and approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1491)|
| 0:24:57| and in turn, the developer chose to cluster all those units up on top| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1497)|
| 0:25:03| of the plateau of this knoll, leaving the open space as far as the ridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1503)|
| 0:25:09| and where the developer had to cut in for building sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1509)|
| 0:25:15| Those areas have been reforested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| Beyond the 82,000 acres that are within the hillside area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1520)|
| 0:25:28| there's already almost 50,000 acres which is already developed with low-density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1528)|
| 0:25:34| residential housing types such as Lions Bend, Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1534)|
| 0:25:40| Those areas are also included in that, but people that live in those areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1540)|
| 0:25:45| are somewhat vested into having land uses that are similar and can be reflected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1545)|
| 0:25:53| in the long term in that those sloped areas can be preserved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| The main points here is that 76,000 new dwelling units or 190,000 new people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1559)|
| 0:26:07| can be accommodated in the identified hillside area that's vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| Outside of the hillside area, another 103,000 dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1573)|
| 0:26:21| or 230,000 residents can be accommodated with the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1581)|
| 0:26:27| So the bottom line as far as county growth, given current policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1587)|
| 0:26:32| and the proposed policies, would be enough to accommodate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1592)|
| 0:26:37| and you'll see this in the next slide, 185,000 housing units or about 420,000 people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1597)|
| 0:26:45| enough to double the size of Knox County, and that does not include the town of Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1605)|
| 0:26:52| or redevelopment areas like the South Waterfront.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| Why incentives?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| The task force wanted to have carrots in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1620)|
| 0:27:07| so it would make it easier for development under certain circumstances for the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1627)|
| 0:27:13| They save time and money, make it easier to work, such as the narrower roads and less grading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| and one doesn't have to ask for permission as far as the variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1639)|
| 0:27:23| So I'm going to go through some of those incentives rather quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| This is the list of overall ones, and I'm going to touch upon several of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| in the next series of slides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| Reduced setbacks, some residential zones require 50 or more feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| of front yard setback space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| Flexibility is promoted by the plan to skinny up lot sizes so that they can be brought out close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1666)|
| 0:27:52| to the road in hillside areas, requiring less clearing and still enabling development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1672)|
| 0:27:58| And looking at the reduced pavement, this is the standard that is being set in the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1678)|
| 0:28:08| or suggested for improvements in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| Right now, the planning commission may consider these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| What we're saying is let the developer use these without asking for permission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1698)|
| 0:28:29| Next slide is on reduced off-street parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1709)|
| 0:28:34| I'm going to give you an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1714)|
| 0:28:37| Right now in commercial zones, the county requires five parking spaces for every 1,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| of commercial buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| You go to a shopping center, you can see the vast areas of parking that are underutilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| What we're suggesting in the plan for adoption in phase two is allow lower minimums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1732)|
| 0:29:00| and let that be the developer's choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1740)|
| 0:29:05| And also that the county look at reducing the required stall from 200 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| to 180 square feet on average like the city does already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1750)|
| 0:29:15| Those provisions have already been adopted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| with the guidelines of the Tennessee Technology Corridor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| a plan which you recently adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| Finally, we've talked about bonus densities at our various meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1770)|
| 0:29:37| This is in the form of, for a conservation easement, one can have smaller lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1777)|
| 0:29:42| and it could be done through just PR zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1782)|
| 0:29:47| If a conservation easement is put on some of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1787)|
| 0:29:52| or it could be done in a so-called conservation subdivision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| which could have skinnier streets, it could have shorter utility lengths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| so your infrastructure costs and road costs would be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1802)|
| 0:30:07| At this point, I'm going to hand it over to Tim Coon for a few minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1807)|
| 0:30:12| on public notification, and then I'll come back to go over the amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1812)|
| 0:30:17| by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| Good afternoon. My name is Tim Coon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| I'm the GIS manager at the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1827)|
| 0:30:32| And in general, we think this issue of notification, I'm sure we'll hear more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| First, there is probably the sense that some property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| that are falling inside of the proposed hillside and ridgetop protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| aren't aware of the plan or may not have had the opportunity to provide input into the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| The second issue seems to be that property within the hillside area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| would somehow, its ability to be developed would somehow be curtailed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| by the adoption of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1862)|
| 0:31:07| So we'll start by looking first at the issue of the public involvement strategy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| It's up there on the screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| The development of this plan was initiated in March 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| with the formation of the Joint City-County Task Force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| These meetings have been as frequent as any other plan that MPC has ever developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| And the total number of public meetings, task force meetings, and commission meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| various workshops and such, is approaching nearly 100 meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| All of these meetings were publicly noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| They've all been properly noticed through the county commission and city council offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| Now during the course of the plan development itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| a hillside area was defined, a hillside and ridgetop protection area as it's termed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| It includes about 63,000 parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1923)|
| 0:32:08| We have estimated that notification of the property owners inside this hillside protection area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| will cost about $17,000 for the mailing of a postcard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| with information about the plan, who to contact for more information, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1938)|
| 0:32:23| So although there's been numerous, almost unprecedented opportunities for public input,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| there's still a sense that, and actually there's been quite a bit of media coverage by the plan too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1948)|
| 0:32:35| there's still the sense that we need to notify property owners about the plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| And what is driving that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1960)|
| 0:32:45| Property owners are somehow affected by the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| so we want to talk a little bit more detail about how property owners would actually be affected under the adoption of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| We hear repeatedly, the plan adopts, or the plan affects 63,000 parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| So saying that property owners are affected by the plan seems to indicate that it somehow has an ability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1980)|
| 0:33:07| or the plan somehow has an impact on their ability to develop their property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1987)|
| 0:33:12| under their current uses, given to them by rights, under their current zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| So we don't want to be dismissive of the argument that this is going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| but because this is only a plan, we don't really feel that this is a case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| and that the plan will not impact the vast majority of the property owners that fall within the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| First, this is only a plan. It's not regulatory. There's no enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2012)|
| 0:33:37| It's adopted along with the plan itself. But how will the plan itself be used?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| Following adoption, the plan can be used in three ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2022)|
| 0:33:47| First, it's a set of recommendations that are presented to the legislative bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| that can be used to develop ordinance changes that might affect hillside area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| both through the development of incentives and regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| This is phase one of what is a multi-phase plan, at least two phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| Phase one is simply adoption of the plan. Phase two is where the actual ordinances are crafted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2047)|
| 0:34:12| and any ordinances that were created will be passed on to the county commission for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| The second way the plan is used is in the development of recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2057)|
| 0:34:22| when rezoning requests are submitted to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| Any application that's submitted to the planning commission comes with an MPC staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| These recommendations sometimes match the request of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| Sometimes they do not match the request of the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| Both of those are forwarded to the MPC for approval, modification, or denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| Those requests are then forwarded to the county commission for approval, modification, or denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| This plan is only used in the development of recommendations for zones when rezonings are requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2093)|
| 0:35:03| The third way the plan is used is to identify steep slope areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| when a staff review of site plans is conducted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2108)|
| 0:35:13| The staff review of site plans is a process that requires a site plan to be submitted to the planning commission prior to a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2113)|
| 0:35:19| The site plans lay out things such as setbacks, parking, and drainage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| and some of the major aspects of the site's development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| It's a multi-agency review, including review by engineering departments and other county departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2129)|
| 0:35:34| This plan would be used in that process just to identify where the steeply sloped portions of the site is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2134)|
| 0:35:44| So that's the extent of how the plan would be used if it was adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2144)|
| 0:35:49| But what doesn't the plan do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2149)|
| 0:35:54| The plan doesn't change any current or future uses permitted under a property's current zoning or under the property's proposed land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2154)|
| 0:36:00| Whatever the zoning of a property within the hillside area is will remain with that property after the adoption of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2160)|
| 0:36:06| Whatever rights are associated with the development of that property under its current zoning remain after the adoption of this plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| Zoning and land use are unaffected by the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| The plan adoption does not include any changes to requirements or regulations associated with the development of a parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2177)|
| 0:36:25| The current ordinances regulating stormwater and other development practices themselves are unchanged after this plan is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2185)|
| 0:36:41| Next we'd like to discuss the precedent of notification itself and the potential cost impacts that are associated with the decision to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2201)|
| 0:36:47| notify citizens of Knox Canada within the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| First we'd like to point out that 73,000 parcels, there are 63,000 parcels within the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2212)|
| 0:36:58| 43,000 of those parcels are single family homes or vacant lots that are proposed for single family homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2218)|
| 0:37:04| The likelihood of their ever applying for a rezoning or submitting a site plan for review is practically zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2224)|
| 0:37:13| They're certainly entitled to do so, but the likelihood of that happening is practically zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| By notifying them, we're in essence telling them of a small revision in the way that staff recommendations at MPC are developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2239)|
| 0:37:27| That is in essence what we would be explaining to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2247)|
| 0:37:33| Secondly, it is not currently MPC's practice to notify people that fall within a plan area when a plan is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2253)|
| 0:37:43| For starters, it's not required by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| State law simply says that you need to advertise that the plan is up for adoption via the newspaper with the highest circulation 30 days before the hearing for adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2268)|
| 0:37:54| Second is that notification as part of this process of plan adoption, the hillside protection plan, would be outside of the line of what most communities do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2274)|
| 0:38:07| I imagine today you'll hear something about Sevier County adopting its hillside plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2287)|
| 0:38:12| Property owners within the hillside area that Sevier County adopted were not notified either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| It's standard practice to not notify when a plan is developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2297)|
| 0:38:24| From a technical standpoint, we think that this plan is no different from adopting a sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2304)|
| 0:38:30| Sector plans are used as a basis for making recommendations on future rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2310)|
| 0:38:37| Because this is the same manner in which the hillside plan would be used, we feel like we're having a precedent setting policy change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2317)|
| 0:38:45| that's going to occur as a result of this that would require the notification of property owners for all plans, not just the hillside plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2325)|
| 0:38:53| This shift in thinking would not come without a cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2333)|
| 0:38:58| Adoption of a sector plan would require the notification of each property owner within that sector plan's area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2338)|
| 0:39:04| On average, this could cost about $10,000 a year for just the notification cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2344)|
| 0:39:10| If you expand that to a countywide plan, in our view, the hillside and ridgetop protection plan is a countywide plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2350)|
| 0:39:17| It doesn't just affect people that have property inside the hillside protection area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2357)|
| 0:39:23| It's $70,000 per plan for just a simple postcard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2363)|
| 0:39:28| In the case of the recently adopted city and county parks and greenway plan, that's what would have been the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2368)|
| 0:39:34| If we want to expand that to a letter, we're talking $70,000 per notification, potentially with multiple notifications per plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2374)|
| 0:39:42| It's important to understand that this would be a new standard for notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| We do view notification as an important issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2387)|
| 0:39:52| I want you to understand that there is a long-term cost associated with this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2392)|
| 0:40:01| I want to turn to the several amendments that the Planning Commission made during their adoption of the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2401)|
| 0:40:09| First of all, there was more flexibility for commercial opportunities and office and medium density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| The first of these is to recognize that special districts can be created.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2415)|
| 0:40:27| This is the Wells Fargo building at North Shore and I-40. It was in an office area in our sector plan and was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2427)|
| 0:40:35| We're recognizing in the plan that when you have the nexus of good infrastructure and arterial highways and freeways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| that such development is appropriate and should be considered within the hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2441)|
| 0:40:53| The previous draft that the task force had presented said no commercial development below 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2453)|
| 0:41:02| The Planning Commission amended that to allow cuts into the hillside up to 25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2462)|
| 0:41:10| The plan allows office and medium density development on slopes between 15 and 20 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2470)|
| 0:41:41| That was another policy that was tweaked during the Planning Commission's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2501)|
| 0:41:49| Also, we've recommended that height be allowed to be considered for an increase when there's level areas at the toe of the slope that fall within a hillside parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2509)|
| 0:42:10| Turning to tax-based concerns, the growth policy plan, general plan, and sector plans are examples where hillsides and ridges have been the locations of low-density residential and other low-intensity uses that's been done for, again, a better part of several decades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2530)|
| 0:42:33| Looking at the next slide, we can see the commercial or planned areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2553)|
| 0:42:41| There are seven zoned areas within the hillside, and there's only 500 vacant acres within the hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2561)|
| 0:42:50| That's only 5% of the hillside area, I mean 0.5%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2570)|
| 0:42:55| Also, most of that is already zoned for commercial purposes, and that would not be affected under this plan as those previously zoned parcels are grandfathered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2575)|
| 0:43:10| What's the effect in the experience of other places?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2590)|
| 0:43:15| Brentwood, Asheville, Huntsville, Fayetteville have not experienced a diminution in the tax base because of their hillside policies or ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| There are 1,900 vacant acres outside of the hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2601)|
| 0:43:40| When we say vacant, that's largely large tracts that are completely vacant, but it also includes a house on the hillside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2620)|
| 0:43:50| 2 to 10 acres, that's recognized in the plan for commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2630)|
| 0:43:55| You can picture places along Rutledge Pike or Asheville Highway or along Middlebrook Pike, or a house is converted often into an office or another commercial use or torn down for redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2635)|
| 0:44:10| So that's included in that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2650)|
| 0:44:15| When you translate it into building square feet, it can accommodate 21 million square feet of new buildings outside the hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2655)|
| 0:44:27| That's the equivalent of 15 Westtown malls or eight new Turkey Creeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2667)|
| 0:44:36| The non-commercial area, which includes residential, agricultural, and public-institutional, is 90% vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2676)|
| 0:44:45| 7%, 3% are commercial, and by that I mean retail, office, or industrial lands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2685)|
| 0:44:53| And keep in mind that retail and office are allowed with the provisions that I went through before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2693)|
| 0:45:02| Now looking at some effects on business growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2702)|
| 0:45:07| Industrial and business parks, in working with a development corporation, we have never looked at business park sites on land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2707)|
| 0:45:15| That was in excess of 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2715)|
| 0:45:21| And finally, I'm sure that you have been given this couldn't-been-built scenarios by some folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2721)|
| 0:45:32| Most of the projects that were mentioned in those are not in the hillside area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2732)|
| 0:45:38| Some, like this building and pilot headquarters, were constructed under the Hillside Area Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2738)|
| 0:45:45| Under a zone that allowed hillside development to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2745)|
| 0:45:51| Downtown now has its own design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| This building was called for in a master plan that had been approved by the legislative body back in the 1970s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2756)|
| 0:46:05| And then finally, this is the first of two slides that Commissioner Norman referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2765)|
| 0:46:15| And you can see the members of the task force and their professions who voted for the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2775)|
| 0:46:23| And in the final slide, you can see the list of the MPC commissioners and professionals who voted for the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2783)|
| 0:46:33| And that concludes our presentation, and I'm going to hand it back to you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2793)|
| 0:46:39| Mr. Norman, is this an appropriate time for people to ask questions if they have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2799)|
| 0:46:45| It's whatever you'd like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| If there's a presentation by the opposition, if they want to go, that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2810)|
| 0:46:55| Whatever you all would like to do, however you'd like to proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2815)|
| 0:47:01| Let me ask, does anyone have questions of those who have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| Going back to the notification part, the process, the notification, you say that this is just a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2826)|
| 0:47:12| but later in your statement you made the comment plans are the basis for zoning decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2832)|
| 0:47:19| And so we're eventually, if we're going to, this is just a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| It's what we based our zoning decisions on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2844)|
| 0:47:29| We are changing the value of people's property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2849)|
| 0:47:34| There was a Fox Road development down there that, you know, the sector plan is just that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2854)|
| 0:47:39| It's just a plan, but without that sector plan amendment, we couldn't zone that to a Fox Road restaurant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2859)|
| 0:47:46| Whether we thought it was a good idea or not to put a restaurant down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2866)|
| 0:47:51| nobody wanted to change the plan because it was a spot plan change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2871)|
| 0:47:56| And so if this is just a plan and it doesn't affect zonings, explain to me how the sector plan has to be changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| for a spot zone, or if we can't change the sector plan in a spot zoning, if nothing around it's changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| how does this not affect property rights and property owners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2886)|
| 0:48:11| I'll take a crack at that one. Mark Donaldson with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| One, the plan is advisory, not regulatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2896)|
| 0:48:21| The plan is used to guide MPC staff in making recommendations on densities when we're dealing with requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2901)|
| 0:48:26| for residential rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2906)|
| 0:48:31| Those density recommendations are not always followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| A density recommendation from staff can be doubled as it moves through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2916)|
| 0:48:41| It can be cut in half as it moves through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2921)|
| 0:48:46| With regard to non-residential zoning requests,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2926)|
| 0:48:51| again, that a planned commercial district be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2931)|
| 0:48:56| We've maintained that type of recommendation in the current plan and allowed non-residential development in areas up to 25% slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2936)|
| 0:49:07| And again, that is a basis for a recommendation from staff in the initial phase of a rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2947)|
| 0:49:14| A recent case that came through that had existing slope protection area on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2954)|
| 0:49:21| from a plan adopted in 2003, staff recommended that a planned commercial district be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2961)|
| 0:49:29| The planning commission recommended that a straight zoning district be used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2969)|
| 0:49:34| but with site plan approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2974)|
| 0:49:39| Ultimately, the legislative body approved a straight OB zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| The plan is used to guide recommendations on the initial phases of rezoning requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2984)|
| 0:49:51| As a result of adopting the plan, no zoning district will be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2991)|
| 0:49:58| No current development right will be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| No planned land use classification of residential or commercial will be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3004)|
| 0:50:12| We will simply be modifying the slope protection area and adding to it the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3012)|
| 0:50:18| that we would identify as the ridgetops, as the area which guides our recommendations on the front end of zoning requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3018)|
| 0:50:26| So we already have a slope protection plan in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| And I'm just going off the notes I just tried to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3032)|
| 0:50:37| 15% to 40% there's no change in residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3037)|
| 0:50:42| Your statement was there's no zoning changes in residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| In the 15% to 40% there's no change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3047)|
| 0:50:52| In the recommended densities for residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3052)|
| 0:50:57| 40 to 50 there's one unit per four acres. Is that a change? I'm assuming it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| The current plans are quiet on any further separation above 25%, so we just further narrowed those classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3062)|
| 0:51:08| And in the pilot travel centers, Flying J Travel Centers, was built under an existing plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3068)|
| 0:51:14| I believe that's in a planned zone district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| That was a statement made. It was built under the current slope plan was his statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| Special district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3084)|
| 0:51:29| That particular area would fall into what we are calling for a special district classification in the recommendations in the proposed plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3089)|
| 0:51:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3094)|
| 0:51:39| And then when we talked about the retreat in South Knoxville, I thought it was kind of neat that we asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| Is Arthur here still? Arthur Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| Arthur, can you come down for just a second? Just refresh my memory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3109)|
| 0:51:54| You did the retreat. You represented the developers of the retreat in South Knoxville. Is that correct? Off Eddington Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| I represented the woodlands and the cottages up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3119)|
| 0:52:05| But what they did was they requested it. Let's say for easy math, let's say there's 100 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| They got 400 per acre. They got 400 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3130)|
| 0:52:15| They put it at the bottom of the hill for economic reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3135)|
| 0:52:20| Correct. The hillsides were essentially, you couldn't build on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| Economics drove that decision at the retreat to do exactly what I think the ridgetop people want to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3145)|
| 0:52:31| It drove it to the bottom just based on economics, not based on MPC's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3151)|
| 0:52:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110222part1?start=3156)|
