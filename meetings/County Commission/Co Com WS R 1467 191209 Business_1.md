| 2:26:25| Has that now changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8785)|
| 2:26:27| No, it's always been a permanent easement, is what it's called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8787)|
| 2:26:31| And so then I can defer to Mark on this, but I think in seven to ten years, they sell the underlying property back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8791)|
| 2:26:40| And is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8800)|
| 2:26:41| Seven to ten, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8801)|
| 2:26:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8807)|
| 2:26:48| And then as far as utilizing the TVA towers for other government operations than the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8808)|
| 2:26:55| because it's a federal building, the courts could never move there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8815)|
| 2:26:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8818)|
| 2:26:59| Courts could never move there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8819)|
| 2:27:01| Probation could never move there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8821)|
| 2:27:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8823)|
| 2:27:04| But other things can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8824)|
| 2:27:06| And so an election cannot move there because of the Hatch Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8826)|
| 2:27:10| But the mayor's office could move there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8830)|
| 2:27:13| Any other office that falls under the mayor could move there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8833)|
| 2:27:18| If we talk to other elected officials, they may have a desire to move there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8838)|
| 2:27:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8843)|
| 2:27:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8844)|
| 2:27:26| Thank you, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8846)|
| 2:27:27| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8849)|
| 2:27:30| I just want to remind everybody, the motion on the floor is to move forward with no recommendation on item 41,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8850)|
| 2:27:37| which is a contract between Knox County and TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8857)|
| 2:27:42| Having nothing to do with the schools whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8862)|
| 2:27:45| So I'd like to call for the vote to move forward with no recommendation as the motion is on the floor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8865)|
| 2:27:51| move this to next week, where no doubt there will be a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8871)|
| 2:27:55| and something to look at that is in more permanent form as we do pretty much every commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8875)|
| 2:28:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8880)|

| 2:28:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8882)|
| 2:28:03| We have a motion from Commissioner Jay and a second from Commissioner Anders to go ahead and call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8883)|
| 2:28:07| All in favor, will this need to be a roll call or could this be a verbal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8887)|
| 2:28:12| Verbal is fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8892)|

| 2:30:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9031)|
| 2:30:32| Madam Clerk, we concluded with item 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9032)|
| 2:30:35| We're now on item 42.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9035)|
| 2:30:38| This is a resolution approving a real property purchase and sale agreement in the amount of $6 million with BMA Associates LLC for the sale and redevelopment of the Andrew Johnson Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9038)|
| 2:30:50| Motion to send without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9050)|
| 2:30:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9052)|
| 2:30:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9053)|
| 2:30:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9054)|
| 2:30:56| We've got a motion to send forward with no recommendation from Commissioner Anders and, frankly, I heard Commissioner Jay was the second on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9056)|
| 2:31:05| Is there any discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9067)|
| 2:31:10| The chair concurs that there's so many things that are tangled up here that it's probably in the best interest for everyone to send that forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9070)|
| 2:31:17| So all in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9077)|
| 2:31:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9079)|

| 2:31:23| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9083)|
| 2:31:24| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9084)|
| 2:31:26| This is item 43, and I'm reading a corrected ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9086)|
| 2:31:32| This is an ordinance of Knox County amending Knox County Code Chapter 54 by adding a new article for entitled sidewalk construction standards for the new commercial developments and residential developments greater than five lots to establish the location requirements and general specifications for the installation of sidewalks and all new developments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9092)|
| 2:31:53| or redevelopments permitted in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9113)|
| 2:31:57| This is ordinance 0-19-12-101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9117)|
| 2:32:03| Motion to send without recommendation, but I'd like to have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9123)|
| 2:32:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9126)|
| 2:32:07| We have a motion to send forward no recommendation from Commissioner Anders to the second from Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9127)|
| 2:32:11| That is the proper motion as this is an ordinance, and there's some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9131)|
| 2:32:15| I mean, Commissioner Bussler, did you all say you wanted to discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9135)|
| 2:32:18| He just said second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9138)|
| 2:32:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9139)|
| 2:32:20| Is there any discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9140)|
| 2:32:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9143)|
| 2:32:24| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9144)|
| 2:32:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9145)|
| 2:32:26| I want to compliment Jim and his team and staff for coming and asking us to come and meet individually to discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9146)|
| 2:32:34| I think it's important, and the way it was explained to me and the way I understand it is the MPC has taken it upon themselves to or is using authority that they feel like they have to tell us and landowners where to put sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9154)|
| 2:32:56| And inside the city, it's quite the opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9176)|
| 2:32:59| The city gets to pick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9179)|
| 2:33:00| Of course, there's a lot of differences there, but if we're never going to connect some of these neighborhoods, no plans and no money to do so, and we're making them construct a 26-foot roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9180)|
| 2:33:14| We believe that neighborhoods are safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9194)|
| 2:33:17| Now, if the market calls for it and they choose to do it, and we've got that option, they've got that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9197)|
| 2:33:22| But to force this cost onto a new homeowner and the future cost to the county to maintain these sidewalks, I really appreciate Jim for bringing this to us, and hopefully this will control our cost moving down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9202)|
| 2:33:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9217)|
| 2:33:38| Thanks, Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9218)|
| 2:33:39| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9219)|
| 2:33:40| Mr. Stone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9220)|
| 2:33:44| How are you, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9224)|
| 2:33:45| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9225)|
| 2:33:46| You got my painting done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9226)|
| 2:33:48| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9228)|
| 2:33:49| You got my painting done yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9229)|
| 2:33:50| Not yet, but it's on the to-do list tomorrow, weather permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9230)|
| 2:33:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9234)|
| 2:33:55| Section A, page 2, down there at the bottom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9235)|
| 2:33:59| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9239)|
| 2:34:00| All developers of real property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9240)|
| 2:34:02| We've got a quarter mile of public facilities, quarter mile of commercial facilities, convenience stores, centers, quarter mile of established pedestrian facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9242)|
| 2:34:14| You and I discussed, and I do echo Commissioner Anders, that it's wonderful that we had some communication there, meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9254)|
| 2:34:24| I think Highland View, the Schuler development up there is going to have to have sidewalks put in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9264)|
| 2:34:31| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9271)|
| 2:34:32| That was a MPC requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9272)|
| 2:34:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9274)|
| 2:34:35| You know, I'm for sidewalks, but I'm also not for sidewalks if it's not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9275)|
| 2:34:42| And that being way out in the middle of the rural area, do you see that as being a subdivision that should have sidewalks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9282)|
| 2:34:52| In that particular one, I believe it's Highland Ridge, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9292)|
| 2:34:55| We actually, that kind of goes to Commissioner Anders' point, we actually recommended against that, and the Planning Commission body chose to add that as a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9295)|
| 2:35:07| It's a little over a mile of sidewalks that doesn't connect to anything, and we don't anticipate it to connect to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9307)|
| 2:35:14| One of the things that if passed, this ordinance could possibly do, if that gentleman wishes to, he could possibly go back to Planning Commission and ask for that condition to be removed, potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9314)|
| 2:35:27| That would be an option of his, should this ordinance pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9327)|
| 2:35:31| The way that land lays, you know, you've got to go down the hill and through some little ridges and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9331)|
| 2:35:36| It's not, I'm not saying it would be nice, it's a amenity, you know, for a sidewalk in there, but that would be one of the ones that I would look at and say, I don't know about a sidewalk there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9336)|
| 2:35:51| But then you take Sevier Meadows there on Maryville Pike, across from Darryl's Gardens, yeah, that was, you know, we're within 600 feet of the I.C. King Park new entrance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9351)|
| 2:36:01| Yeah, we need, so, just want to make sure that we do this wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9361)|
| 2:36:07| Correct, sir, and that's what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9367)|
| 2:36:09| We want to be selective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9369)|
| 2:36:11| When I talked to you the other day, I mean, we've got $14 million of ADA liability in residential streets, subdivision sidewalks, and we just want to be very selective to where we choose those sidewalks in the most cost-effective means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9371)|
| 2:36:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9386)|
| 2:36:27| All right, thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9387)|
| 2:36:29| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9389)|
| 2:36:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9390)|
| 2:36:32| Mr., excuse me, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9392)|
| 2:36:37| Just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9397)|
| 2:36:39| On condo associations that have private roads with sidewalks, at some point, if they decided to have those turned over for county roads, would then we have to assume they're sidewalks, or would those sidewalks have to be ADA compliant at the time that they would be turned over to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9399)|
| 2:37:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9421)|
| 2:37:02| We would only accept them if they were compliant with ADA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9422)|
| 2:37:05| That's something we, you know, if we get that request, we go out and actually audit or inventory their right-of-way facilities, and we will not accept it unless they are brought up to our current standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9425)|
| 2:37:17| Okay, and on your document, you said the total dollar amount of sidewalks in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9437)|
| 2:37:22| Was that kind of just a guesstimate, or do you actually know how many sidewalks that you have to maintain in Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9442)|
| 2:37:30| No, that ADA transition plan that we recently completed codified the lends and the cost for the maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9450)|
| 2:37:38| So $14 million is just in residential streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9458)|
| 2:37:42| We have a total of approximately $45 million, including all public streets that have sidewalks on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9462)|
| 2:37:48| So we've got $45 million of work that ultimately we're going to have to do to make repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9468)|
| 2:37:54| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9474)|
| 2:37:57| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9477)|
| 2:37:58| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9478)|
| 2:37:59| Yeah, just a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9479)|
| 2:38:00| 43 and 44, are we going to have to have a public meeting on these since they are ordinances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9480)|
| 2:38:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9486)|
| 2:38:07| Okay, is there any other discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9487)|
| 2:38:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9493)|
| 2:38:14| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9494)|
| 2:38:16| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9496)|
| 2:38:17| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9497)|
| 2:38:18| Okay, the ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9498)|
| 2:38:19| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9499)|
| 2:38:21| Item number 44.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9501)|
| 2:38:25| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9505)|
| 2:38:26| Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9506)|
| 2:38:27| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9507)|
| 2:38:28| Yes, go ahead, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9508)|
| 2:38:29| Sorry, I wasn't sure exactly the appropriate time to jump in there, so I appreciate Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9509)|
| 2:38:32| We did make just a couple of minor brief changes to the document since we met with you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9512)|
| 2:38:39| and I just wanted to kind of clarify those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9519)|
| 2:38:41| One is which the – we had language regarding all new developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9521)|
| 2:38:46| We wanted to clarify that to state that, you know, if you're subdividing one lot like the one on –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9526)|
| 2:38:52| Mr. Anders talked the other day about Henderson Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9532)|
| 2:38:54| That's certainly – that in the eyes of this document could possibly be conceived as such,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9534)|
| 2:38:59| so we're going to say that you have to be a major subdivision or you have to be creating six or more lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9539)|
| 2:39:05| so we're just kind of clarifying that to make sure that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9545)|
| 2:39:08| one lot individual landowner doesn't get stuck with that requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9548)|
| 2:39:12| And then we added Section D just in regard to some comments with the law director just to kind of clarify some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9552)|
| 2:39:18| So there are some minor changes there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9558)|
| 2:39:21| So I just did want to make you aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9561)|
| 2:39:23| And we also have the maps that we talked about that we got the capital projects updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9563)|
| 2:39:29| that include the capital projects for the city, the town of Farragut, TDOT, and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9569)|
| 2:39:34| as well as the general plan map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9574)|
| 2:39:36| So we have those that we'll hand out here in a few minutes as well, so I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9576)|
| 2:39:40| Yeah, thank you, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9580)|
| 2:39:43| Okay, yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9583)|
| 2:39:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9585)|
| 2:39:46| Mr. Snowden?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9586)|
| 2:39:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9587)|
| 2:39:49| I, too, appreciate you looking at this because there were expenses that were going to be placed upon us for future maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9589)|
| 2:39:55| that might not have achieved our objective of walkability and connectivity within our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9595)|
| 2:40:01| But I did want to go back to what you were just talking about, the six lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9601)|
| 2:40:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9606)|
| 2:40:07| What if we have places that, you know, you take 100 acres and you divide it into six tracks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9607)|
| 2:40:13| Now, that doesn't sound like a very feasible place to be putting sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9613)|
| 2:40:16| That particular situation wouldn't necessarily require because that would be an exempt plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9616)|
| 2:40:23| And any subdivision of land over five acres that adjoins a public road is an exempt plat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9623)|
| 2:40:30| It don't even go through the Planning Commission, so those large acre tracks would not go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9630)|
| 2:40:34| It would be PR and RA and RB stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9634)|
| 2:40:38| So that location you're talking about wouldn't necessarily apply because of the land acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9638)|
| 2:40:43| Okay, thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9643)|
| 2:40:45| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9645)|
| 2:40:46| All right, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9646)|
| 2:40:49| Item number 44 is an ordinance amending Knox County Code Appendix A, Zoning Article 6,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9649)|
| 2:40:55| by adding a new section 6.80 to create a plan development approval process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9655)|
| 2:41:02| Ordinance number 0-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990, as amended on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9662)|
| 2:41:11| Okay, may I have a motion, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9671)|
| 2:41:13| I have a motion to approve without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9673)|
| 2:41:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9675)|
| 2:41:16| Okay, we have a motion to send forward with no recommendation from Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9676)|
| 2:41:19| with a second from Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9679)|
| 2:41:21| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9681)|
| 2:41:24| Okay, yes, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9684)|
| 2:41:27| I'm just checking the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9687)|
| 2:41:28| Okay, all right, it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9688)|
| 2:41:29| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9689)|
| 2:41:31| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9691)|
| 2:41:33| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9693)|
| 2:41:34| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9694)|
| 2:41:35| Nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9695)|
| 2:41:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9696)|

| 2:41:38| Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9698)|
| 2:41:40| Item number 45 is an ordinance amending the Knox County Code Appendix A, Zoning Article 2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9700)|
| 2:41:45| Section 2.20, Pacific Terms, Article 5, Section 5.38.03.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9705)|
| 2:41:53| Use is permitted on review in Article 4 to add a new section 4.106,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9713)|
| 2:41:58| standards for the new use on review approval of microbreweries in the CN neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9718)|
| 2:42:05| and subsection 4.106.01, minimum requirements to define microbreweries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9725)|
| 2:42:12| and identify them as a use subject to use on review approval in the CN neighborhood commercial district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9732)|
| 2:42:21| This is Ordinance O-90-9-130, adopted September 10, 1990, as amended on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9741)|
| 2:42:30| This is Ordinance 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9750)|
| 2:42:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9753)|
| 2:42:34| Okay, we have a motion to send forward no recommendation from Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9754)|
| 2:42:38| with a second by Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9758)|
| 2:42:41| I think he may have beat Commissioner Busler on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9761)|
| 2:42:44| Before we have the vote, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9764)|
| 2:42:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9766)|
| 2:42:48| I'd like to ask for Gerald Green to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9768)|
| 2:43:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9783)|
| 2:43:05| Do you want to give your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9785)|
| 2:43:06| Gerald Green, 400 West Main Street, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9786)|
| 2:43:10| Thanks, Gerald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9790)|
| 2:43:12| You were discussing earlier that in the process of doing this amendment that we didn't contemplate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9792)|
| 2:43:19| that maybe we should have operating hours associated with this because of the type of business that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9799)|
| 2:43:28| So you had said that maybe something like weekdays, I don't know, a starting time, 8 or 9 a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9808)|
| 2:43:36| but concluding at, say, 10 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9816)|
| 2:43:39| 10 p.m., excuse me, and on the weekends, 11 p.m., because this backs up to neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9819)|
| 2:43:45| Yes, and I think that would be reasonable, and it could be added as one of the use of reduced standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9825)|
| 2:43:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9830)|
| 2:43:54| So I would need to make a motion to add language to this, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9834)|
| 2:44:01| Well, I'll wait until the discussion ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9841)|
| 2:44:03| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9843)|
| 2:44:04| Everybody's lights came on at about the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9844)|
| 2:44:07| Commissioner, I'll go ahead and start with Commissioner Gill, Smith, Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9847)|
| 2:44:11| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9851)|
| 2:44:12| But there are breweries right now that have hours longer than this that are in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9852)|
| 2:44:18| And not a neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9858)|
| 2:44:20| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9860)|
| 2:44:22| But then how would you, I appreciate that it's in the city, but how would you make a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9862)|
| 2:44:29| one for the city and a separate one for the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9869)|
| 2:44:32| This would not affect the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9872)|
| 2:44:33| It would only be in the half-dozen or so commercial in the county, outside the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9873)|
| 2:44:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9879)|
| 2:44:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9880)|
| 2:44:41| And so one would be where Commissioner Anders' district is with the new brewery there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9881)|
| 2:44:45| And one, they actually started with one in my district is where it originated from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9885)|
| 2:44:49| But like, and I'm sorry, I wasn't recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9889)|
| 2:44:52| But anyway, Gerald's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9892)|
| 2:44:54| There's only a handful of neighborhood commercial districts in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9894)|
| 2:44:58| And so that's why we need to be very careful to not go overboard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9898)|
| 2:45:02| Hours are now even open later than 11 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9902)|
| 2:45:05| They're not allowed at all right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9905)|
| 2:45:07| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9907)|
| 2:45:08| But that then will impact the level of business that people would come to participate in a brewery even at midnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9908)|
| 2:45:17| I'm just saying, you have to acknowledge that if I'm going out, I'm going to be in a brewery not at 11 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9917)|
| 2:45:25| Yeah, but this is a little bit different because of the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9925)|
| 2:45:28| You know, that it's not, you know, it's not a commercial node or a major corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9928)|
| 2:45:34| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9934)|
| 2:45:35| But this still impacts the old blue laws that we are trying to at least put to bed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9935)|
| 2:45:42| And I think I can have a beer even in a residential area after Atlanta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9942)|
| 2:45:52| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9952)|
| 2:45:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9953)|
| 2:45:55| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9955)|
| 2:45:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9957)|
| 2:45:58| Director Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9958)|
| 2:46:01| The use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9961)|
| 2:46:03| If somebody applies for a use on review and they meet all the criteria of design, and that's a lot of it, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9963)|
| 2:46:14| You cannot turn them down if a neighborhood doesn't want this in their neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9974)|
| 2:46:18| That is not correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9978)|
| 2:46:20| The use on review is a special review process, and the Planning Commission has the ability to turn a use down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9980)|
| 2:46:26| even if it meets all the stated standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9986)|
| 2:46:28| If it does not meet the general standard of being compatible with the area in which it's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9988)|
| 2:46:33| So if there's a number of concerns about the use and its impact on the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9993)|
| 2:46:38| the Planning Commission has the authority to deny the use on review approval even if all the other standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=9998)|
| 2:46:45| because of those general standards relating to being compatible with the area in which it is proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10005)|
| 2:46:51| I thought whenever the city was looking at the use on review for the Helen Ross McNabb Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10011)|
| 2:46:57| they were instructed that if it met all the designs, there was no way they could turn it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10017)|
| 2:47:02| They were instructed if it met all the standards for use on review, which includes compatibility with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10022)|
| 2:47:08| Okay, and that's, I guess, what I just asked you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10028)|
| 2:47:10| If the neighborhood feels it's not compatible, who makes that call?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10030)|
| 2:47:13| The Planning Commission or in the case of the Helen Ross McNabb Center was appealed, it was the City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10033)|
| 2:47:20| Okay, so did you, you had mentioned last time where these locations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10040)|
| 2:47:27| Is there a specific reason why we are wanting to use neighborhood commercial locations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10047)|
| 2:47:34| as opposed to our general commercial zonings to allow these type of establishments in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10054)|
| 2:47:39| They're already allowed in most of the commercial, general commercial zoning districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10059)|
| 2:47:43| The request, it was a request from a member of the public for the planning staff to prepare an ordinance amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10063)|
| 2:47:52| for review by the Planning Commission and this council or commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10072)|
| 2:47:55| and that was the reason the neighborhood commercial was identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10075)|
| 2:47:58| That was the request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10078)|
| 2:48:00| Okay, so we do have other zones that these type of establishments can go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10080)|
| 2:48:04| They're already zoned, the CB, the CA, all the other commercial zoning districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10084)|
| 2:48:09| but the use is without special review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10089)|
| 2:48:12| They are permitted by right in those districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10092)|
| 2:48:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10096)|
| 2:48:18| All right, thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10098)|
| 2:48:20| Commissioner Anderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10100)|
| 2:48:21| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10101)|
| 2:48:22| In regards to Commissioner Schoonmaker, I've got a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10102)|
| 2:48:29| Do we have the authority to regulate beer in zones?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10109)|
| 2:48:35| According to state law, do we have the authority to regulate time served in one zone versus another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10115)|
| 2:48:41| I don't like beer, but do we have the authority to regulate the times it can be sold on one piece of property versus another?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10121)|
| 2:48:49| I think the only thing that gives us the power to regulate beer is under the beer ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10129)|
| 2:48:55| and that deals with distance, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10135)|
| 2:48:58| and compatibility with certain institutions within those distances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10138)|
| 2:49:04| And if they comply with that, then you issue them a license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10144)|
| 2:49:09| which gives them the power to be open in certain times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10149)|
| 2:49:13| And that's regulated by state law, not a zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10153)|
| 2:49:16| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10156)|
| 2:49:17| Can you research that between, number one, I think it's a significant change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10157)|
| 2:49:21| and, number two, I don't think we legally can regulate times of businesses in zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10161)|
| 2:49:26| I think you're right, but I'll check on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10166)|
| 2:49:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10168)|
| 2:49:30| One clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10170)|
| 2:49:32| Mr. Law Director, what is that distance that you speak of from residential or church?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10172)|
| 2:49:42| There's several items that are excluded unless you have a liquor by the drink license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10182)|
| 2:49:48| and then it's superseded by state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10188)|
| 2:49:50| That's the question that we're saying here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10190)|
| 2:49:52| Does state law supersede these rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10192)|
| 2:49:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10195)|
| 2:49:56| And the state law, it doesn't have zoning issues like neighborhood commercials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10196)|
| 2:50:01| So if somebody applied for a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10201)|
| 2:50:05| if we have a zoning where they can get a beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10205)|
| 2:50:09| they can also apply for a liquor permit at that same address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10209)|
| 2:50:13| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10213)|
| 2:50:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10215)|
| 2:50:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10216)|
| 2:50:17| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10217)|
| 2:50:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10220)|
| 2:50:22| Mr. Green, are you aware of any other business that we regulate the time based upon their zoning and use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10222)|
| 2:50:30| Not offhand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10230)|
| 2:50:31| I'll research that for next week and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10231)|
| 2:50:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10233)|
| 2:50:34| I would tag that onto Commissioner Anders' question of does this body have the authority to regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10234)|
| 2:50:40| when somebody can operate a business and under what time and serve what thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10240)|
| 2:50:46| I guess tagging onto Commissioner Jay, the simple question is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10246)|
| 2:50:51| if you've got a restaurant there, how late can it stay open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10251)|
| 2:50:54| And the difference is you've got a restaurant that has brewery equipment in it versus one that doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10254)|
| 2:50:59| And what are the standards for how late they can stay open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10259)|
| 2:51:05| Two in the morning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10265)|
| 2:51:06| I don't think they're regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10266)|
| 2:51:10| Three o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10270)|
| 2:51:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10271)|
| 2:51:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10272)|
| 2:51:13| But moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10273)|
| 2:51:14| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10274)|
| 2:51:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10275)|
| 2:51:17| To answer Randy's question, we've got a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10277)|
| 2:51:21| We have an issue in South Knoxville where there's one that got a state liquor license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10281)|
| 2:51:27| and I can't throw a baseball very far anymore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10287)|
| 2:51:31| but I can throw a baseball from the elementary school and hit the side of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10291)|
| 2:51:36| And they got around it by getting a liquor license from the state, which has created some problems there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10296)|
| 2:51:43| Use on review, that would go or appeal would be going to BZA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10303)|
| 2:51:48| Use on review is a BZA, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10308)|
| 2:51:52| So it would be a BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10312)|
| 2:51:54| I just want to confirm that, that if someone is turned down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10314)|
| 2:51:59| it can always be appealed to use on review at BZA, then to the court, Chancery Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10319)|
| 2:52:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10326)|
| 2:52:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10327)|
| 2:52:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10328)|

| 2:53:04| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10384)|
| 2:53:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10385)|
| 2:53:06| What this is coming up here for is for next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10386)|
| 2:53:08| I would like to see whether you want this demonstration done at the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10388)|
| 2:53:14| or at the regular meeting and because it will be streaming online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10394)|
| 2:53:19| and do I hear any recommendations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10399)|
| 2:53:22| Workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10402)|
| 2:53:23| Workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10403)|
| 2:53:24| I don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10404)|
| 2:53:26| Anybody want to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10406)|
| 2:53:27| Do you want to do it before the workshop or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10407)|
| 2:53:30| I mean, we've got, we always seem to have, just by speaking just my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10410)|
| 2:53:33| not as chair, but, I mean, we do have two hours for a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10413)|
| 2:53:36| You know, I don't know how January agenda is going to look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10416)|
| 2:53:39| but it's usually somewhat lighter than later in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10419)|
| 2:53:42| I mean, I just assume doing it at workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10422)|
| 2:53:44| I don't know if it warrants a special meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10424)|
| 2:53:46| but I think we could easily find 30 minutes of workshop for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10426)|
| 2:53:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10428)|
| 2:53:49| They're going to do live streaming to where we can put it on our computers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10429)|
| 2:53:54| and show how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10434)|
| 2:53:55| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10435)|
| 2:53:56| Well, there will be a person here as well in addition to the live stream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10436)|
| 2:53:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10439)|
| 2:54:00| It will be from Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10440)|
| 2:54:02| Yeah, that's why we might want to do it at 430 prior to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10442)|
| 2:54:05| just because then there's no other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10445)|
| 2:54:07| They can just say 430.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10447)|
| 2:54:08| They go online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10448)|
| 2:54:09| Boom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10449)|
| 2:54:10| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10450)|
| 2:54:11| And then we'll still have a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10451)|
| 2:54:16| No, there's an audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10456)|
| 2:54:17| It's starting at 2 o'clock, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10457)|
| 2:54:19| Ooh, that'll be the capital, won't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10459)|
| 2:54:23| Yeah, that might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10463)|
| 2:54:24| Yeah, that could run long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10464)|
| 2:54:26| You know, remember, the purpose of a work session is to work through these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10466)|
| 2:54:29| kind of things, you know, like we did tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10469)|
| 2:54:31| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10471)|
| 2:54:32| this would be something that could be pretty life changing for county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10472)|
| 2:54:35| commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10475)|
| 2:54:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10476)|
| 2:54:37| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10477)|
| 2:54:38| we could I'd rather leave a little bit of gap if we're working on a cap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10478)|
| 2:54:40| or at finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10480)|
| 2:54:41| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10481)|
| 2:54:42| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10482)|
| 2:54:43| Any other thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10483)|
| 2:54:45| I mean, if you did a commission day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10485)|
| 2:54:47| the only thing we don't know how long the beer board is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10487)|
| 2:54:49| you could do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10489)|
| 2:54:50| We've got one item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10490)|
| 2:54:51| Well, one item for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10491)|
| 2:54:53| Or that's excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10493)|
| 2:54:55| That's for this next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10495)|
| 2:54:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10496)|
| 2:54:58| Well, I tell you how we could probably handle this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10498)|
| 2:55:02| We would know, Miss Daly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10502)|
| 2:55:04| how soon would the deadline be for the beer board for January?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10504)|
| 2:55:08| You could let us know if there are so many applications or no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10508)|
| 2:55:11| applications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10511)|
| 2:55:12| and then we could set a time based on that and have it between beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10512)|
| 2:55:15| board and commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10515)|
| 2:55:18| So, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10518)|
| 2:55:21| Well, let's bottom line is we'll plan on doing it in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10521)|
| 2:55:26| When is the deadline that we need to get back to the vendor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10526)|
| 2:55:29| Well, I just need to give him, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10529)|
| 2:55:32| a couple of three days notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10532)|
| 2:55:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10534)|
| 2:55:35| And make sure he's available and just tell him it's going to be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10535)|
| 2:55:38| this date and I'll give him the hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10538)|
| 2:55:40| I would think by the agenda setting meeting a week out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10540)|
| 2:55:43| we will know before then if we've got anything coming before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10543)|
| 2:55:46| beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10546)|
| 2:55:47| We could probably confirm that Monday out or so when we do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10547)|
| 2:55:49| agenda setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10549)|
| 2:55:50| Like I said, I just need the time to tell him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10550)|
| 2:55:52| Work sessions on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10552)|
| 2:55:53| Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10553)|
| 2:55:54| Or in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10554)|
| 2:55:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10555)|
| 2:55:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10556)|
| 2:55:59| So what I'm hearing is we've got an agreement to do this based on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10559)|
| 2:56:05| depending on how the beer board is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10565)|
| 2:56:06| we could use it and slide it into the beer board meeting time for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10566)|
| 2:56:09| period, which would be day of commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10569)|
| 2:56:11| or we could put it in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10571)|
| 2:56:13| If it looks like a meteor agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10573)|
| 2:56:15| we could put this in the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10575)|
| 2:56:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10577)|
| 2:56:18| Just let me know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10578)|
| 2:56:19| Like, this is where I can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10579)|
| 2:56:21| I'm going to look to Drusilla too to help kind of keep me on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10581)|
| 2:56:23| track on that one as we tighten that up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10583)|
| 2:56:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10586)|
| 2:56:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10587)|
| 2:56:28| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10588)|
| 2:56:30| I'll be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10590)|
| 2:56:33| I want to get this out here and then give this a little bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10593)|
| 2:56:35| a lot more energy next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10595)|
| 2:56:37| And we can also go back and forth as we've done before on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10597)|
| 2:56:40| forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10600)|
| 2:56:41| We have a joint meeting with the school board and our legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10601)|
| 2:56:46| scheduled for when I say meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10606)|
| 2:56:48| that's not quite a meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10608)|
| 2:56:50| It's a luncheon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10610)|
| 2:56:51| The plan is for us to meet with the legislators at 11,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10611)|
| 2:56:55| then roll into lunch with the legislators and the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10615)|
| 2:56:59| and then after lunch or through the tail end of lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10619)|
| 2:57:02| they'll be visiting with the members of the Knox County School| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10622)|
| 2:57:04| Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10624)|
| 2:57:05| Historically, we've usually brought two or three items that were of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10625)|
| 2:57:09| importance to this body that we thought the legislature could help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10629)|
| 2:57:13| us with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10633)|
| 2:57:14| And I just kind of want to throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10634)|
| 2:57:18| If you guys would like to discuss a few items tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10638)|
| 2:57:21| we can also have everybody post these on the forum and try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10641)|
| 2:57:26| compile some of them there, as we've done in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10646)|
| 2:57:28| and then try to finalize that a little bit at the meeting next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10648)|
| 2:57:31| week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10651)|
| 2:57:32| If we need additional finalization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10652)|
| 2:57:34| we can continue to do that through the forum going into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10654)|
| 2:57:36| meeting, which is kind of what we've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10656)|
| 2:57:38| But go ahead, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10658)|
| 2:57:40| Can I just tell you three statewide initiatives that we just need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10660)|
| 2:57:44| to just re-educate them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10664)|
| 2:57:47| One will be the sales tax administration fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10667)|
| 2:57:50| The second will be the single item sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10670)|
| 2:57:55| single article sales tax, which is where if you buy a $5,000 item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10675)|
| 2:58:03| as an example, the first $1,600 are taxed at 9.25%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10683)|
| 2:58:09| where the state gets 7%, and Knox County or the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10689)|
| 2:58:13| wherever you purchase it in, gets the 2.25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10693)|
| 2:58:16| The next $1,600 is taxed at 9.25%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10696)|
| 2:58:22| 7% goes to the state, and the 2.25% goes to the state as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10702)|
| 2:58:28| So the counties and the cities are saying that additional 2.25%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10708)|
| 2:58:35| should revert back to the county or to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10715)|
| 2:58:39| And then, of course, it doesn't affect the consumer at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10719)|
| 2:58:42| And then the balance, anything over $3,200,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10722)|
| 2:58:45| is taxed at the 7% Tennessee rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10725)|
| 2:58:49| So that's coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10729)|
| 2:58:51| And that's a joint thing between counties and the Municipal League.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10731)|
| 2:58:57| Does everybody understand what I'm talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10737)|
| 2:58:59| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10739)|
| 2:59:00| What might be helpful would be to write that out in the forum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10740)|
| 2:59:03| and also, when we get to the brass tacks on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10743)|
| 2:59:06| I wonder if a proper statement from us could be to the legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10746)|
| 2:59:10| is we support the position of the Tennessee County Commission Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10750)|
| 2:59:14| and the Municipal League on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10754)|
| 2:59:16| So rather than just laying out everything in detail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10756)|
| 2:59:18| they're probably going to hear it from those two lobbying bodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10758)|
| 2:59:22| So we could do that and maybe come out in support of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10762)|
| 2:59:28| what our municipal legislative lobbyists are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10768)|
| 2:59:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10771)|
| 2:59:32| And then the bill that's still filed is to restore the full 5% fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10772)|
| 2:59:37| to the Register of Deeds Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10777)|
| 2:59:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10781)|
| 2:59:42| Thank you, Commissioner Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10782)|
| 2:59:43| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10783)|
| 2:59:45| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10785)|
| 2:59:47| Commissioner Skinmaker, I think those are things that every county commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10787)|
| 2:59:52| and city council person are going to be pushing on the legislature to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10792)|
| 2:59:56| I would like to see us work on things that are unique to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10796)|
| 3:00:00| things that might actually take a private act to get through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10800)|
| 3:00:04| I mean, we can support those things, wholeheartedly support those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10804)|
| 3:00:07| but I think to go to our legislators with just things that everybody's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10807)|
| 3:00:12| supporting is a waste of an opportunity to try to get some of the uniquely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10812)|
| 3:00:17| different things that we as being one of the big four experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10817)|
| 3:00:21| because we all know we get wrapped up in a lot of the all-in-one policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10821)|
| 3:00:25| that the state passes that doesn't necessarily fit us or work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10825)|
| 3:00:29| So I think we should kind of concentrate on the type of things that we would want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10829)|
| 3:00:32| them to do in a private act for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10832)|
| 3:00:35| With that said, knowing that you all can post some of these into our forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10835)|
| 3:00:41| are there any private actions that we might want to at least throw on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10841)|
| 3:00:47| tonight just to briefly cover?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10847)|
| 3:00:49| I know the meeting's long in the tooth, and we're not going to debate them at length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10849)|
| 3:00:52| We can do that next week, but do you want to do a preview of our debate for next week?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10852)|
| 3:00:56| This is half-heartedly, and I hope that Commissioner Daley doesn't come over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10856)|
| 3:01:00| and hit me, but I'm thinking chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10860)|
| 3:01:02| I'm up to three eggs a day now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10862)|
| 3:01:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10868)|
| 3:01:10| But there are a few that I will bring in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10870)|
| 3:01:13| You are the chickens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10873)|
| 3:01:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10874)|
| 3:01:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10875)|
| 3:01:16| Go ahead, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10876)|
| 3:01:18| I'm not sure where this fits in the state, but one question I asked when I was having my meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10878)|
| 3:01:24| with Engineering and Public Works when we were talking about projects and infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10884)|
| 3:01:28| and sidewalks and everything else, was I asked them the same question I might ask you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10888)|
| 3:01:34| and the state legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10894)|
| 3:01:37| Has anybody ever asked if we could get the state to give us back the roads or give us roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10897)|
| 3:01:44| We talk about infrastructure all the time, and we talk about how we are essentially limited by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10904)|
| 3:01:49| we have these old country roads that are state highways, and we don't have the ability to adapt those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10909)|
| 3:01:55| One of the things that Engineering and Public Works said that was really interesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10915)|
| 3:01:59| the legal agreement between the city of Knoxville and the state is the city can decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10919)|
| 3:02:05| they want to put a traffic light anywhere they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10925)|
| 3:02:08| They do it, and they invest the money, and they put it up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10928)|
| 3:02:11| They don't have to ask permission for the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10931)|
| 3:02:13| They have to file certain things, but they don't get the roadblock that we get on the county side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10933)|
| 3:02:18| Maybe it would be better explained by Jim, but we've talked a lot about infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10938)|
| 3:02:23| Tazeville Pike, Washington Pike, North Shore Drive, these areas that are state highways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10943)|
| 3:02:27| that we're essentially limited, and I just ask the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10947)|
| 3:02:30| has anybody ever asked the state could we take North Shore Drive, for instance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10950)|
| 3:02:34| and have it re-designated as a Knox County road, not a state highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10954)|
| 3:02:38| and allow us to invest in our own infrastructure without waiting for the glacial pace of capital projects?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10958)|
| 3:02:46| Just a question. Nobody's ever given me an answer whether you could do that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10966)|
| 3:02:50| I'm sure the state would be happy to give us the roads for us to maintain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10970)|
| 3:02:54| I believe there's some, in that agreement, and I may be totally wrong, and Bud may know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10974)|
| 3:02:59| in that agreement with the city and the state, the city gets more gas tax money to deal with some of those issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10979)|
| 3:03:05| and so it wouldn't be, and I would do research on that, but I think that there's an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10985)|
| 3:03:11| They annexed out to Straw Plains and Midway Road, and there's an agreement out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10991)|
| 3:03:15| and all those annexations on state roads, but I'm not sure if there's a money issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=10995)|
| 3:03:20| but I believe the city gets more money to maintain those roads, and I may be totally wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11000)|
| 3:03:24| but I think that was the agreement. Jim Snowden, maybe you have a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11004)|
| 3:03:27| Yeah, Tim, if you could weigh in on this one. This is, that's an extraordinarily big slice to swallow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11007)|
| 3:03:34| It is. It's just, it's a unique Knox County question, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11014)|
| 3:03:38| I was talking about how, the question I had to you all that I'm wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11018)|
| 3:03:43| if it's something we want to take to our state legislators is, does anybody ask the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11023)|
| 3:03:47| if we could have, if we could have the roads redesignated just as Knox County roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11027)|
| 3:03:51| and not as state highways, de-designate them, so to speak, and you would explain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11031)|
| 3:03:55| to how the city does not have the same restriction as the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11035)|
| 3:03:58| and I wonder if you could explain that a little bit here to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11038)|
| 3:04:00| Yeah, and that legislation's been around a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11040)|
| 3:04:03| I think it's primarily related to, you know, more rural counties that don't have an engineering department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11043)|
| 3:04:10| that could be competent to maintain those things, but you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11050)|
| 3:04:14| The city of Knoxville maintains, or, you know, pretty much every municipality has the ability to sign,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11054)|
| 3:04:20| and the TDOT encourages them to sign a maintenance agreement to where they maintain everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11060)|
| 3:04:26| within the state's right-of-way, and the state reimburses them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11066)|
| 3:04:30| The counties, Knox County, Blount County, every county doesn't have that ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11070)|
| 3:04:36| We cannot, you know, even if we wanted to engage in that agreement, we could not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11076)|
| 3:04:42| which does create, like you said, you know, we, if there's a signal on a state route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11082)|
| 3:04:47| if the city agrees with that signal, they can execute that signal, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11087)|
| 3:04:53| whether the state concurs or not, whereas we've got a location now that we're trying to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11093)|
| 3:04:59| with a gentleman where we think the signal is warranted, and the state has some concerns about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11099)|
| 3:05:04| but it's on a state route, so we technically can't, you know, the state has the ultimate say in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11104)|
| 3:05:10| So it does create for some unique conversations in regard to that legislation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11110)|
| 3:05:16| So it's been around a long time, and I think it's more suited for people that are, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11116)|
| 3:05:20| more rural counties that don't have the engineering staff like our department would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11120)|
| 3:05:25| As a home rural county with a charter, I just wonder if there's an opportunity for us to have a better relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11125)|
| 3:05:30| with TDOT that allows us to invest in more of our infrastructure on a timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11130)|
| 3:05:36| that would actually benefit the citizens of Knox County instead of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11136)|
| 3:05:41| getting in the line of the 127 projects that will get here someday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11141)|
| 3:05:45| There are big intersections, say Hardin Valley Road and Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11145)|
| 3:05:49| That is clearly a bigger Solway. That's clearly, you know, sort of major infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11149)|
| 3:05:54| But if you, you know, we've talked several times about Tazewell Pike, Washington Pike, and North Shore Drive specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11154)|
| 3:05:59| and how Engineering and Public Works has said, you know, we could add a turn lane here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11159)|
| 3:06:04| we could add some buffer here, we could do things that would alleviate some of the bottlenecks and congestions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11164)|
| 3:06:09| but for state designations, and so we're sort of handcuffed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11169)|
| 3:06:13| And I just wonder if anybody's brought that up or if this body's ever asked our state representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11173)|
| 3:06:18| Not that I'm aware of, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11178)|
| 3:06:21| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11181)|
| 3:06:23| Mr. Snowden, when you say the state turns over and reimburses for maintenance within the right-of-way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11183)|
| 3:06:31| how would that affect capital projects for expanding the roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11191)|
| 3:06:36| Because I think that's what he's ultimately getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11196)|
| 3:06:38| Would it give us a faster access to money to improve, not just maintain, but to improve these roads?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11198)|
| 3:06:47| In situations like that, it is more specific to maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11207)|
| 3:06:52| In situations where if we wanted to, let's say, widen a section of that route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11212)|
| 3:06:57| we would need to go through the TPO to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11217)|
| 3:07:02| because that is something that the state leverages federal dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11222)|
| 3:07:06| and those federal dollars have to be allocated amongst the region,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11226)|
| 3:07:09| and all those region partners need to have a say in how that money is spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11229)|
| 3:07:13| So there is a little distinction between maintenance and new or renovation construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11233)|
| 3:07:20| So it's more of maintenance money than capital money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11240)|
| 3:07:24| Correct. Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11244)|
| 3:07:28| Okay. Here's where I think we are reading the room here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11248)|
| 3:07:33| We're all probably going to have some ideas when we get home and do a little bit of independent research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11253)|
| 3:07:37| So what I want to encourage each of you all to do is I'll make a posting to the commission forum page that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11257)|
| 3:07:46| please reply to this with any of your ideas on this related to things we should encourage or direct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11266)|
| 3:07:53| and request our Knox County body to focus on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11273)|
| 3:07:58| Post that in the forum this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11278)|
| 3:08:00| We can come back to this next Monday on it and start to formalize it a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11280)|
| 3:08:06| I'd like to, Madam Clerk, I think that gets us to the end of the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11286)|
| 3:08:11| Is that correct, other than public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11291)|
| 3:08:14| And then we have a separate, that's a separate meeting, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11294)|
| 3:08:17| Okay. Is there anyone here who wishes to speak at public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11297)|
| 3:08:22| Bob, you've got to close this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11302)|
| 3:08:23| I am, I am, I am, but that's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11303)|
| 3:08:26| So, okay. I don't see anybody here. Commissioner Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11306)|
| 3:08:30| Yeah, I just wanted to, had a little bug back in the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11310)|
| 3:08:34| We had the jail study back in the summertime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11314)|
| 3:08:38| We don't need to let that die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11318)|
| 3:08:39| We need to, we need, if it's an hour special meeting or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11319)|
| 3:08:44| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11324)|
| 3:08:45| What I might do is I'm going to ask Mayor Jacobs, if you've got just about a minute or two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11325)|
| 3:08:49| what Commissioner Daly had just asked about was an update on the jail study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11329)|
| 3:08:54| Mayor Jacobs is chairing a judicial reform committee to go on a pretty deep path on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11334)|
| 3:09:00| and I know that one of the brief outcomes or statements out of that that came from the sheriff's office was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11340)|
| 3:09:05| there's a lot of, gosh, Mayor, I guess booking issues related to the way different people are classified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11345)|
| 3:09:12| that until we get those even fixed, I don't think they're quite ready to even talk about new jails yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11352)|
| 3:09:19| And Mayor Jacobs, if you would want to talk to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11359)|
| 3:09:21| And Commissioner Daly, you've mentioned to me multiple times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11361)|
| 3:09:24| but I've still been trying to wait until that committee had got a little bit more teeth into it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11364)|
| 3:09:27| before they gave us the report out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11367)|
| 3:09:28| But, Mayor, if you could speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11368)|
| 3:09:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11369)|
| 3:09:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11370)|
| 3:09:31| So, as you indicated, we received the report back, which had some startling findings and trend projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11371)|
| 3:09:40| And since that time, my office has put together a criminal justice advisory committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11380)|
| 3:09:49| and we've had a couple meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11389)|
| 3:09:52| That is expanding at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11392)|
| 3:09:55| We also have put together and are putting together subcommittees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11395)|
| 3:09:58| One will be a jail population subcommittee and also a committee to deal with mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11398)|
| 3:10:06| and how to divert the mentally ill from the criminal justice system and working on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11406)|
| 3:10:13| NACO, the National Association of Counties, sent today some information for Chairman Nystrom to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11413)|
| 3:10:22| They have an initiative that's called the Stepping Up Initiative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11422)|
| 3:10:25| and it deals specifically with reducing the number of mentally ill people in jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11425)|
| 3:10:31| So that will be coming before commission on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11431)|
| 3:10:35| And within that study, there were some quick wins, and those, of course, are things that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11435)|
| 3:10:42| As the chairman indicated, you know, one of the issues is just there's been a move instead of, you know, to issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11442)|
| 3:10:55| what a loss, instead of to arrest people with citations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11455)|
| 3:11:00| But according to state law, the issue with that is if there's a failure to appear from one citation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11460)|
| 3:11:06| if someone is then cited again, they have to go to jail, which actually is tying the sheriff's hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11466)|
| 3:11:14| And, you know, when we look at just our overall length of stay, the arrests are actually going down, trending down, which is a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11474)|
| 3:11:24| The problem is the average length of stay is trending up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11484)|
| 3:11:28| And our task is to determine how we can get that average length of stay to go down as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11488)|
| 3:11:38| But, you know, it's one of those things when we all get together, and I had no idea until the sheriff talked about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11498)|
| 3:11:45| and that's something that the legislature could change with essentially one sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11505)|
| 3:11:49| But, you know, there are things like that that are probably kind of flying under the radar that we need to fix,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11509)|
| 3:11:56| and we can, so we're just in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11516)|
| 3:12:00| And as I said, this advisory committee will now grow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11520)|
| 3:12:04| The first couple meetings, we're just kind of laying out a roadmap for some different things that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11524)|
| 3:12:10| So we're working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11530)|
| 3:12:13| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11533)|
| 3:12:14| And maybe what we can do is just have a report out from that, maybe if not January, then February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11534)|
| 3:12:20| and we'll make it a discussion item at the commission and drill down onto it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11540)|
| 3:12:24| Or if there's enough content, we could probably call a chairman's briefing on that subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11544)|
| 3:12:30| That would be fine. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11550)|
| 3:12:32| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11552)|
| 3:12:34| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11554)|
| 3:12:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11555)|
| 3:12:37| Okay. Any other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11557)|
| 3:12:40| No one here for a forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11560)|
| 3:12:42| Is there a motion to adjourn this meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11562)|
| 3:12:43| And don't leave because we have another one to do real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11563)|
| 3:12:47| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11567)|
| 3:12:49| All opposed, please say nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11569)|
| 3:12:51| This meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=11571)|
