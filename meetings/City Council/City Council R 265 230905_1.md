| 2:35:48| So at best it would be complaint driven, but that's for everybody else to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9348)|
| 2:35:56| The minimum lot area doesn't impact enforcement a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9356)|
| 2:36:01| I can tell you that the change of the rear setback from 10 feet to 5 feet makes sense operationally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9361)|
| 2:36:09| because Section 10.3A talks about accessory structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9369)|
| 2:36:14| We'll call it a garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9374)|
| 2:36:15| So somebody can have a garage that's 5 foot off the setback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9375)|
| 2:36:18| but if they convert that garage into an ADU, now they've got a variance that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9378)|
| 2:36:23| And we've seen many of those go through BZA where people have an existing structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9383)|
| 2:36:27| that's too close to the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9387)|
| 2:36:29| It meets for a garage, but it doesn't for an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9389)|
| 2:36:32| Does that make sense to everybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9392)|
| 2:36:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9395)|
| 2:36:38| Maximum gross floor area, it's also confusing for our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9398)|
| 2:36:45| The maximum gross floor area and the percentage of the primary dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9405)|
| 2:36:48| I actually was talking with others earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9408)|
| 2:36:52| I had a customer call me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9412)|
| 2:36:54| They've got a 7,500-square-foot lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9414)|
| 2:36:57| They want to build a 1,750-square-foot house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9417)|
| 2:37:00| They said, how tall can the ADU be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9420)|
| 2:37:02| We talked about that, and then they said, well, how big can it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9422)|
| 2:37:06| If you go to 10.3A, the maximum gross area for an accessory structure is 750 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9426)|
| 2:37:17| But then you go to an ADU, and it says you can have 800 square feet of gross floor area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9437)|
| 2:37:23| But then if you go to 10.3B9, based on the size of the house, it can only be 700 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9443)|
| 2:37:33| So there's a lot of variables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9453)|
| 2:37:36| I would love the opportunity to clean that up and regulate it in one manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9456)|
| 2:37:45| Other than that, the last item of changing the maximum height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9465)|
| 2:37:49| I don't like creating another level of inconsistency between a garage and an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9469)|
| 2:37:56| So I hope that answers your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9476)|
| 2:37:59| One of the reasons I wanted to hear from you is I, speaking to the sending it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9479)|
| 2:38:08| I wonder if we can talk about making an amendment to it that we feel comfortable with at this time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9488)|
| 2:38:17| perhaps just limiting these to the TDR area, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9497)|
| 2:38:23| Just a suggestion instead of just sending it back right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9503)|
| 2:38:29| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9509)|
| 2:38:32| Okay, so I'm going to try and stick to the track of commenting on sending it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9512)|
| 2:38:40| I will say I agree with the comments from Vice Mayor Roberto,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9520)|
| 2:38:44| and I would like to comment on what Councilwoman Singh just asked, if we make amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9524)|
| 2:38:50| Even if we make amendments, they still have to be vetted through the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9530)|
| 2:38:54| because they weren't vetted then at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9534)|
| 2:38:56| So they would have to go back anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9536)|
| 2:38:59| I think the way to address what you just brought up is potentially package it in the motion to send it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9539)|
| 2:39:06| to say send it back to the Planning Commission for review, for staff review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9546)|
| 2:39:13| and include X or Y or Z or all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9553)|
| 2:39:18| Okay, that's my thoughts, but I'm not an attorney, so we'll defer to our attorneys on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9558)|
| 2:39:22| if it's the will of the body here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9562)|
| 2:39:24| I do want to ask Ms. Brooks a question while we're talking about sending it back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9564)|
| 2:39:32| I think this is a little bit of an unusual situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9572)|
| 2:39:34| In my time in Knoxville, I don't think I've ever seen anything edited in this fashion by the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9574)|
| 2:39:43| and not vetted through the staff or based on a staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9583)|
| 2:39:47| I mean, have you seen that before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9587)|
| 2:39:50| I cannot recall that, per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9590)|
| 2:39:53| No, I can't recall during my time that we've had that come forward in that manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9593)|
| 2:39:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9598)|
| 2:40:00| For the reasons that Mr. Ahrens has stated in the various factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9600)|
| 2:40:05| there's very complex things about the setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9605)|
| 2:40:11| and the recommendations for middle housing that the city published.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9611)|
| 2:40:19| I know that staff from planning, staff from the building department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9619)|
| 2:40:24| like Mr. Berry, Mr. Ahrens, the engineering department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9624)|
| 2:40:27| have all been weighing in on the various changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9627)|
| 2:40:30| and not only does this need more public review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9630)|
| 2:40:35| it also needs staff review to make sure that there's consistency in the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9635)|
| 2:40:39| on things like heights and percentages and setbacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9639)|
| 2:40:43| and how it interacts with the code about garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9643)|
| 2:40:46| I know I have neighbors that have had to get a variance for a garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9646)|
| 2:40:52| and a variance for an ADU to build a brand-new garage with an ADU in it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9652)|
| 2:40:57| and those are things that I have been talking with staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9657)|
| 2:41:00| and I know that staff has looked at from the variance side to be corrected in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9660)|
| 2:41:07| So we will be serving everyone best by sending this back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9667)|
| 2:41:10| and having a full review of everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9670)|
| 2:41:14| And since we're only supposed to be talking about the motion to send it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9674)|
| 2:41:19| I will stop myself on that note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9679)|
| 2:41:22| Okay, Council Member Testerman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9682)|
| 2:41:25| Mr. Ahrens, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9685)|
| 2:41:32| So I, too, agree with sending this back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9692)|
| 2:41:35| and you may have just answered my question when you spoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9695)|
| 2:41:38| So there is no tracking of the number of ADUs that currently exist within the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9698)|
| 2:41:46| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9706)|
| 2:41:47| Even through the permitting process, there's not a way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9707)|
| 2:41:51| It would be a standard accessory structure or an alteration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9711)|
| 2:41:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9717)|
| 2:41:58| I just wanted to clarify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9718)|
| 2:41:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9719)|
| 2:42:02| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9722)|
| 2:42:04| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9724)|
| 2:42:06| Other than amendments we make, what value is there, I guess, Ms. Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9726)|
| 2:42:11| what value is there sending this back to planning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9731)|
| 2:42:18| I'm not sure that I can answer that, Council Member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9738)|
| 2:42:20| I would defer to you all in terms of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9740)|
| 2:42:22| If we don't make any amendments to it, you all have already considered this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9742)|
| 2:42:25| The Planning Commission has considered this, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9745)|
| 2:42:31| I may be missing something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9751)|
| 2:42:34| I think the Planning Commission considered this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9754)|
| 2:42:37| but it hadn't been reviewed or recommendation by staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9757)|
| 2:42:41| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9761)|
| 2:42:46| Planning Commission did have a fairly robust discussion about this particular item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9766)|
| 2:42:51| and there was a Planning Commissioner who introduced amendments to Mr. Marlowe's proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9771)|
| 2:42:58| and those were discussed as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9778)|
| 2:43:01| And then they took action on the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9781)|
| 2:43:07| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9787)|
| 2:43:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9788)|
| 2:43:09| Was it the planning staff?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9789)|
| 2:43:12| Did the planning staff, different from the planning commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9792)|
| 2:43:16| consider the proposed amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9796)|
| 2:43:19| They study it and make a recommendation, I think is what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9799)|
| 2:43:24| The amendment that was introduced during the meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9804)|
| 2:43:26| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9806)|
| 2:43:27| Is that the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9807)|
| 2:43:28| At the time that the staff had, they didn't review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9808)|
| 2:43:32| we did not review that in advance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9812)|
| 2:43:34| No, it was presented during the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9814)|
| 2:43:40| Council Member Smith, do you have further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9820)|
| 2:43:42| There's going to be one follow-up while I have the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9822)|
| 2:43:44| Mr. Ahrens, could you come back up again, get your steps in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9824)|
| 2:43:48| Did I hear you say you don't keep a list of ADUs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9828)|
| 2:43:52| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9832)|
| 2:43:53| Okay, but you have to permit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9833)|
| 2:43:55| We do permit them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9835)|
| 2:43:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9836)|
| 2:43:58| An accessory structure is an accessory structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9838)|
| 2:44:00| whether it's a garage or an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9840)|
| 2:44:02| Understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9842)|
| 2:44:03| But you have a list of permitted ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9843)|
| 2:44:06| We do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9846)|
| 2:44:09| They're lumped in with garages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9849)|
| 2:44:12| They're lumped in with storage sheds that are large enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9852)|
| 2:44:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9855)|
| 2:44:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9856)|
| 2:44:17| Vice Mayor Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9857)|
| 2:44:18| Oh, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9858)|
| 2:44:19| Yeah, and then I'll come back to you, Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9859)|
| 2:44:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9861)|
| 2:44:24| I fundamentally disagree with the notion that owner occupancy is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9864)|
| 2:44:28| difficult to enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9868)|
| 2:44:30| I think you just identified one of the problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9870)|
| 2:44:33| which is if you're not looking at something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9873)|
| 2:44:35| then how are you going to know whether you're enforcing it or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9875)|
| 2:44:39| Council had an extensive workshop on other issues where we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9879)|
| 2:44:43| enforcement, and we identified for staff how to take care of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9883)|
| 2:44:49| and those were implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9889)|
| 2:44:51| And that's a good model for dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9891)|
| 2:44:54| It is absolutely enforceable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9894)|
| 2:44:57| Director Ahrens brought up a very good point about why we need to send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9897)|
| 2:45:02| this back, which was he mentioned that he's found areas that he felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9902)|
| 2:45:06| like needed to get cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9906)|
| 2:45:10| So I do think it needs to go back for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9910)|
| 2:45:14| I'm definitely open to listening to ideas about amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9914)|
| 2:45:21| But my problem with what's going on in this particular proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9921)|
| 2:45:26| as well as amendments on the fly right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9926)|
| 2:45:29| is that we haven't provided for a transparent process with public notice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9929)|
| 2:45:34| about what's going on with regards to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9934)|
| 2:45:38| And there are other areas that need to get cleaned up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9938)|
| 2:45:41| So I think just in sending it back to planning so staff can make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9941)|
| 2:45:45| recommendation on it and Mr. Ahrens can join in that discussion and talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9945)|
| 2:45:49| to them, we may end up getting a product that's better for us to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9949)|
| 2:45:55| and can go through a public process that would be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9955)|
| 2:46:00| So my recommendation would be just to stick with the motion as is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9960)|
| 2:46:03| send it back, and go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9963)|
| 2:46:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9965)|
| 2:46:07| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9967)|
| 2:46:10| Yeah, I'm not particularly interested at this moment in my life on sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9970)|
| 2:46:14| here writing the ordinance on the fly with Mr. Ahrens' input tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9974)|
| 2:46:19| per se.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9979)|
| 2:46:22| But I want to ask a procedural question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9982)|
| 2:46:25| If we're making a motion to send it back to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9985)|
| 2:46:30| that is for the plans review or the plans come – are we making a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9990)|
| 2:46:37| for the planning commission to re-review what they wrote on the fly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=9997)|
| 2:46:41| How do we need to word the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10001)|
| 2:46:43| So normally what would happen is the administration or Mr. Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10003)|
| 2:46:48| when we've edited code, parts of recode, is Mr. Ahrens, Mr. Berry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10008)|
| 2:46:54| they deal with the same thing 20 times and they're like, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10014)|
| 2:46:57| here's a problem in the code that we've identified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10017)|
| 2:47:00| We'd like to make an edit to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10020)|
| 2:47:02| They propose that edit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10022)|
| 2:47:03| It's been vetted through them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10023)|
| 2:47:05| They bring it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10025)|
| 2:47:07| But this is like a reverse order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10027)|
| 2:47:09| No offense, Mr. Marlowe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10029)|
| 2:47:11| This is – we don't have a process for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10031)|
| 2:47:15| this being any citizen willing to pay the fee to be able to throw something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10035)|
| 2:47:19| out to the planning commission and the planning commission write it on the fly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10039)|
| 2:47:22| and send it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10042)|
| 2:47:23| It goes to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10043)|
| 2:47:24| They wrote it on the fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10044)|
| 2:47:26| We want the staff to review it and I want Mr. Ahrens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10046)|
| 2:47:29| and Mr. Berry to lay eyes on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10049)|
| 2:47:33| And so by sending it back to the planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10053)|
| 2:47:35| I'm not sure that that's what's happening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10055)|
| 2:47:37| even though I did second your motion I think or unless someone else did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10057)|
| 2:47:40| I honestly don't remember at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10060)|
| 2:47:42| I want us to get what we want out of this because this is not the order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10062)|
| 2:47:45| the normal order of operations and procedure for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10065)|
| 2:47:50| So if maybe Mr. Swanson or Ms. Brooks or Mr. Frost could advise us how to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10070)|
| 2:47:56| what we want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10076)|
| 2:47:57| I want Mr. Ahrens and Mr. Berry to add to their work plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10077)|
| 2:48:02| which is to review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10082)|
| 2:48:05| I appreciate the commissioners, but I don't think that that's all that we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10085)|
| 2:48:11| Sorry, I'm tired and grumpy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10091)|
| 2:48:13| If I may, I think if you simply make a motion to remand it to planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10093)|
| 2:48:21| and it goes back to planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10101)|
| 2:48:24| that's why we have the executive director of planning here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10104)|
| 2:48:27| to help them understand why it got sent back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10107)|
| 2:48:30| With this particular one, these are smart folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10110)|
| 2:48:33| Our planning staff are really smart folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10113)|
| 2:48:35| They'll know why it came back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10115)|
| 2:48:37| and they'll understand that they want you to explore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10117)|
| 2:48:40| all the possible options available and make the planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10120)|
| 2:48:47| then will make some recommendation of what they believe to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10127)|
| 2:48:51| the best solution to the problem to planning to the commissioners themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10131)|
| 2:48:58| and then the commissioners will do whatever they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10138)|
| 2:49:01| And you could end up with amendments on the fly again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10141)|
| 2:49:05| but I suspect probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10145)|
| 2:49:08| So I think the motion to remand will accomplish what you want to accomplish,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10148)|
| 2:49:14| but I would ask Amy if she agrees with that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10154)|
| 2:49:20| Yes, I agree with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10160)|
| 2:49:22| and we'll work with plans review and inspection based on the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10162)|
| 2:49:25| that you all have had this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10165)|
| 2:49:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10167)|
| 2:49:30| Council Member Smith and then Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10170)|
| 2:49:32| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10172)|
| 2:49:33| I think we just want to follow up on Councilman Ryder's comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10173)|
| 2:49:36| I think you highlighted a very important aspect of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10176)|
| 2:49:40| that it's kind of clumsy and it doesn't normally come to us this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10180)|
| 2:49:44| I also want to highlight that I know Mr. Marlowe has been raising this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10184)|
| 2:49:49| for some time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10189)|
| 2:49:50| and it's no secret that ADUs haven't happened at the rate that we expected them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10190)|
| 2:49:58| in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10198)|
| 2:49:59| Does it mean we shed all public forum or all public input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10199)|
| 2:50:03| I would say I should have said at the out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10203)|
| 2:50:05| there needs to be a lot more public input on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10205)|
| 2:50:07| However, the reason it's coming to us like this is because it hasn't been addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10207)|
| 2:50:11| and there's been multiple voices of concern that this has been stymied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10211)|
| 2:50:18| So we're here because this has not been picked up in an efficient manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10218)|
| 2:50:26| With that said, I'm fine with remanding it back to Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10226)|
| 2:50:31| and letting our expert planners take a crack at this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10231)|
| 2:50:35| although I can't miss the opportunity while we're here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10235)|
| 2:50:40| to provide some of my thoughts on this at the moment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10240)|
| 2:50:42| which is removing the lot size minimum and reducing setbacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10242)|
| 2:50:47| which I think are reasonable adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10247)|
| 2:50:51| I can't get on board at the moment with removing owner-occupied requirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10251)|
| 2:50:56| but, again, I think when you talk to enough folks in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10256)|
| 2:51:00| you may shape brains on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10260)|
| 2:51:02| So I think that's a question mark for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10262)|
| 2:51:04| and I have serious concerns about the increase in scale of an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10264)|
| 2:51:11| But, you know, get what you paid for there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10271)|
| 2:51:14| But I do think as we send it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10274)|
| 2:51:17| if any Planning Commissioners care about one perspective, that's mine for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10277)|
| 2:51:21| I want to make sure that we're not sending it back blindly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10281)|
| 2:51:25| with just please deal with this to Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10285)|
| 2:51:29| So I'm okay with remanding it as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10289)|
| 2:51:31| but I want to make sure this applicant receives response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10291)|
| 2:51:35| because this issue has been lingering for too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10295)|
| 2:51:41| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10301)|
| 2:51:44| Yes, I agree with the remanding it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10304)|
| 2:51:47| and it has been some shifting sands here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10307)|
| 2:51:50| I watched the Planning Commission meeting and saw the series of amendments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10310)|
| 2:51:56| and then another one was suggested here, and we really need to vet this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10316)|
| 2:52:01| This is not, I don't think, the proper time to pass this at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10321)|
| 2:52:06| And I only will add also that I appreciate one of the speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10326)|
| 2:52:11| who was talking about removing the section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10331)|
| 2:52:17| Well, let me put it the other way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10337)|
| 2:52:20| is that the owner occupancy requirement should be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10340)|
| 2:52:26| And that's been vetted a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10346)|
| 2:52:29| That went through the whole process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10349)|
| 2:52:31| We had a lot of input on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10351)|
| 2:52:33| and I would pass a really scrutinizing eye that comes back up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10353)|
| 2:52:41| eliminating the owner occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10361)|
| 2:52:44| It sounds like territory that we had visited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10364)|
| 2:52:48| We went through a whole process with the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10368)|
| 2:52:51| That's what our previous people and some of us actually decided at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10371)|
| 2:52:58| and I don't think we're ready to change that at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10378)|
| 2:53:01| So that's just a note, I suppose, for Planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10381)|
| 2:53:04| and the Planning Commission about at least what they can expect from me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10384)|
| 2:53:08| if it comes up eliminating that owner occupancy requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10388)|
| 2:53:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10395)|
| 2:53:16| Council Member Singh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10396)|
| 2:53:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10397)|
| 2:53:18| I'm good with remanding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10398)|
| 2:53:20| That makes sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10400)|
| 2:53:22| But I would like to hear from Mr. Marlowe on if there is anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10402)|
| 2:53:28| You were making a lot of different changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10408)|
| 2:53:30| Is there something you'd like to suggest for us to send it back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10410)|
| 2:53:34| Well, so over the weekend, I think maybe Thursday, Cheryl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10414)|
| 2:53:38| I met with you and got a peek at the mayor's proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10418)|
| 2:53:42| and I think that there were some good parts there that could be adapted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10422)|
| 2:53:45| I was surprised the mayor's proposal didn't have ADUs at all mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10425)|
| 2:53:50| And so in addressing some of Roberto's concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10430)|
| 2:53:56| and today Tommy's concerns, I revamped this today twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10436)|
| 2:54:02| The most recent version I distributed to all of you just before council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10442)|
| 2:54:06| and it leaves the owner occupied in place everywhere outside of TDR,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10446)|
| 2:54:11| which is basically inside the older neighborhoods in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10451)|
| 2:54:15| It returns the size to 40% limit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10455)|
| 2:54:18| except in areas where the primary structure is smaller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10458)|
| 2:54:22| and it sets a floor that it could be 500 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10462)|
| 2:54:26| But in those smaller ones, it limits it to one bedroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10466)|
| 2:54:30| so we don't get crazy little rooms and trying to maximize everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10470)|
| 2:54:34| And it puts one parking space back in from my original proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10474)|
| 2:54:40| but eliminates it inside the TDR area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10480)|
| 2:54:43| And then on the maximum height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10483)|
| 2:54:46| I came to the same compromise that I offered to Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10486)|
| 2:54:50| that fell on deaf ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10490)|
| 2:54:52| We don't really need 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10492)|
| 2:54:53| 24 is what several architects have told me makes the garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10493)|
| 2:54:57| or the apartment above it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10497)|
| 2:54:59| 18 is just too small unless you start hanging dormers off both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10499)|
| 2:55:04| 24 would work, and it keeps it as small as practical for a design standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10504)|
| 2:55:11| So I would ask you if you could amend this to send this best version| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10511)|
| 2:55:16| that's come out of a lot of input and feedback to Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10516)|
| 2:55:20| so that we sort of go with our best foot forward, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10520)|
| 2:55:24| I hear what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10524)|
| 2:55:25| but I feel like that's something that at planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10525)|
| 2:55:28| there can be more time spent on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10528)|
| 2:55:31| I like all of your amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10531)|
| 2:55:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10533)|
| 2:55:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10534)|
| 2:55:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10535)|
| 2:55:36| Council Member Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10536)|
| 2:55:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10539)|
| 2:55:41| Several have made comments about the owner occupancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10541)|
| 2:55:44| and we've asked Mr. Ahrens about the enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10544)|
| 2:55:46| I just want to make a few comments about that for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10546)|
| 2:55:51| Owner occupancy with an ADU is about getting a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10551)|
| 2:55:56| to actually build a structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10556)|
| 2:55:58| It's not about who occupies it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10558)|
| 2:56:00| I could build an ADU, and that is what Mr. Ahrens was alluding to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10560)|
| 2:56:04| I could build an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10564)|
| 2:56:06| I have to prove that I own the property and live there, Mr. Ahrens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10566)|
| 2:56:11| I have to prove that I own the property and live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10571)|
| 2:56:14| My address on my driver's license matches to pull a permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10574)|
| 2:56:17| with your department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10577)|
| 2:56:18| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10578)|
| 2:56:19| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10579)|
| 2:56:20| But then once I've built it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10580)|
| 2:56:21| there is no check to see that I still live there, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10581)|
| 2:56:25| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10585)|
| 2:56:27| So let me give you a scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10587)|
| 2:56:28| I own 229 East Scott, but I also own 223 East Scott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10588)|
| 2:56:32| I could change my address to 223 East Scott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10592)|
| 2:56:35| go down and get a new driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10595)|
| 2:56:37| I could come into your office or go online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10597)|
| 2:56:40| I could fill out an application to build an ADU in the backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10600)|
| 2:56:44| of 223 East Scott, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10604)|
| 2:56:47| Because that's my address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10607)|
| 2:56:49| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10609)|
| 2:56:50| Maybe I don't like living with my husband anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10610)|
| 2:56:52| I can live next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10612)|
| 2:56:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10613)|
| 2:56:54| So I build an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10614)|
| 2:56:55| I do like him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10615)|
| 2:56:57| But I build an ADU, and then I decide to change my address to 1514,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10617)|
| 2:57:02| another property I own on the other side of Broadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10622)|
| 2:57:05| and I can pull an ADU permit over there, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10625)|
| 2:57:09| Because your only authority is to check and see that's where I live| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10629)|
| 2:57:12| and I have matching documents, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10632)|
| 2:57:14| Once I've built them, you're not verifying who lives there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10634)|
| 2:57:17| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10637)|
| 2:57:19| But I will say that our staff that monitor this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10639)|
| 2:57:22| I'm confident that by the third time they would pick up on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10642)|
| 2:57:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10646)|
| 2:57:27| So those are all in the fourth district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10647)|
| 2:57:29| I just want to point that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10649)|
| 2:57:30| I wouldn't move my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10650)|
| 2:57:31| I think what's maybe more realistic is you create an ADU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10651)|
| 2:57:36| and you realize your property is very marketable and you just sell it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10656)|
| 2:57:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10659)|
| 2:57:40| And the next person, we don't track the sale of homes in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10660)|
| 2:57:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10664)|
| 2:57:45| I think that's probably more reasonable to expect rather than somebody going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10665)|
| 2:57:50| down and changing their driver's license every third week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10670)|
| 2:57:53| I can't build them that fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| I don't have that kind of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10675)|
| 2:57:57| But I think that's a real issue is you build a marketable property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10677)|
| 2:58:03| and it's sold and we don't track the sale of homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10683)|
| 2:58:06| I think that's the part that becomes problematic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10686)|
| 2:58:08| And so it exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10688)|
| 2:58:10| Or I could go buy a property with an ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10690)|
| 2:58:12| but you're not tracking and monitoring whether I live there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10692)|
| 2:58:15| and whether I rent it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10695)|
| 2:58:17| What I'm hearing from constituents, even the constituents that emailed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10697)|
| 2:58:20| asking, you know, having opinions on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10700)|
| 2:58:24| the concern was short-term rentals in ADUs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10704)|
| 2:58:28| It wasn't whether I built an ADU at the property next door to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10708)|
| 2:58:32| or all the different properties that I own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10712)|
| 2:58:35| And part of the reason I want to point this out, Mr. Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10715)|
| 2:58:38| I realize you're not in the business of enforcing short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10718)|
| 2:58:41| Number one, I am not a giant fan of short-term rentals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10721)|
| 2:58:44| and we've talked about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10724)|
| 2:58:45| is because that's taken up housing for people that come here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10725)|
| 2:58:50| and tell us they need housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10730)|
| 2:58:52| Short-term rentals is turning our residential areas into hotels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10732)|
| 2:58:56| and commercial areas, which is not what we want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10736)|
| 2:58:59| We've also heard that that's very difficult for us to regulate as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10739)|
| 2:59:04| I think it's more difficult to regulate the pulling a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10744)|
| 2:59:08| or I could go buy any house on the market that happens to have an ADU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10748)|
| 2:59:11| and you can't regulate me making an owner occupied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10751)|
| 2:59:16| On a different side of the coin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10756)|
| 2:59:18| I could own a 700-square-foot, small, working-class house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10758)|
| 2:59:24| that needs a lot of repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10764)|
| 2:59:26| And you could say, well, you can't pull an ADU permit there and build an ADU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10766)|
| 2:59:30| You just have to have a 700-square-foot house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10770)|
| 2:59:33| Well, I'm at the tipping scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10773)|
| 2:59:35| I could tear it down and build something bigger, a three-bedroom, two-bath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10775)|
| 2:59:40| I could tear it down and build a duplex within our code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10780)|
| 2:59:43| but I can't keep that 700-square-foot affordable house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10783)|
| 2:59:48| and rent it out and then build an ADU in the backyard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10788)|
| 2:59:51| because we've decided that I can't go down and pull a permit to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10791)|
| 2:59:54| because I don't live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10794)|
| 2:59:56| And that doesn't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10796)|
| 2:59:58| I could tear it down and get rid of affordable housing and build a duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10798)|
| 3:00:02| but I can't keep the affordable housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10802)|
| 3:00:04| and build an ADU in the giant backyard of a 50-foot by 150-foot duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10804)|
| 3:00:10| or a lot, and I find that odd to wrap my head around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10810)|
| 3:00:14| because the real issue, what I'm hearing from the constituents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10814)|
| 3:00:17| who all emailed me is they don't want to see ADUs used as short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10817)|
| 3:00:22| So, to me, that's the issue, and I'm going to go on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10822)|
| 3:00:27| and, Vice Mayor, you know this, I seconded your motion in 2018,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10827)|
| 3:00:33| but having much more time and looking at different scenarios,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10833)|
| 3:00:36| the owner-occupancy thing is very troubling to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10836)|
| 3:00:39| because it's about short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10839)|
| 3:00:41| It's not about me building an additional unit of housing for my parent or,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10841)|
| 3:00:48| heck, maybe I don't want my mom to live in the backyard of my yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10848)|
| 3:00:51| Maybe I want her to be in the backyard of one of my other properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10851)|
| 3:00:54| because, apparently, I'm one of those terrible people that provides housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10854)|
| 3:00:58| By the way, that was one of the comments earlier tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10858)|
| 3:01:00| is that people that provide rentals are bad people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10860)|
| 3:01:03| I do take issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10863)|
| 3:01:05| Council Member Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10865)|
| 3:01:07| Well, as a non-bad person, I'll just close this off here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10867)|
| 3:01:13| So, in lieu of us recoding tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10873)|
| 3:01:18| and hearing the applicant's desire to take his best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10878)|
| 3:01:23| and brightest to planning staff to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10883)|
| 3:01:28| I don't know what words I need to use, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10888)|
| 3:01:31| but I would make a motion that we do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10891)|
| 3:01:35| so that his application can be reviewed as he now intends to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10895)|
| 3:01:43| We're not going to give him direct feedback now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10903)|
| 3:01:45| Some of us have already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10905)|
| 3:01:47| I think, if possible, the applicant deserves the right to submit this back to planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10907)|
| 3:01:55| Council Member Smith, I think that remanding it, and with Amy Brooks here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10915)|
| 3:01:59| she will be able to take into account those substantive changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10919)|
| 3:02:03| I mean, Ms. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10923)|
| 3:02:05| I think formally to do so would be important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10925)|
| 3:02:07| Well, we're not the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10927)|
| 3:02:09| Mr. Swanson, can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10929)|
| 3:02:11| Well, I think the motion to remand will accomplish what you want to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10931)|
| 3:02:16| Certainly, Mr. Marlow is free to accompany it back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10936)|
| 3:02:19| and to offer any suggestions, any changes, any amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10939)|
| 3:02:22| that he thinks now, upon further reflection, are appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10942)|
| 3:02:26| And I assume that the planning folks will make sure that those are considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10946)|
| 3:02:31| and then they will come up with their best recommendation to make to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10951)|
| 3:02:36| and then the commission will do whatever it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10956)|
| 3:02:38| So are we not allowed to do what I just suggested?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10958)|
| 3:02:43| I can read verbatim it into the record and have it done, correct, if I need to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10963)|
| 3:02:49| I don't think we need to do that, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10969)|
| 3:02:50| But you're amending something and you're not passing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10970)|
| 3:02:53| So I think that makes it very complicated because what you're asking the planning commission to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10973)|
| 3:03:01| is to reconsider this and take a look at it a second time around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10981)|
| 3:03:06| So we can't amend and remand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10986)|
| 3:03:08| You're going to get it back here again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10988)|
| 3:03:11| But, Mr. Swanson, that wasn't my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10991)|
| 3:03:13| Can we amend and remand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10993)|
| 3:03:16| Can you amend and remand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10996)|
| 3:03:18| Back to planning, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=10998)|
| 3:03:24| You can try it, but it doesn't make any sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11004)|
| 3:03:27| No, I don't think it's the proper method to send it back to NPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11007)|
| 3:03:34| because NPC has its statutory obligations that we don't tell them what to do at the outset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11014)|
| 3:03:42| We tell them what to do later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11022)|
| 3:03:44| So you can ask them to consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11024)|
| 3:03:49| If you want to remand it and ask them to consider X and Y or X and Y and Z,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11029)|
| 3:03:58| that is proper motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11038)|
| 3:04:00| But you don't amend it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11040)|
| 3:04:03| You just remand it and ask them to consider changing it and looking at X, Y, and Z.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11043)|
| 3:04:10| Okay, well, then I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11050)|
| 3:04:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11052)|
| 3:04:13| Whatever you just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11053)|
| 3:04:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11054)|
| 3:04:15| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11055)|
| 3:04:18| Okay, so we have Andrew's motion on the floor to remand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11058)|
| 3:04:24| so I assume now I'm going to play lawyer because I slept at Holiday Inn Express.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11064)|
| 3:04:30| I think you have to make a friendly amendment to include the latest version being the version that is remanded back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11070)|
| 3:04:42| He would have to agree with it, and then there we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11082)|
| 3:04:45| Seeing as that I'm not a landlord, I'll make that friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11085)|
| 3:04:50| I'm not either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11090)|
| 3:04:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11091)|
| 3:04:52| No offense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11092)|
| 3:04:53| It's late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11093)|
| 3:04:54| I don't accept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11094)|
| 3:04:55| As much as I respect and appreciate what my colleague is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11095)|
| 3:04:59| I don't accept that as a friendly amendment because we are doing what we just said we don't want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11099)|
| 3:05:05| which is making something that is very complex on the fly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11105)|
| 3:05:17| and then not providing notice regarding it and not giving public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11117)|
| 3:05:23| But what I would recommend my colleague does is what I heard from our law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11123)|
| 3:05:29| which is in the bounds of the remand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11129)|
| 3:05:33| if you would like the Planning Commission to consider something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11133)|
| 3:05:37| to just read that into the record now and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11137)|
| 3:05:42| I would appreciate it if when staff reviews this you would consider the following things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11142)|
| 3:05:47| and I think that accomplishes what you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11147)|
| 3:05:50| That would be my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11150)|
| 3:05:51| With respect, there's no public notice for that type of informal addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11151)|
| 3:05:57| So for Planning Commission staff, please watch this and do what I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11157)|
| 3:06:03| We'll move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11163)|
| 3:06:04| I just have a hard time sending something back formally that's publicly noticed that the applicant does not want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11164)|
| 3:06:10| before that body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11170)|
| 3:06:12| It makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11172)|
| 3:06:13| We're sending something back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11173)|
| 3:06:16| Director Brooks, talented team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11176)|
| 3:06:18| but we're formally sending something back that the applicant's not asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11178)|
| 3:06:22| and has waited long enough to have this provided back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11182)|
| 3:06:26| He's collected input from us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11186)|
| 3:06:27| and for us to intentionally send something back that he's not asking for creates a headache for somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11187)|
| 3:06:36| Director Brooks, when it seems like this is going to be remanded back to your staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11196)|
| 3:06:41| and then back to Planning Commission as part of your review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11201)|
| 3:06:45| will you go on the record and say you will consider Mr. Marlowe's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11205)|
| 3:06:52| some of the changes and elements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11212)|
| 3:06:54| I mean, it's all just changes around these same elements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11214)|
| 3:06:57| and your staff would consider those as you review this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11217)|
| 3:07:00| Like what's the best path forward that will eventually come back to council based on your recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11220)|
| 3:07:07| Yes, we will consider Mr. Marlowe's changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11227)|
| 3:07:12| if he so wishes to submit those to us as part of the review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11232)|
| 3:07:18| Is that sufficient?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11238)|
| 3:07:21| Yeah, and also I think council has said, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11241)|
| 3:07:24| I want you to also work with our staff to, you know, understand these elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11244)|
| 3:07:30| I mean, Mr. Marlowe is very smart, but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11250)|
| 3:07:33| he is just one person and one person's experience and perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11253)|
| 3:07:37| and so having the perspective of our plans, reviews, and inspection teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11257)|
| 3:07:42| and your team and others will create a better process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11262)|
| 3:07:48| And it is complicated, which is one reason why we didn't do it right in the middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11268)|
| 3:07:53| the missing middle thing, because it's a little complicated aspect to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11273)|
| 3:07:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11279)|
| 3:08:00| I have a list of items that you all discussed this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11280)|
| 3:08:02| and we often do go back and watch these again before we present any recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11282)|
| 3:08:07| when things are remanded back to the planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11287)|
| 3:08:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11290)|
| 3:08:12| So the motion on the floor is to remand this back to planning staff and commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11292)|
| 3:08:18| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11298)|
| 3:08:20| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11300)|
| 3:08:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11302)|
| 3:08:23| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11303)|
| 3:08:24| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11304)|
| 3:08:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11305)|
| 3:08:28| 12C is an ordinance to close an unnamed street from Houstonia Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11308)|
| 3:08:33| to its western terminus located along the northern border of parcel 058JA00101| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11313)|
| 3:08:41| and the southern border of parcel 058GF033| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11321)|
| 3:08:44| and authorizing the mayor to execute quitclaim deeds to the adjacent property owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11324)|
| 3:08:48| Mark Edward Bass, applicant, 4th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11328)|
| 3:08:51| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11331)|
| 3:08:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11332)|
| 3:08:53| Motion made to approve and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11333)|
| 3:08:54| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11334)|
| 3:08:56| Seeing none, all those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11336)|
| 3:08:58| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11338)|
| 3:08:59| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11339)|
| 3:09:00| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11340)|
| 3:09:02| 12D is an ordinance to change the base zoning classification of property located at 0| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11342)|
| 3:09:06| and 237 Chickamauga Avenue from RN2 District to RN3 District,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11346)|
| 3:09:11| leaving all special purpose and overlay districts unchanged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11351)|
| 3:09:13| Damon Faulconier, applicant, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11353)|
| 3:09:17| Mayor, I think we have some speakers signed up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11357)|
| 3:09:20| I'd like to hear from them first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11360)|
| 3:09:21| Yeah, I think three people signed up to speak in opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11361)|
| 3:09:27| The first one is Matt Morlock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11367)|
| 3:09:39| Mr. Morlock, please state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11379)|
| 3:09:42| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11382)|
| 3:09:43| Matt Morlock, Chickamauga Avenue, 261 Chickamauga Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11383)|
| 3:09:49| which, as you might notice, is right next to the parcel in question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11389)|
| 3:09:54| And I'm here to request that you deny this rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11394)|
| 3:10:01| I wrote a long thing, but after this meeting tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11401)|
| 3:10:05| I want to talk about that bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11405)|
| 3:10:09| Just kidding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11409)|
| 3:10:13| But anybody that knows the street, that knows the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11413)|
| 3:10:18| knows that there aren't any crazy high-density developments in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11418)|
| 3:10:23| because it's a very well-developed neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11423)|
| 3:10:27| Councilman Thomas has really helped usher along some really responsible zoning there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11427)|
| 3:10:32| And the developer in question, who is not here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11432)|
| 3:10:38| is trying to pack seven units onto a tiny parcel, and it's just too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11438)|
| 3:10:46| I think that the Neighborhood Association has vehemently opposed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11446)|
| 3:10:50| You're going to hear from a couple of other neighbors that have shown up for every Planning Commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11450)|
| 3:10:54| and the meeting here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11454)|
| 3:10:56| Nobody has shown up in favor of this other than the developer and his agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11456)|
| 3:11:03| And while we don't oppose higher-density development, seven units is just too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11463)|
| 3:11:08| We would definitely approve anything like a duplex or a triplex on that lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11468)|
| 3:11:13| And that's really boring compared to all the other stuff you talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11473)|
| 3:11:16| but I don't think it's a good idea to allow this to get bumped up for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11476)|
| 3:11:22| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11482)|
| 3:11:24| But with that $20 million, I bet you could put like a bar and a sandwich shop in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11484)|
| 3:11:30| for those of us who skip dinner for these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11490)|
| 3:11:33| It would make it a lot more interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11493)|
| 3:11:36| But thanks for considering this, and thank you so much for spending all your time with all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11496)|
| 3:11:42| I haven't been to any of these meetings, and holy crap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11502)|
| 3:11:47| Thanks, all y'all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11507)|
| 3:11:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11510)|
| 3:11:52| The next person signing up to speak in opposition is Wes Breitenbach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11512)|
| 3:12:17| Wes Breitenbach, 726 Chickamauga Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11537)|
| 3:12:20| It's pretty exciting to watch all the checks and balances of our local government happening here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11540)|
| 3:12:26| I rode my bike here tonight from the Oakwood-Lincoln Park neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11546)|
| 3:12:31| and you get to see a lot of the diversity that happens in those couple of hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11551)|
| 3:12:35| the changes of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11555)|
| 3:12:36| They're very distinct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11556)|
| 3:12:38| You can see each neighborhood and the qualities and characters that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11558)|
| 3:12:44| I'd fight for each one of those neighborhoods the same way I'm fighting for my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11564)|
| 3:12:49| I love this neighborhood, Oakwood-Lincoln Park, and that's one of the things that really attracted me to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11569)|
| 3:12:54| Not only my home, but my business is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11574)|
| 3:12:57| We decided to try to keep it there because of the passion that people have for this neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11577)|
| 3:13:03| and the commitment that we have for this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11583)|
| 3:13:06| We fought really, really hard to get a historic overlay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11586)|
| 3:13:09| We didn't want to be historic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11589)|
| 3:13:10| We wanted to keep it a working-class neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11590)|
| 3:13:12| but we wanted to have the protection of not having what happened in the 80s and 90s| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11592)|
| 3:13:15| where these houses were popping up that clearly don't belong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11595)|
| 3:13:17| because you can drive around the neighborhood and see what was built and when it was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11597)|
| 3:13:22| There's a lot of questionable houses that are there, and we wanted to stop that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11602)|
| 3:13:27| This property has got so many issues with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11607)|
| 3:13:30| trying to develop it in the way that they're trying to look at in their proposals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11610)|
| 3:13:33| If they're putting this many houses, if you just look at the average household,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11613)|
| 3:13:36| they say that it has between 1.9 to 2.5, so we'll just agree on two children per household.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11616)|
| 3:13:42| That puts it at seven houses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11622)|
| 3:13:44| That's 14 kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11624)|
| 3:13:46| That's quickly up into the 20s and 30s of kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11626)|
| 3:13:48| It's in two blind hills that come up to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11628)|
| 3:13:52| There are no sidewalks within blocks of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11632)|
| 3:13:57| I could see, like Matt mentioned, maybe a duplex, maybe a triplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11637)|
| 3:14:01| but we need to think about the unintended consequences of what Mr. Smith had mentioned earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11641)|
| 3:14:07| of some of these developments that we do and things that we maybe not think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11647)|
| 3:14:11| We don't live in that neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11651)|
| 3:14:13| and we don't think about the fact that to have a driveway to accommodate that has got to be 20 feet wide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11653)|
| 3:14:18| because they're going to have to have trash service, and that's a big, wide driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11658)|
| 3:14:21| and a lot of asphalt to have water running off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11661)|
| 3:14:24| And that neighborhood historically has issues with flooding, if you're familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11664)|
| 3:14:29| So I definitely, absolutely, 100% believe that you should be not approving this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11669)|
| 3:14:38| that you should be against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11678)|
| 3:14:39| We're against this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11679)|
| 3:14:40| There's nobody in the neighborhood that's for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11680)|
| 3:14:41| There's nobody that lives around there that's for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11681)|
| 3:14:42| And one of the things that this is also going to do with the overlay protection that we had assumed we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11682)|
| 3:14:47| and hoped that it would have some teeth to it, if this pushes over and this does pass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11687)|
| 3:14:52| that's not going to stop anybody else from doing the same exact thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11692)|
| 3:14:55| because they're all going to be coming here wanting to get their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11695)|
| 3:14:58| This is from a developer that is not from our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11698)|
| 3:15:02| They're coming in to take advantage of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11702)|
| 3:15:04| They bought it at a very low price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11704)|
| 3:15:06| They want to get as much money as they possibly can for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11706)|
| 3:15:08| They're not building a house to sell it, to give someone else the advantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11708)|
| 3:15:11| They're going to be taking that money from our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11711)|
| 3:15:13| and it's going to be going to some investment firm somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11713)|
| 3:15:17| It's not staying in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11717)|
| 3:15:20| There's no good access to this plot to have this many houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11720)|
| 3:15:24| There's no bus station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11724)|
| 3:15:25| There's no bus stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11725)|
| 3:15:26| There's no sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11726)|
| 3:15:27| There's no way for people to get in and out other than this one driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11727)|
| 3:15:30| It's kind of a little island.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11730)|
| 3:15:32| There's no grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11732)|
| 3:15:33| There's no mini mart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11733)|
| 3:15:34| There's nothing close to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11734)|
| 3:15:35| If this was on the periphery, like on the Broadway side or the central side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11735)|
| 3:15:40| those would be areas that would be a little more appropriate for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11740)|
| 3:15:42| development like this, but not this lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11742)|
| 3:15:45| And so I'm really hoping tonight that we're going to see the council side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11745)|
| 3:15:50| with the neighborhood that has voted for you guys and put you a lot here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11750)|
| 3:15:54| put a lot of you people in these seats, that you're going to side with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11754)|
| 3:15:58| and that you're going to see us as a priority and not the dollar signs that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11758)|
| 3:16:02| this developer is seeing, because that's all they see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11762)|
| 3:16:05| They see the dollar signs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11765)|
| 3:16:06| They're going to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11766)|
| 3:16:07| They're going to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11767)|
| 3:16:09| So we would appreciate the hard work that this neighborhood has put into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11769)|
| 3:16:13| having this overlay and to have all these protections put in and to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11773)|
| 3:16:16| through the rezoning, the recode, and all of that other stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11776)|
| 3:16:20| that we just sit with this for a little while before we just start changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11780)|
| 3:16:24| things all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11784)|
| 3:16:25| Because I promise you, if this does get changed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11785)|
| 3:16:27| you will have many more people just like this doing the exact same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11787)|
| 3:16:31| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11791)|
| 3:16:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11794)|
| 3:16:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11795)|
| 3:16:36| The next person signed up to speak in opposition to this is Lee Hume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11796)|
| 3:16:44| Is Mr. Hume still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11804)|
| 3:16:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11816)|
| 3:16:57| Michelle Ivester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11817)|
| 3:17:05| That name is not familiar to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11825)|
| 3:17:09| So you're going to have to bear with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11829)|
| 3:17:10| because I wrote a really pretty speech,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11830)|
| 3:17:12| and I'm going to go ahead and read it all to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11832)|
| 3:17:14| because I worked hard on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11834)|
| 3:17:16| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11836)|
| 3:17:17| I'm Michelle Ivester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11837)|
| 3:17:18| I live on Chickamauga Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11838)|
| 3:17:21| I'm the president of the Oakwood-Lincoln Park Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11841)|
| 3:17:24| and I'm here to advocate for my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11844)|
| 3:17:26| Many of my neighbors wanted to be here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11846)|
| 3:17:28| but unfortunately weren't able to do so because of their work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11848)|
| 3:17:31| or family commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11851)|
| 3:17:32| And I had forgotten how freezing it gets in here after everybody closes out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11852)|
| 3:17:36| so I wish I would have brought my blanket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11856)|
| 3:17:38| Since my time on the OATNA board, I've been to a few hundred meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11858)|
| 3:17:43| probably close to 1,000 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11863)|
| 3:17:45| I've attended numerous recode meetings, went to almost all of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11865)|
| 3:17:50| as well as hosted meetings to help ensure that our residents are informed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11870)|
| 3:17:53| about possible changes that might be happening in our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11873)|
| 3:17:56| Many of you may be aware that ours is an older neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11876)|
| 3:18:00| and we have already overburdened infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11880)|
| 3:18:02| which is one of the many concerns that is regarding this rezoning request tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11882)|
| 3:18:08| Last month's concerned neighbors met briefly with their developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11888)|
| 3:18:10| who has since changed his request from rezoning from R and 4 to R and 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11890)|
| 3:18:16| However, this just seems to be an attempt to circumnavigate the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11896)|
| 3:18:19| because for what he has to do, he has to go do a special process to get the 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11899)|
| 3:18:25| so it would put it basically back to the R and 4 again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11905)|
| 3:18:28| So it's just a way to go around the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11908)|
| 3:18:33| And if you look on KGIS, you can see from both city and county zoning maps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11913)|
| 3:18:37| all of the current zoning within a one- to two-block radiance is low-density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11917)|
| 3:18:40| single-family residence, except for that one loan apartment building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11920)|
| 3:18:43| that was built in the 90s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11923)|
| 3:18:45| And allowing the change would be another case of spot zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11925)|
| 3:18:47| which is really inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11927)|
| 3:18:50| In preparation for this meeting, I looked over various missing middle plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11930)|
| 3:18:54| which seem to be a possible compromise in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11934)|
| 3:18:59| And if a plan like those suggested were passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11939)|
| 3:19:01| there would actually be no need for rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11941)|
| 3:19:04| He could build a duplex or a triplex or even possibly a quad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11944)|
| 3:19:10| It says even, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11950)|
| 3:19:12| the mayor's proposal even would allow a townhouse with three to four apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11952)|
| 3:19:17| Though larger than the existing surrounding homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11957)|
| 3:19:19| it would be a better fit for our established residential neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11959)|
| 3:19:22| than to cram seven townhouses onto this little small lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11962)|
| 3:19:26| that already has a house on it, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11966)|
| 3:19:29| ULTNA is very aware of the current housing situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11969)|
| 3:19:32| and it seems that a missing middle proposal would be an optimal compromise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11972)|
| 3:19:35| to some extent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11975)|
| 3:19:36| That being said, the missing middle and affordable housing are all catchphrases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11976)|
| 3:19:39| that I hear all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11979)|
| 3:19:42| They seem to be the go-to wording for developers these days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11982)|
| 3:19:44| but unless, and I can't stress this enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11984)|
| 3:19:48| unless the rents are such that the working class can afford them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11988)|
| 3:19:51| then it's all just words used to manipulate our housing crisis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11991)|
| 3:19:55| These proposed townhouses won't be aimed at the working class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11995)|
| 3:19:58| and we've been told the owner won't accept any type of voucher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=11998)|
| 3:20:00| or assistance for people that live there, which is worrisome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12000)|
| 3:20:03| If the residents are pushed out of their homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12003)|
| 3:20:05| because they can no longer afford them due to the increased property values,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12005)|
| 3:20:08| if that's built, which in turn increases the property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12008)|
| 3:20:13| then we're no better off and the cycle of gentrification continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12013)|
| 3:20:17| This property is a fairly recent acquisition from Mr. Nathan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12017)|
| 3:20:21| who resides in California.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12021)|
| 3:20:23| He purchased it in November of 21| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12023)|
| 3:20:25| and then transferred it to his corporation in August of 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12025)|
| 3:20:29| It would seem that there was no regard for the property zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12029)|
| 3:20:31| or any consideration of the neighborhood at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12031)|
| 3:20:34| before the property was obtained, and that's an oversight on his part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12034)|
| 3:20:37| but one that the neighborhood should not be penalized for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12037)|
| 3:20:42| Poor planning or lack thereof or self-created hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12042)|
| 3:20:44| should not be considered as a valid reasoning for rezoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12044)|
| 3:20:47| especially in an established older residential neighborhood such as ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12047)|
| 3:20:50| If this rezoning is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12050)|
| 3:20:52| the developer would be allowed to put in just about whatever they want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12052)|
| 3:20:55| and it actually says that on his plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12055)|
| 3:20:57| Oh, yeah, we might put that in front of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12057)|
| 3:20:59| but we can change it if we want to once we get our zoning through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12059)|
| 3:21:02| A lot of people don't understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12062)|
| 3:21:05| As I mentioned before, with appropriate missing middle housing plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12065)|
| 3:21:08| there may be no need to have the property rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12068)|
| 3:21:11| if the missing middle plans go through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12071)|
| 3:21:14| and I've heard a lot of great feedback on a lot of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12074)|
| 3:21:20| Again, I'm here representing Oakwood-Lincoln Park residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12080)|
| 3:21:23| Thank you for listening for our concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12083)|
| 3:21:25| and we'd appreciate you voting no for the rezoning tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12085)|
| 3:21:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12088)|
| 3:21:30| Council members, that concludes the people who signed up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12090)|
| 3:21:32| to speak to this agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12092)|
| 3:21:34| Council Member Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12094)|
| 3:21:35| Yes, I just want to make some brief remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12095)|
| 3:21:37| and then I'll open it up to my colleagues for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12097)|
| 3:21:40| First thing I want to say is that this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12100)|
| 3:21:43| is an area that really benefited from recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12103)|
| 3:21:46| It was like the Wild West pretty much as far as zoning goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12106)|
| 3:21:51| The RN-5, which is beside the parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12111)|
| 3:21:55| is an example of what we were getting before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12115)|
| 3:21:58| It's turned sideways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12118)|
| 3:22:01| It has a slab of parking lot in front of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12121)|
| 3:22:04| It doesn't fit in at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12124)|
| 3:22:06| We saw that stuff coming into our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12126)|
| 3:22:09| so the recode actually has stabilized the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12129)|
| 3:22:15| and in combination with infield housing guidelines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12135)|
| 3:22:19| what we're seeing is lots being bought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12139)|
| 3:22:23| and houses being built that are in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12143)|
| 3:22:27| with the existing code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12147)|
| 3:22:29| So density is growing in Oakwood-Lincoln Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12149)|
| 3:22:33| It's growing steadily, but it's growing in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12153)|
| 3:22:36| that is consistent with that community feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12156)|
| 3:22:41| and with the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12161)|
| 3:22:43| And I don't know if any of you had a chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12163)|
| 3:22:45| to go by this particular lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12165)|
| 3:22:48| I really hope you did because the topography is blind hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12168)|
| 3:22:56| There's a sign there that warns people of hidden driveways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12176)|
| 3:23:00| There's no sidewalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12180)|
| 3:23:03| CAT will eventually, we hope, put a bus service by there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12183)|
| 3:23:06| but at the moment, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12186)|
| 3:23:09| And I had a discussion with Ms. Brooks earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12189)|
| 3:23:13| and I think we agreed on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12193)|
| 3:23:16| that under the existing code right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12196)|
| 3:23:19| more than likely, with 29,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12199)|
| 3:23:24| two duplexes could be built there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12204)|
| 3:23:28| So you would have four units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12208)|
| 3:23:31| The zoning change would only go up to seven units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12211)|
| 3:23:35| but it wouldn't be, it would be outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12215)|
| 3:23:39| the constancy of developing the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12219)|
| 3:23:44| in conformity with RECODE, which is working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12224)|
| 3:23:48| So I know there's a huge concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12228)|
| 3:23:51| a valid concern for the housing problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12231)|
| 3:23:56| and affordable housing and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12236)|
| 3:23:58| and I've supported that in many ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12238)|
| 3:24:00| and in my district, I've supported it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12240)|
| 3:24:02| and it depended on significant increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12242)|
| 3:24:07| in solving that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12247)|
| 3:24:10| There's a ribbon-cutting in Inskip next week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12250)|
| 3:24:13| of 66 units of affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12253)|
| 3:24:16| I supported that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12256)|
| 3:24:18| That was at the proper place in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12258)|
| 3:24:22| Every place is site-specific, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12262)|
| 3:24:25| and this particular place is not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12265)|
| 3:24:29| knock a dent in the housing problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12269)|
| 3:24:33| and it's really going to significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12273)|
| 3:24:35| start undermining the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12275)|
| 3:24:38| of what has happened in this neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12278)|
| 3:24:41| Oakwood-Lincoln Park now is a healthier neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12281)|
| 3:24:44| than it's ever been, and density is increasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12284)|
| 3:24:48| But RECODE worked here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12288)|
| 3:24:50| That, in combination with the infield guidelines, has worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12290)|
| 3:24:54| So with that, I'll open it up to questions or discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12294)|
| 3:24:59| Just a point of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12299)|
| 3:25:00| the ribbon-cutting for Inskip Flats is this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12300)|
| 3:25:03| The ribbon-cutting for Inskip Flats is this Thursday, 1130,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12303)|
| 3:25:07| not next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12307)|

| 3:25:13| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12313)|
| 3:25:17| I don't think there's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12317)|
| 3:25:18| There's not a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12318)|
| 3:25:20| I will make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12320)|
| 3:25:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12322)|
| 3:25:23| Okay, motion made to deny has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12323)|

| 3:25:29| Really, my question was, is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12329)|
| 3:25:33| Now there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12333)|
| 3:25:35| Any questions or comments about the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12335)|

| 3:26:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12409)|
| 3:26:50| My name is Stan Johnson, 1617 Dandridge Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12410)|
| 3:26:53| Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12413)|
| 3:26:55| We have partnered with Two Rivers Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12415)|
| 3:26:58| and Trinity Foundation to really start looking at this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12418)|
| 3:27:01| to build a fiveplex in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12421)|
| 3:27:03| to actually serve our low-income community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12423)|
| 3:27:06| But our biggest thing is workforce development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12426)|
| 3:27:08| so we're working with young people between the age of 18| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12428)|
| 3:27:10| and 24 to help build these apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12430)|
| 3:27:13| They're really townhouses, one car garage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12433)|
| 3:27:17| 1,700 square feet, four-bedroom, things of that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12437)|
| 3:27:21| We want to make sure that we have some great things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12441)|
| 3:27:23| in our community for our young people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12443)|
| 3:27:25| and our people that's in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12445)|
| 3:27:27| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12447)|

| 3:27:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12457)|
| 3:27:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12458)|
| 3:27:40| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12460)|
| 3:27:44| There are three people signed up to speak at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12464)|
| 3:27:47| The first is Mr. Givens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12467)|
| 3:27:50| Is Mr. Givens present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12470)|
| 3:27:54| Okay, next is Rick Roach, Mr. Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12474)|
| 3:28:14| Rick Roach, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12494)|
| 3:28:20| First thing is still disturbed by the departure of Brooklyn Belk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12500)|
| 3:28:30| from the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12510)|
| 3:28:34| The back and forth of who, what, when, where, how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12514)|
| 3:28:40| was, frankly, disturbing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12520)|
| 3:28:46| Of course, my only reference was the Knox News story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12526)|
| 3:28:49| a story that was done by Ms. Dennis, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12529)|
| 3:28:57| contributed to with other people worked on it probably too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12537)|
| 3:29:04| But the whole thing was disturbing, Chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12544)|
| 3:29:08| just because you felt the need to have to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12548)|
| 3:29:13| and rebut the story, to explain the story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12553)|
| 3:29:23| to give your side of what happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12563)|
| 3:29:32| And that maybe speaks to the culture of the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12572)|
| 3:29:38| that you've spoken to, that you said that that was probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12578)|
| 3:29:45| one of the primary reasons bringing you in here was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12585)|
| 3:29:49| to change the culture of the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12589)|
| 3:29:53| And I think for those that pay a little bit of attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12593)|
| 3:30:07| to what goes on, I'm kind of turned into, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12607)|
| 3:30:15| a semi-street dog, because people come up to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12615)|
| 3:30:20| and they tell you stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12620)|
| 3:30:22| And they ask you, you know, did you see that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12622)|
| 3:30:26| Are you noticing how things are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12626)|
| 3:30:29| And what I've noticed is, especially since the new police station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12629)|
| 3:30:37| has gotten situated, I guess the new safety center, if you will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12637)|
| 3:30:42| gotten situated, East Knoxville especially is, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12642)|
| 3:30:56| it feels like it's under siege sometimes, just the presence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12656)|
| 3:31:00| the police presence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12660)|
| 3:31:04| And I know there's a lot of stuff that goes on, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12664)|
| 3:31:09| that I know goes on because I'm familiar with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12669)|
| 3:31:15| That's, I'm not going to try to push my perception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12675)|
| 3:31:21| of what that's all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12681)|
| 3:31:24| But again, the way I look at the police department is that you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12684)|
| 3:31:33| at the end of the day, where you're law enforcement, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12693)|
| 3:31:37| but you're also policy enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12697)|
| 3:31:41| And you don't have much to do with policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12701)|
| 3:31:47| Maybe you do, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12707)|
| 3:31:50| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12710)|
| 3:31:52| But at the end of the day, if your perception of how crime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12712)|
| 3:32:01| or potential crime is going down isn't jibing with the reality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12721)|
| 3:32:10| of how things are going down and then we have to deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12730)|
| 3:32:14| with the culture aspect of it, then you're going to have more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12734)|
| 3:32:21| you're going to have less cooperation within the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12741)|
| 3:32:24| in terms of getting things squared away and done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12744)|
| 3:32:27| I mean, making it safer, making it a safer community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12747)|
| 3:32:31| And that's where I'm hearing people comment, I mean, like say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12751)|
| 3:32:39| the city hasn't truly recognized the influx of policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12759)|
| 3:32:46| that cause homelessness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12766)|
| 3:32:49| And the homeless population in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12769)|
| 3:32:53| they may be a little bit more spread out, but it's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12773)|
| 3:32:58| And they kind of blend in with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12778)|
| 3:33:02| It's hard to tell them apart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12782)|
| 3:33:05| And we're seeing the effect of this every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12785)|
| 3:33:08| And we've had, I've seen multiple pictures, visions of people who now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12788)|
| 3:33:17| I saw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12797)|
| 3:33:19| Mr. Roach, that's five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12799)|
| 3:33:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12802)|
| 3:33:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12803)|
| 3:33:24| Last person to speak at public forum is Nikki Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12804)|
| 3:33:27| Ms. Lynn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12807)|
| 3:33:32| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12812)|
| 3:33:34| So I kind of want to apologize for last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12814)|
| 3:33:38| I am angry, and I believe I'm rightly so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12818)|
| 3:33:45| But let me give you an update on my neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12825)|
| 3:33:48| So we came here at the beginning of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12828)|
| 3:33:52| This entire section was filled with renters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12832)|
| 3:33:56| and it spurred because Rand Properties purchased my apartment complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12836)|
| 3:34:06| at Tillery Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12846)|
| 3:34:10| Now we're seeing elderly and veterans being served with eviction notices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12850)|
| 3:34:19| I can say that again, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12859)|
| 3:34:21| We're seeing veterans and elderly with disabilities facing evictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12861)|
| 3:34:30| This isn't we're projecting it's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12870)|
| 3:34:33| It's happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12873)|
| 3:34:36| Let that sink in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12876)|
| 3:34:39| So there's some things that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12879)|
| 3:34:43| Not that I want to talk about bridges again, but it's something here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12883)|
| 3:34:49| We're talking about improving communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12889)|
| 3:34:54| and we're talking about homelessness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12894)|
| 3:34:57| and we're talking about moving through spaces safely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12897)|
| 3:35:02| and supporting those in need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12902)|
| 3:35:05| Pedestrian bridge isn't going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12905)|
| 3:35:08| But putting in sidewalks on Blind Hills will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12908)|
| 3:35:14| That's going to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12914)|
| 3:35:18| Providing that $20 million to homeless services organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12918)|
| 3:35:27| Just a thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12927)|
| 3:35:29| I know that the last two meetings that you all have approved money to give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12929)|
| 3:35:34| to VMC, which is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12934)|
| 3:35:37| I know the work that they're doing is fantastic because I also work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12937)|
| 3:35:40| in homeless services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12940)|
| 3:35:44| Shower trailer is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12944)|
| 3:35:47| Shower trailer is really important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12947)|
| 3:35:49| It speaks to dignity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12949)|
| 3:35:51| Being able to stay clean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12951)|
| 3:35:53| People not walking away from you because you smell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12953)|
| 3:35:56| It's a thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12956)|
| 3:35:58| But here's the other problem we're facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12958)|
| 3:36:03| If we can't issue rent control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12963)|
| 3:36:06| and as we've demonstrated from the last public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12966)|
| 3:36:11| and we can't call 211 because they have no resources to give,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12971)|
| 3:36:15| because the nonprofit organizations don't have the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12975)|
| 3:36:22| what can we do with $20 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12982)|
| 3:36:26| I'm just saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12986)|
| 3:36:29| Now I have two neighbors that are facing eviction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12989)|
| 3:36:34| I don't know if you're aware of where they can move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12994)|
| 3:36:39| and what resources they have to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=12999)|
| 3:36:42| But right now I can tell you they don't have anything available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13002)|
| 3:36:49| VMC, the money that was going to help with emergency shelter from last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13009)|
| 3:36:55| session was spent before they walked in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13015)|
| 3:37:00| because they want to ensure emergency shelter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13020)|
| 3:37:03| This is essentially reimbursement back to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13023)|
| 3:37:06| They're going to keep running the mobile shower trailer because it has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13026)|
| 3:37:12| happen because we're not addressing the issue here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13032)|
| 3:37:15| and it's housing, affordable housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13035)|
| 3:37:17| So I took a look at the development report from the Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13037)|
| 3:37:24| Knox County Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13044)|
| 3:37:27| and all the properties that I saw highlighted were not affordable at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13047)|
| 3:37:34| They were all over $1,400 for a single bedroom apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13054)|
| 3:37:41| My neighbors that are getting evicted can't afford that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13061)|
| 3:37:47| Where are they going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13067)|
| 3:37:50| So I urge you to drive down Broadway tonight on your way home because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13070)|
| 3:37:56| guarantee you all our homeless are not in CARM or Salvation Army.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13076)|
| 3:38:01| They're going to be sleeping on the streets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13081)|
| 3:38:04| and my neighbors are probably going to join them in the next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13084)|
| 3:38:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13089)|
| 3:38:10| I yield my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13090)|
| 3:38:13| Council, that concludes the People Sign Up for Public Forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13093)|
| 3:38:16| and without objection this meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13096)|
| 3:38:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-230905?start=13099)|
