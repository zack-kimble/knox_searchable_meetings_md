| 2:18:53| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8333)|
| 2:18:56| And just for the record, this has been delayed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8336)|
| 2:18:58| since July of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8338)|
| 2:19:00| It's an April application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8340)|
| 2:19:01| Yeah, April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8341)|
| 2:19:02| Yeah, April application, but it appeared before us in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8342)|
| 2:19:06| I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8346)|
| 2:19:08| Too long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8348)|
| 2:19:08| Or has it gone back that far now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8348)|
| 2:19:10| Well, that's to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8350)|
| 2:19:12| It was on MPC April, so it would have been May meeting then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8352)|
| 2:19:16| But we're going to find out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8356)|
| 2:19:18| There's got to be the end of it, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8358)|
| 2:19:20| I mean, there's got to be due process, as surely good faith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8360)|
| 2:19:24| and due process has surely been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8364)|
| 2:19:27| Six months, I mean, come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8367)|
| 2:19:29| I'd like to take a shot and let somebody sue us over it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8369)|
| 2:19:31| I guess, because I mean, this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8371)|
| 2:19:33| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8373)|
| 2:19:34| Maybe somebody just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8374)|
| 2:19:35| Well, the Rural Committee met last week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8375)|
| 2:19:37| and it will be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8377)|
| 2:19:38| Yeah, but it won't affect this application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8378)|
| 2:19:39| because it goes before it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8379)|
| 2:19:41| No, it's grandfathered in, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8381)|
| 2:19:43| No, it's only grandfathered for about two or three more months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8383)|
| 2:19:46| and then it will fall out following the new rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8386)|
| 2:19:49| Anything that is read today will go to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8389)|
| 2:19:56| After next month, it may go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8396)|
| 2:19:58| I don't know what the rule is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8398)|
| 2:20:00| I don't know the rule that has been presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8400)|
| 2:20:02| It limits the extensions, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8402)|
| 2:20:05| I mean, this one, I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8405)|
| 2:20:06| Go for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8406)|
| 2:20:07| It's your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8407)|
| 2:20:08| Well, it's got to, should die from a lack of emotion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8408)|
| 2:20:13| when there's no applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8413)|
| 2:20:16| I'd have to call on the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8416)|
| 2:20:17| They've done that in the past, years ago, I remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8417)|
| 2:20:22| The Court of Appeals has ruled that this body must| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8422)|
| 2:20:28| act on an application before it can be approved or denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8428)|
| 2:20:33| and that requires an affirmative vote of the majority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8433)|
| 2:20:35| of the membership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8435)|
| 2:20:37| And your rule currently says that when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8437)|
| 2:20:40| an applicant doesn't show, it's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8440)|
| 2:20:42| to be placed on the end of the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8442)|
| 2:20:44| and if they're not there upon the second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8444)|
| 2:20:47| at that meeting, then it gets bumped to the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8447)|
| 2:20:51| You have a rule that's being formed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8451)|
| 2:20:55| a revision that's being formed by the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8455)|
| 2:20:57| I think that'll be before you next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8457)|
| 2:21:02| I think that's the easiest solution to the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8462)|
| 2:21:06| that you are concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8466)|
| 2:21:08| I'll see if I can get a letter from the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8468)|
| 2:21:10| and see what he, if he doesn't, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8470)|
| 2:21:12| going to tell him it's going to be pulled off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8472)|
| 2:21:13| It's rusty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| Oh, OK, well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8475)|
| 2:21:17| I have a question, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8477)|
| 2:21:19| Commissioner Deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8479)|
| 2:21:20| So if this is correct, if it doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8480)|
| 2:21:23| have a majority opinion by this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8483)|
| 2:21:27| then it can die at that moment without a majority of opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8487)|
| 2:21:32| because the ruling then can be a majority of your commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8492)|
| 2:21:35| can say that this shouldn't proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8495)|
| 2:21:39| The Court of Appeals decision that I referenced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8499)|
| 2:21:42| indicates that the Court of Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8502)|
| 2:21:45| wants to see this body act on an application that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8505)|
| 2:21:49| comes before it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8509)|
| 2:21:52| Having something die for lack of a second or lack of a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8512)|
| 2:21:56| isn't an action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8516)|
| 2:21:58| In fact, that's exactly the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8518)|
| 2:22:02| that the Court of Appeals addressed in that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8522)|
| 2:22:06| You've got to vote on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8526)|
| 2:22:08| Your current rule says you can't vote unless they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8528)|
| 2:22:12| And the rule also says it gets pushed in the next agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8532)|
| 2:22:16| And so until that rule changes, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8536)|
| 2:22:18| don't think you should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8538)|
| 2:22:23| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8543)|
| 2:22:25| I'm going to try to make contact with the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8545)|
| 2:22:28| the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8548)|
| 2:22:29| And then I'm going to make a motion next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8549)|
| 2:22:31| if he doesn't show up, that we suspend the ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8551)|
| 2:22:34| And then take action on the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8554)|
| 2:22:35| And then we'll deal with that as it comes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8555)|
| 2:22:39| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8559)|
| 2:22:42| Daniel, is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8562)|
| 2:22:44| If we suspend the rule, that rule doesn't apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8564)|
| 2:22:47| I'm hesitant to advise you to suspend the rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8567)|
| 2:22:50| where the purpose of suspending the rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8570)|
| 2:22:52| is to deny someone a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8572)|
| 2:22:55| He denied it by not showing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8575)|
| 2:22:56| But I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8576)|
| 2:22:59| I'm not going to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8579)|
| 2:23:00| I'm not going to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8580)|
| 2:23:01| I'm not going to deny it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8581)|
| 2:23:02| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8582)|
| 2:23:05| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8585)|
| 2:23:07| Yes, to the law director, if we voted on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8587)|
| 2:23:14| and voted to deny it, would that end it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8594)|
| 2:23:19| It would be contrary to your rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8599)|
| 2:23:26| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8606)|
| 2:23:28| If we, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8608)|
| 2:23:30| If we start, like Commissioner Anders said this next time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8610)|
| 2:23:38| would that put us in harm's way of a litigation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8618)|
| 2:23:42| I believe the law director said it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8622)|
| 2:23:45| And so if we overdo our rules, then it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8625)|
| 2:23:51| puts us all in harm's way, too, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8631)|
| 2:23:55| State that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8635)|
| 2:23:56| OK, we've got a rule that says, OK, if they're not here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8636)|
| 2:24:00| we're going to pass it on to the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8640)|
| 2:24:02| And that rule's been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8642)|
| 2:24:03| And now we're getting ready to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8643)|
| 2:24:06| If we change it, we wait on the rule change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8646)|
| 2:24:09| then that gets us out of any kind of litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8649)|
| 2:24:11| Is that correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8651)|
| 2:24:16| You can never get yourself out of any kind of litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8656)|
| 2:24:20| But it lessens the effect, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8660)|
| 2:24:25| I think that is the advisable way to proceed with this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8665)|
| 2:24:29| You have a process for, you have a rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8669)|
| 2:24:33| You have a process for amending the rule, revising the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8673)|
| 2:24:38| And when an item comes before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8678)|
| 2:24:41| after the rule's been changed, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8681)|
| 2:24:45| doesn't put you in the place of suspending the rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8685)|
| 2:24:48| or violating the rule in order for the rule provides somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8688)|
| 2:24:52| for a right to a hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8692)|
| 2:24:54| But this is the case that we were addressing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8694)|
| 2:24:57| at the Rules Committee, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8697)|
| 2:25:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8700)|
| 2:25:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8700)|
| 2:25:01| Commissioner Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8701)|
| 2:25:03| Yes, Mr. Kelly, do your records show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8703)|
| 2:25:05| when that was presented the first time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8705)|
| 2:25:07| to the Knox County Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8707)|
| 2:25:11| May 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8711)|
| 2:25:12| OK, so he has not appeared for seven consecutive months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8712)|
| 2:25:16| I find it hard to believe that a judge would say that we did not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8716)|
| 2:25:20| give him ample opportunity to have his time before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8720)|
| 2:25:27| If you've missed seven consecutive times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8727)|
| 2:25:30| to appear to get a zoning approved or denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8730)|
| 2:25:36| I think that's way past a reasonable time period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8736)|
| 2:25:43| The rule simply doesn't address what a reasonable time period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8743)|
| 2:25:45| is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8745)|
| 2:25:48| It's Groundhog Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8748)|
| 2:25:50| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8750)|
| 2:25:51| Oh, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8751)|
| 2:25:52| Commissioner Schoonmaker, continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8752)|
| 2:25:56| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8756)|
| 2:25:58| I think we all are upset that this guy continues not to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8758)|
| 2:26:02| But the easiest and wisest thing for us to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8762)|
| 2:26:05| is just change our rules and then deal with it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8765)|
| 2:26:08| Mr. Kelly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8768)|
| 2:26:14| Anything else related to zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8774)|
| 2:26:21| Earlier this evening, I expressed a desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8781)|
| 2:26:24| that you contribute to the Flower Fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8784)|
| 2:26:27| Later on, I request that we not move something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8787)|
| 2:26:32| to the end of the agenda from the beginning of the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8792)|
| 2:26:34| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8794)|
| 2:26:37| It'll go to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8797)|
| 2:26:39| It'll go to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8799)|
| 2:26:42| We recognize that there's nobody in the audience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom161121?start=8802)|
