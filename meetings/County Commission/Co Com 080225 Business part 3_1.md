| 1:45:06| I'd have to defer to the Law Department, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| I'm not familiar with the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| It's so late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| We don't have anybody here from purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6309)|
| 1:45:10| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6310)|
| 1:45:11| But do we not have bond usually on contracts that we can go back on people if they fail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6311)|
| 1:45:14| to act on the contract properly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| I think it varies contract to contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| But I'm not a subject matter expert here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6320)|
| 1:45:21| I don't mean to be rude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| But let this man right here speak, right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| Mr. Draper just informed me that after a year, the first year of the performance of the contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6323)|
| 1:45:32| the way things are supposed to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6332)|
| 1:45:37| It's a feeding frenzy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6337)|
| 1:45:39| Listen, it's 1.15 in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| My client is being tried in this sort of Inquisition atmosphere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6343)|
| 1:45:47| This man is referencing test reports I've never even heard of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6347)|
| 1:45:51| He's certainly not taking them to TDAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6351)|
| 1:45:54| We're a heavily regulated facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| Five years ago, I'm speaking right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6357)|
| 1:46:01| five years ago, John Evans made a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6361)|
| 1:46:05| And the decision was that he wasn't going to require us to make a revenue share payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6365)|
| 1:46:11| And the logic for it was because there were a whole host of things the county never did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| The county induced my client to come into Knox County and to operate a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6376)|
| 1:46:24| under the pretext that there were so many thousands of yards of green waste that came to this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6384)|
| 1:46:31| And he came into this town and he set up shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6391)|
| 1:46:35| And the first thing he found out was there was not one stick of inventory on the site, a 10-acre site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6395)|
| 1:46:41| Not one stick of inventory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6401)|
| 1:46:43| It was all taken by the prior contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| That was number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6406)|
| 1:46:48| Then number two, we never got a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6408)|
| 1:46:50| It wasn't two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6410)|
| 1:46:51| We never got a permit over at Forks of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6411)|
| 1:46:55| Ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| And the list goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6417)|
| 1:46:59| I'm not debating this with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6419)|
| 1:47:02| I'm in a lawsuit with you, and I'm not debating with you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6422)|
| 1:47:05| I'm telling you, you need to know the facts about this operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6425)|
| 1:47:09| My client has not thieved anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| My client has been maligned repeatedly by these two gentlemen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6432)|
| 1:47:17| who profess to have investigators and all this data and information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6437)|
| 1:47:22| EPA came to the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6442)|
| 1:47:24| I met with EPA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6444)|
| 1:47:26| You know, these people call in test reports, but they never back it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6446)|
| 1:47:30| We couldn't find a test report at EPA, and yet we just get slammed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6450)|
| 1:47:35| What about the compost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6455)|
| 1:47:37| I'm telling you, I have met with TDEC repeatedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6457)|
| 1:47:42| They don't go and talk with TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6462)|
| 1:47:45| But, sir, the question is, I mean, these are two separate issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6465)|
| 1:47:52| and I'm trying to find out where the money is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6472)|
| 1:47:57| The money wasn't paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| Well, I think the contract, unless you have an amendment to that contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6479)|
| 1:48:08| I think you all still owe the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6488)|
| 1:48:10| Well, I think that the county owes us a lot more than what we might owe the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6490)|
| 1:48:15| but I'm telling you that five years ago we were told we didn't have to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6495)|
| 1:48:20| Now, whether John Evans should have come back before this body and gotten it approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| maybe he should have, but that was not our responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6505)|
| 1:48:29| And I don't think it showed up on the books of the county for five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6509)|
| 1:48:34| And, you know, I don't know why that wouldn't have come to someone's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6514)|
| 1:48:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6518)|
| 1:48:39| But I know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6519)|
| 1:48:41| My client, Natural Resources, wasn't running around refusing to pay anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6521)|
| 1:48:47| And we certainly never submitted a false claim, as he has alleged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6527)|
| 1:48:51| We are in litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| He wants to come in here in this forum and ambush us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6533)|
| 1:48:58| That's the pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6538)|
| 1:48:59| That's the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6539)|
| 1:49:00| And it's improper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6540)|
| 1:49:02| Well, the only agenda I'm after is trying to find out where the money was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6542)|
| 1:49:05| I asked Mr. Troyer last month to come forward with how much that should have been collected in Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6545)|
| 1:49:10| and now nobody still wants to say anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6550)|
| 1:49:14| I offered on Wednesday after the committee meetings to give you any information that you requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6554)|
| 1:49:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6558)|
| 1:49:19| How much does your client owe Knox County government based on what they figured they sold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6559)|
| 1:49:24| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| That's my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6566)|
| 1:49:27| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| Because we were told, in light of a whole range of things that never got done, that we didn't have to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6568)|
| 1:49:35| Now, can a calculation be made of what that number otherwise might be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6575)|
| 1:49:40| Sure it can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6580)|
| 1:49:41| I've not made it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6581)|
| 1:49:43| How much, if you would have paid it, if everything would have been to your satisfaction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6583)|
| 1:49:48| and your client would have had to pay based on what they've sold, what, in the last five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6588)|
| 1:49:54| what would that amount have been to the Knox County taxpayer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6594)|
| 1:49:57| I wrote a letter to Bruce Weitrick in October before Mr. Evans died, and I addressed this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6597)|
| 1:50:05| And I think, and hold me to it, I know you've got auditors and all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| Well, wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6610)|
| 1:50:11| But I'm trying to answer your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6611)|
| 1:50:13| The number at that time, as I recall, was about $120,000, I think, was what the number would calculate to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6613)|
| 1:50:21| Well, a minute ago somebody testified or spoke that nobody knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6621)|
| 1:50:25| Mr. Weitrick didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| I'm speaking from my personal knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6627)|
| 1:50:31| There was a number floated at about that time, and it was about that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6631)|
| 1:50:35| Well, if it's not on the agenda next month, I'm going to put it on the agenda that we terminate the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6635)|
| 1:50:40| I would suggest that the county commission needs to understand the full facts and circumstances of this contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6640)|
| 1:50:48| before anything gets terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6648)|
| 1:50:50| Because termination is capital punishment in the world of contract law, and there's a lot more to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6650)|
| 1:50:56| And we've offered to do a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6656)|
| 1:50:58| You've got eight commissioners here who don't know anything about our facility or this contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6658)|
| 1:51:03| and many of the rest of you haven't been out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6663)|
| 1:51:07| We have nothing to hide, not one thing to hide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6667)|
| 1:51:12| Not one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6672)|
| 1:51:13| It may not be you, but somewhere there's money missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6673)|
| 1:51:17| And it may not be you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6677)|
| 1:51:18| It may not be your client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6678)|
| 1:51:19| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6679)|
| 1:51:20| Well, we're the ones that are being sued by him under a theory of a false claim to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6680)|
| 1:51:25| Well, I don't know anything about that, but my obligation is to the citizens of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6685)|
| 1:51:29| if we had a signed contract for it to be honored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6689)|
| 1:51:33| Now, that's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6693)|
| 1:51:35| And I'm telling you that there's a history to this, and you're getting kind of an ambush story about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6695)|
| 1:51:41| and it's not the full story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6701)|
| 1:51:44| And Mr. Salter just told you what Mr. Evans conveyed to my client.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6704)|
| 1:51:50| And I don't know who else in county government knew or didn't know about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6710)|
| 1:51:54| but I'm just telling this body that my client wasn't refusing to pay anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6714)|
| 1:51:59| though he would pay today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6722)|
| 1:52:03| For the reasons that I'm explaining to you, there are all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6723)|
| 1:52:06| We're going over the same thing over and over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6726)|
| 1:52:08| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6728)|
| 1:52:10| Yes, thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6730)|
| 1:52:11| I was wanting to know if we could hear this on the 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6731)|
| 1:52:14| I didn't have my calendar out when you asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6734)|
| 1:52:17| Well, the 12th, we have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6737)|
| 1:52:20| Can we saddle back them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6740)|
| 1:52:23| It doesn't matter to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6743)|
| 1:52:24| We had discussed doing this on the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6744)|
| 1:52:27| I would have some people who would be coming from out of town to be available on the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6747)|
| 1:52:33| We have meetings on the 17th anyhow, right, Intergovernmental Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| We have Intergovernmental Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6756)|
| 1:52:37| We might as well do it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6757)|
| 1:52:39| I mean, we need to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6759)|
| 1:52:42| Do you want me to set it up for the 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| Set it up for the 17th, or you can start running the saw away every time it smells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6764)|
| 1:52:48| Who can be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6768)|
| 1:52:51| You'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6771)|
| 1:52:53| If you're not going to be there, you won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6773)|
| 1:52:56| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6776)|
| 1:52:58| I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6778)|
| 1:52:59| One up here for you, Mr. Draper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6779)|
| 1:53:03| You never made a statement about the two years on the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6783)|
| 1:53:06| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6786)|
| 1:53:07| That's not an accurate statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6787)|
| 1:53:09| There were several issues that relate to the permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6789)|
| 1:53:13| We have two separate sites, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| There is a Forks of the River site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| There's a Saw Way site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6798)|
| 1:53:20| And we never got a permit over at Forks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6800)|
| 1:53:25| We did get a permit, and it's issued July 28, 2003.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6805)|
| 1:53:29| It was supposed to have been obtained six months earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6809)|
| 1:53:32| Because it was delayed, we weren't able to even get up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6812)|
| 1:53:35| and start doing full-blown composting until about two years after we got to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6815)|
| 1:53:41| That's the statement that was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6821)|
| 1:53:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6823)|
| 1:53:44| John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6824)|
| 1:53:47| Who is supposed to be responsible for us collecting this money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6827)|
| 1:53:51| Which department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| Is this falling under the finance, or who?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6833)|
| 1:54:00| I think it would fall under, you know, it would be due to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| and I think the collection would be made through the solid waste department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| but it would be turned into the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6848)|
| 1:54:11| Who oversees these contracts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6851)|
| 1:54:14| The solid waste director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6854)|
| 1:54:15| The solid waste director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| But when people owe us money, you don't know anything about it in the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6857)|
| 1:54:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6862)|
| 1:54:23| We relied on the solid waste director to tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6863)|
| 1:54:28| That's proper procedure on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6868)|
| 1:54:34| Now, I can see you could rely on the solid waste department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6874)|
| 1:54:37| but I think we need to know what's in each contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6877)|
| 1:54:40| and what revenue would be due on those contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6880)|
| 1:54:46| And I would have thought it would have been covered in the financial audit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6886)|
| 1:54:51| which is done by an outside firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6891)|
| 1:54:53| But would that not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6893)|
| 1:54:55| Yeah, the solid waste is what a separate fund, isn't it, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6895)|
| 1:55:00| And I would think there would not be that many contracts within that fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6900)|
| 1:55:05| So I would think that would be part of your normal financial audit that would, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6905)|
| 1:55:11| audit what is to be received and verify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6911)|
| 1:55:16| Richard, would that not be handled by procurement or purchasing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6916)|
| 1:55:21| If they let the contract, would they not be the ones responsible for keeping up with it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6921)|
| 1:55:25| And every purchasing department I've ran.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| That falls under the finance department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6928)|
| 1:55:31| I believe I can answer all this question and solve us a lot of time here this late hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6931)|
| 1:55:36| What had happened, from what I can determine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6936)|
| 1:55:38| is that there was an expected revenue that was budgeted by the solid waste department each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6938)|
| 1:55:44| for the expected income from the facility, and that was budgeted at zero dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6944)|
| 1:55:49| So when that was budgeted at zero dollars, Knox County Finance didn't notice the money missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6949)|
| 1:55:54| That was what I was touching on earlier about the audit department maybe starting to take a few contracts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6954)|
| 1:55:59| and audit them every week, and that way every contract is touched on once every couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6959)|
| 1:56:04| Well, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6964)|
| 1:56:05| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6965)|
| 1:56:06| Hey, we're going to have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| I want to get to this in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6968)|
| 1:56:13| When they bill us, who authorizes the payment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6973)|
| 1:56:16| Knox County Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6976)|
| 1:56:18| It's also interesting to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6978)|
| 1:56:19| Well, I find it very unusual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| They bill us and we pay them, and they know that we're supposed to get a dollar and a half back, and we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6982)|
| 1:56:27| Well, also there's a section of the contract where the tipping fees would increase with CPI once a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6987)|
| 1:56:34| and that CPI increase was never asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6994)|
| 1:56:38| And it's my belief that they realize that if they asked for the CPI increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=6998)|
| 1:56:42| then it would have blown the gig, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7002)|
| 1:56:46| Also, Mr. Draper just made a statement that he never told us that they got their permit two years late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7006)|
| 1:56:52| As this commission is well aware, I love tape recorders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7012)|
| 1:56:55| I had a feeling he'd make that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7015)|
| 1:56:59| The payments that are referenced in the contract are tied to the happening of an expansion of the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7019)|
| 1:57:07| Not only has that not happened, we didn't even get our composting permit for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7027)|
| 1:57:14| They only have one composting permit, the Solway permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7034)|
| 1:57:17| So what other permit can he be talking about than the Solway permit being issued two years late,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7037)|
| 1:57:22| which was a total false statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7042)|
| 1:57:25| He also made the statement that the payments were tied to the happening of an expansion of the facility in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7045)|
| 1:57:31| That mechanism is nowhere in the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7051)|
| 1:57:33| I will tell you what mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7053)|
| 1:57:34| Thank you, Mr. Brad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7054)|
| 1:57:35| Brad, let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7055)|
| 1:57:36| I've got a few questions I want to ask you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7056)|
| 1:57:39| John, I believe I asked here at the last committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7059)|
| 1:57:43| They said you couldn't tell us how much they sold out there, but how much have we paid them for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7063)|
| 1:57:49| I believe somebody was supposed to get that for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7069)|
| 1:58:08| First of all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7088)|
| 1:58:12| we approve those payments as long as they're within our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7092)|
| 1:58:15| So if a request for payment comes to us, I approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7095)|
| 1:58:19| And John, I'm assuming, approved all those prior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7099)|
| 1:58:23| But Bruce did ask Diane in our office to prepare what we paid for tipping fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7103)|
| 1:58:35| When the county hauls wood there or anybody else, the school system, county parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7115)|
| 1:58:43| Now, I'm going to pass this out, but we have a special contract with the City of Oak Ridge where we're paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7123)|
| 1:58:56| I have a cubic yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7136)|
| 1:58:57| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| What we're paying them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| We pay 23 a ton to drop it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7143)|
| 1:59:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7148)|
| 1:59:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7149)|
| 1:59:10| How many tons have we sent out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| It's 251,000 over three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7152)|
| 1:59:18| Now, how do they pay us back by the ton on the dollar and a half?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7158)|
| 1:59:23| They're supposed to pay us a dollar and a half on everything that goes out the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7163)|
| 1:59:28| But there's a dispute over whether that is wood that's composted or wood that's chipped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7168)|
| 1:59:34| And that's, again, part of the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7174)|
| 1:59:37| Because there are several types of products they produce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7177)|
| 1:59:42| Some go through that full composting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7182)|
| 1:59:45| Others just go through the chipper and they die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7185)|
| 1:59:47| It's like, you know what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7187)|
| 1:59:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| I asked you here the other day now, last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7192)|
| 1:59:54| You'd been here, I believe you said, about eight weeks or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7194)|
| 1:59:57| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7197)|
| 1:59:58| Last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7198)|
| 1:59:59| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7199)|
| 2:00:00| Have you set up to see about collecting any money since you've been there since I asked you last month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7200)|
| 2:00:04| No, I have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7204)|
| 2:00:06| Well, apparently this is just going to continue to go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7206)|
| 2:00:09| Nobody seems to want to collect anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7209)|
| 2:00:11| Well, it's an issue of a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| Well, the lawsuit just started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7215)|
| 2:00:16| I know, but I talked with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7216)|
| 2:00:21| The lawsuit was unsealed the Friday before the Monday I started work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7221)|
| 2:00:27| So there was a lawsuit, and this lawsuit was, in effect, the first day I started this job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7227)|
| 2:00:37| Commissioner Smith, and please remember we're going to have a workshop on this on the 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7237)|
| 2:00:43| Well, that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7243)|
| 2:00:44| Mr. Law Director, if we've got a lawsuit, do we not need to get in the middle of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7244)|
| 2:00:49| Let the lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7249)|
| 2:00:56| I'm going to get to you, Bradley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7256)|
| 2:00:59| Advise us, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7259)|
| 2:01:00| We are engaged in a lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7260)|
| 2:01:05| I would prefer that these matters were fully discussed at a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7265)|
| 2:01:09| Well, you know, it may be, and what Dwight stated earlier about the status of this whole matter is accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7269)|
| 2:01:19| It may be that after that workshop we ask for a member of this body to try to resolve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7279)|
| 2:01:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7288)|
| 2:01:31| I can tell you that I can't respond to Mr. Mays, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7291)|
| 2:01:41| I can't sit here and debate him because he's represented by counsel and his counsel is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7301)|
| 2:01:47| So I cannot professionally engage in a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| So it does limit your counsel's ability to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7310)|
| 2:01:53| Well, it seems to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7313)|
| 2:01:55| Mr. Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7315)|
| 2:01:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7317)|
| 2:01:58| So if you think we need a workshop, then I'll go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7318)|
| 2:02:00| Bradley, I appreciate you coming out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7320)|
| 2:02:01| We spent a lot of time discussing these things and you opened my eyes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7321)|
| 2:02:06| I'm not an attorney, but you're giving, you're showing all your cards tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7326)|
| 2:02:12| I would hold, I would not say anything until, if you want this to go your way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7332)|
| 2:02:18| I wouldn't say another word because you're just giving them more ammunition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7338)|
| 2:02:23| We're going to have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7343)|
| 2:02:24| I mean, I'll say it at four o'clock in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7346)|
| 2:02:27| But if I were you, I wouldn't let anything happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7347)|
| 2:02:30| I've given one percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7350)|
| 2:02:31| Commissioner Lutho, there's only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7351)|
| 2:02:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| First off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080225businesspt.3?start=7356)|
