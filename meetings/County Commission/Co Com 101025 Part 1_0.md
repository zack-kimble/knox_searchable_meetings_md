| 0:04:31| I'll defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| I believe he's also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| Sir, do you have your certificate of registration and your business license, a copy of your business license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=274)|
| 0:04:41| Applicant, we've applied for those licenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=281)|
| 0:04:43| We haven't received them yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=283)|
| 0:04:44| We applied for them on October 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=284)|
| 0:04:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=286)|
| 0:04:49| Does anybody have any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| Mr. Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=290)|
| 0:04:51| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=291)|
| 0:04:52| Just clear up one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=292)|
| 0:04:54| On our sheet here it lists 10636 Hardin Valley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=294)|
| 0:04:59| 10639, which is correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=299)|
| 0:05:04| 10639.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=304)|
| 0:05:06| Yeah, 10639 is listed on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| Sometimes it's hard to tell zeros from nines, maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=312)|
| 0:05:15| But it's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=315)|
| 0:05:16| So it's supposed to be 3-9 on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=316)|
| 0:05:18| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=324)|
| 0:05:28| I'd like to make a motion to approve based on the training, certificate of registration, and the business license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=328)|
| 0:05:33| And all other pending construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=333)|
| 0:05:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=337)|
| 0:05:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=338)|
| 0:05:40| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=340)|
| 0:05:41| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=343)|
| 0:05:44| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| I believe those are all the applications we have, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=347)|
| 0:05:50| Deferred discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| Discuss what action the commission deems appropriate regarding dormant beer applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=351)|
| 0:05:59| I think we'd ask the law director to kind of look into it last month if there's anything that we could do or through state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=359)|
| 0:06:07| or county code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=367)|
| 0:06:09| No, essentially, commissioners, some counties will require reapplication after a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=369)|
| 0:06:17| If you've got a bona fide property and you feel it's appropriate to allow it to remain dormant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=377)|
| 0:06:24| but you can certainly put a time limit on that if you think it's unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=384)|
| 0:06:28| But there's nothing that compels you one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| Mr. Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=393)|
| 0:06:34| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=394)|
| 0:06:36| I believe this came up within the last 12 months that there was a permit request, was in a district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=396)|
| 0:06:46| And one of the fellow commissioners made the comment that it may be a while before that particular establishment was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=406)|
| 0:06:55| opened and they wanted to make sure that they would be paying the whatever appropriate fee is on the annual renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=415)|
| 0:07:03| Is that like $100?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=423)|
| 0:07:05| So that one went right through with the attachment that the $100 fee be paid every year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=425)|
| 0:07:13| even though it was laying there dormant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| And I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=435)|
| 0:07:16| I think what's come up now is the fact that there are several other laying in that same circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=436)|
| 0:07:23| And I believe it would be appropriate if we're doing it, if we're asking one vendor to be paying just as though they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=443)|
| 0:07:32| the permit and in actuality they do have a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=452)|
| 0:07:37| The $100 a year to keep the permit valid is probably a valid request on our part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=457)|
| 0:07:46| So therein we need some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| Either we need to be charging everyone every year or we need to be letting this other one off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| from whatever we had started a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=477)|
| 0:08:00| The $100, from what I understand from the clerk's office, is a state privilege tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=480)|
| 0:08:05| So it doesn't go to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=485)|
| 0:08:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=486)|
| 0:08:07| It's based on an approved beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| Well, they don't have an approved beer permit without certification of construction occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=489)|
| 0:08:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| So that's not a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| And so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=499)|
| 0:08:21| Joe, do you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| What beer permit was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| Do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| Which one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| Waggles on Ellistown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Is that the one we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| That's right, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| Yes, that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| Commissioner, are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| Do we need to make a decision to be the same across the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=516)|
| 0:08:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=521)|
| 0:08:42| I could draft essentially an amendment giving you several options to review at your next meeting, if you like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=522)|
| 0:08:49| Because I know the chairman likewise inquired into this and obviously he's not here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=529)|
| 0:08:53| But I'll defer to the commission's desires.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| I agree with Commissioner Ryan and also what the law director said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=540)|
| 0:09:04| The list that I saw, there was at least a couple of them on there that were more than two years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=544)|
| 0:09:10| So we need to have some consistency in what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| And what you're saying is if that's going to the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=555)|
| 0:09:18| and we can't collect that until they actually have their permit in hand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| and they can't have that until they get to construction, then, you know, our hands are tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=563)|
| 0:09:28| They may just be laying in limbo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| I think it's an order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=571)|
| 0:09:34| We would have to draft an ordinance, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=574)|
| 0:09:36| Well, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=576)|
| 0:09:37| We would essentially have to amend your current code by way of ordinance because it's promulgated by an ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=577)|
| 0:09:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| But going which way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| To amend the code to do what now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| To decide whether or not we want to charge a fee or not charge a fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| So we had not been charging a fee and we only did it to this one particular one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=595)|
| 0:10:03| Could the county charge a fee for, in a sense, babysitting it for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=603)|
| 0:10:11| Well, we'd have to create an ordinance to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=611)|
| 0:10:13| Would that be something that would be possible, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=613)|
| 0:10:17| I'd like to look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=617)|
| 0:10:18| But essentially, it would require an ordinance change because, again, your code is promulgated by ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| But I can give you some options, what I think is legally defensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=623)|
| 0:10:27| You know, a lot of it is just, you know, the yearly and annual housekeeping,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=627)|
| 0:10:32| trying to keep tabs on these so when they do come up with a three-year-old beer permit, we want to ensure by,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| you know, what happens during that time, the land use changes, elementary school is erected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=638)|
| 0:10:46| do we start getting into grandfathering issues?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=646)|
| 0:10:49| So it's going to bear a little bit of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=649)|
| 0:10:52| It seems simplistic, but it does bear some legal research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| Well, we could adopt it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| I mean, here again, we're thinking outside the box here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| We could adopt the process of saying, okay, you can get this issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=659)|
| 0:11:03| but it's going to be good for six months, nine months, what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| If you're not complete by then, then you're going to need to reapply or, you know, for a new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=667)|
| 0:11:16| Anybody who's going into business surely would know within nine months whether they're going to be able to open or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=676)|
| 0:11:24| I'll take that as my marching orders to give you some options, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| This is sort of a change in subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| I know it's not on the agenda, but it's sort of a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=693)|
| 0:11:37| This is Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| On the commission forum, there's a letter or information concerning how we may change the policy of the beer board inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=699)|
| 0:11:55| I would like to see whatever change is being made be held in abeyance until such time as it's on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=715)|
| 0:12:03| I believe this body sets the policy and changing whatever policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=723)|
| 0:12:09| I don't know what the policy might have been in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| but we need to discuss that before we get into what the new policy might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=732)|
| 0:12:19| And since it was just posted on the forum saying this is something to discuss and I'm not saying we should discuss it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=739)|
| 0:12:27| well, I guess that's what I'm saying is it's probably not up for discussion because it's not on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=747)|
| 0:12:34| and changing the policy needs to be something that comes through this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=754)|
| 0:12:38| I know, sir, that I've not been asked to take any affirmative action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| and I haven't proposed any changes whatsoever, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=761)|
| 0:12:45| We can morally discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| We had discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=768)|
| 0:12:49| We've had a few instances where essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=769)|
| 0:12:52| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| It's not on the agenda today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| And I also, again, I'll defer to the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=779)|
| 0:13:02| but I know the chairman likewise has some interest in this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| It isn't on your agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| You can certainly amend your rules to add it to the agenda if you feel comfortable discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| and you have sufficient information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=792)|
| 0:13:14| But I'll defer to the commission on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| Let's finish the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=797)|
| 0:13:18| Is there any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| I think right now on the topic of dormant beer permits, is there any more discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=799)|
| 0:13:26| The law director is going to look and define a policy or check our options, rather, for the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=806)|
| 0:13:36| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=816)|
| 0:13:38| We need to, I guess we need to, if we want to have a discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| we need to suspend or amendment to the agenda or suspend the rules of the agenda to add it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=821)|
| 0:13:48| Which would you prefer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| Well, you'd have to suspend the rules and then two-thirds vote will get it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=830)|
| 0:13:55| Do I hear a motion to suspend the rules to discuss beer inspector on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=835)|
| 0:14:06| Then you are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=846)|
| 0:14:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=847)|
| 0:14:08| We're adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=848)|
| 0:14:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| I'll ask the Knox County Commission to order for the October meeting, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| Would the commissioners take their seats?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=854)|
| 0:14:27| Madam Clerk, will you take the roll?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=867)|

| 0:14:52| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=892)|

| 0:14:54| We have a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| This month's, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| This month's devotional is led by Commissioner Amy Burleson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=901)|
| 0:15:04| Commissioner Burleson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=904)|
| 0:15:06| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=906)|

| 0:15:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=911)|
| 0:15:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| I don't recall being invited to give the devotional or replying to anyone that I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=917)|
| 0:15:26| But I do appreciate the opportunity to speak to everyone, and I wish I'd had the opportunity to be prepared| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| and invite someone who is a better speaker than I am on the topics of spirituality and how we treat each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=933)|
| 0:15:52| And I think that I'm very blessed to be working with this particular group of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=952)|

| 0:16:34| and make decisions on behalf of the residents of Knox County who have placed their trust in us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=994)|

| 0:20:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| I was wondering, you know, I know there's one pretty, well, item that will bring a little debate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1236)|
| 0:20:44| and that's the Cherokee issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1244)|
| 0:20:45| I wonder if we can move that forward in the agenda as close as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| What item is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1249)|

| 0:21:11| I'll get it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1271)|

| 0:21:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1281)|
| 0:21:24| We're going to move it to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1284)|
| 0:21:32| We're going to do it before consent because he needs to leave here in a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| Does anybody else have any additions to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1295)|

| 0:21:43| This may be a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| I was just trying to get some follow-up on where we stood on the resolution that we passed last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| to look at all possible financing for the security center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1310)|
| 0:21:58| It's in the mayor's court now, the justice center and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| It's not in our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| It's got to be researched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1325)|
| 0:22:06| And it's back to the Justice Committee and the mayor's office to do some research on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1326)|
| 0:22:11| I didn't know if we have a justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| I'm on the Justice Committee, but I haven't heard that we're having a meeting or any discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1333)|
| 0:22:17| I think they're still looking into the funding issues with the Title VI funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1337)|
| 0:22:23| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1343)|
| 0:22:34| We have the two health department issues that were added from the last meeting, the workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| Those are added to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1359)|
| 0:22:48| Does anybody have the Boothold Amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1368)|

| 0:23:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1404)|
| 0:23:25| Let's move the Cherokee health issue to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1405)|
| 0:23:28| Commissioner McKenzie has to leave for a meeting, so I'd like to move that to the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| Madam Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1411)|
| 0:23:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1412)|
| 0:23:33| That's Resolution 601.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| It's located on page 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1414)|
| 0:23:36| It is approving a contract with Cherokee Health Systems for a primary care provider for children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1416)|
| 0:23:41| on TennCare, Cover Kids, or those without insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1421)|
| 0:23:49| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1429)|
| 0:23:53| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| I'd like to hear from PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| We asked for somebody from PBA to be here to talk about the contract or whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1436)|
| 0:24:03| We specifically asked for PBA to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| Go ahead, Dr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| I specifically asked for PBA to be here as well and was advised that they would have somebody here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1448)|
| 0:24:15| Well, it may be they thought it was going up later on in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1455)|
| 0:24:18| Maybe that's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| I've been given earlier just a few minutes ago and had a meeting with Cherokee this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1460)|
| 0:24:26| There were some amendments that they made to the contract that I'll go ahead and discuss with you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1466)|
| 0:24:37| In regards to the rent, we spoke about the federally qualified health care center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1477)|
| 0:24:44| The contract has been amended to say that Knox County will not charge the contractor for rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1484)|
| 0:24:49| utilities, or services maintenance for 60 days until 60 days after they have qualified for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1489)|
| 0:24:55| federal health center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1495)|
| 0:25:00| And 60 days after that, they will pay the PBA rent rate for that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1500)|
| 0:25:07| whatever the rent rate is for that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| Also, to have discussion with them on the current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1512)|
| 0:25:19| They made a gesture of changing the contract to we'll retain all current clinic employees for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1519)|
| 0:25:24| minimum of one year following all labor policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1524)|
| 0:25:27| So as long as they are, as long as the employees are, they can't fire anybody without just calls for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1527)|
| 0:25:36| one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| Yeah, Commissioner Brown and I met with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| Is Dr. Freeman here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1543)|
| 0:25:44| Is he here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1544)|
| 0:25:45| We met with Dr. Freeman on Wednesday and had a good meeting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1545)|
| 0:25:49| I was concerned and Commissioner Brown, well, several commissioners were concerned about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1549)|
| 0:25:54| employees and that they were able to make a lateral transfer and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| But they're going from a group of eight people to it looks like a group, was it 541, Mike?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1558)|
| 0:26:02| Is that how many was in that group, something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| Close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1564)|
| 0:26:05| Over 500.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1565)|
| 0:26:06| So, you know, that made me feel good that, well, there's a chance for advancement for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1566)|
| 0:26:09| individuals so they can maybe make some advances and make more money there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| But I do have some questions and I'll yield until PBA gets here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| One of the issues that we brought up in a meeting with Dr. Freeman last week was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1583)|
| 0:26:29| benefits of the employees were in the county versus going with Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1589)|
| 0:26:34| And Dr. Freeman was going to have a comparison sheet made up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| Do you have that, Dr. Buchanan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| Do you want to pass those out or I can help you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| I'll start them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1605)|
| 0:27:16| So this was put together with coordination between Knox County Human Resources and Cherokee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1636)|
| 0:27:25| Health Human Resources trying to summarize the benefits for the employees comparing health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1645)|
| 0:27:34| insurance, life insurance, days of accrual per year, and holidays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| And so I left the names off just for privacy reasons, but these are the positions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| will be transferring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| There are a total of seven folks who will be transferring to Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| And if you'll note, most of them will actually pay less for their benefits at Cherokee than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1671)|
| 0:27:58| they do with Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| There are three of them who will pay a little bit more, the most being $396.90 spread over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1680)|
| 0:28:07| the entire year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| And I realize y'all are just now getting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1691)|
| 0:28:18| We had, I guess, about an hour meeting with Dr. Freeman and also one of the current county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1698)|
| 0:28:25| employees that will be moving over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1705)|
| 0:28:29| I believe she's here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1709)|
| 0:28:31| I saw her earlier out in the back, Ms. Jackson back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1711)|
| 0:28:39| The biggest contention that we heard from the county employee side was a number of vacation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1719)|
| 0:28:46| days or comp time or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1726)|
| 0:28:50| But I think that was only a difference when you figure it down the proper way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1730)|
| 0:28:55| It only comes down to maybe one or two days a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| So I'm comfortable with this myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| And, you know, it's kind of a shot or a leap of faith for both parties in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1741)|
| 0:29:10| I mean, certainly Cherokee is no stranger to dealing with pediatric patients because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1750)|
| 0:29:17| they have that availability through their system there now where they do the pediatrics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| and also the adults.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| So, I mean, it's a natural fit to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| And I'd like to make a motion that we approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1767)|
| 0:29:31| I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| Is that with the amendments to the 60 days and the one year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| They're willing to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| I mean, Joe, is that his name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1784)|
| 0:29:47| Joel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1787)|
| 0:29:48| Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| I think we're very agreeable, at least in our meeting, with doing whatever it takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| to make the thing work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1797)|
| 0:29:59| I mean, everybody's going to have, it's kind of hard to have everything cut and dried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| You're going to have some little glitches that are going to need to be repaired along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1807)|
| 0:30:08| But I honestly believe after talking with them that they are dedicated to doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1808)|
| 0:30:15| Another thing that came up in question before was the length of time it took to get an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1815)|
| 0:30:20| appointment with Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| Well, in talking with the county employees, if it's not an emergency, the times of getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1821)|
| 0:30:29| appointments are just about the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1829)|
| 0:30:31| So that's a non-issue right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1831)|
| 0:30:34| So, anyway, I support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1840)|
| 0:30:41| I wanted to say thanks to Mike for including the county employees in the discussions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1841)|
| 0:30:48| you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1848)|
| 0:30:49| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1849)|
| 0:30:51| And I wish that we had gotten this a little bit earlier because I would like some time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1851)|
| 0:30:57| to discuss this or to study it and discuss it a little bit because I know there was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1857)|
| 0:31:04| very large discrepancy in terms of retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| And has that been worked out to the employees' satisfaction or is that still an issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1869)|
| 0:31:18| This is Jeff Howard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1878)|
| 0:31:19| He's with Cherokee and he can address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1879)|
| 0:31:22| I think there was some confusion over the retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| I don't think it's as big a discrepancy as it appeared to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1885)|
| 0:31:29| He can explain how they do their retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1889)|
| 0:31:34| Jeff Howard from Morristown, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1894)|
| 0:31:37| With regard to our retirement plan, the Cherokee retirement plan, Cherokee contributes 3%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1897)|
| 0:31:43| automatically and then matches up to another 3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1903)|
| 0:31:47| So the maximum contribution from Cherokee would be 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| But the employee can deduct as much as they want up to the legal limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| So that's the same as the county pension, I believe, 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| No, it's not, apparently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| I think the difference comes with the length of time, the length of employment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| Frances, I hate to put you on the spot, but could you clarify this for us, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1933)|
| 0:32:38| Frances Fogerson from Human Resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| To do my best, retirement is not part of Human Resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1965)|
| 0:32:46| We do have 6% mandatory with a 6% match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| But with certain stages of longevity, you can make contributions into a different plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1970)|
| 0:32:58| and receive matches, 2%, 4%, and 6% as it progresses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1978)|
| 0:33:06| But it's not in the same account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1986)|
| 0:33:10| So we do have an opportunity for additional, but it comes at separate stages of longevity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1990)|
| 0:33:17| And so for some of these employees who have been county employees for decades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=1997)|
| 0:33:22| that is a significant benefit that they receive at this point that they would be giving up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2002)|
| 0:33:29| if they moved to Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| I do have a printout, and there is an employee here who is contributing an additional 15%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2013)|
| 0:33:44| and receiving the additional 6% match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2024)|
| 0:33:48| Our cap is 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| Let me see if there's another employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| But that's an additional to the original 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2038)|
| 0:33:59| For each and every one, you have the 6% with the mandatory 6% employee contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2039)|
| 0:34:05| that's matched by the employer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| So that can be quite significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2047)|
| 0:34:09| And there appears to be another employee who is contributing an additional 2%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| with the 2% match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2054)|
| 0:34:16| And that can be quite significant as you're moving towards retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2056)|
| 0:34:20| especially when we look at what's happened recently with people's 401ks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2060)|
| 0:34:25| and all of those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| The additional match is important to many employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| I personally would be very hesitant to take that away from someone at this point in their career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| who has been a loyal county employee all this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| I'm very concerned about how we're treating our employees at the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| And I'm very reluctant to take that away from an employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2088)|
| 0:34:56| unless there is some kind of compensation that Cherokee is willing to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| that the county employee finds acceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| So I would either vote no or I would offer a substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| that we defer this for another 30 days to give us an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| to study this new information and to perhaps allow Cherokee and the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| to continue working on something that is acceptable to both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| You know, we'd have to talk to the people that do retirement plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| You know, being in private business myself is that I don't think you can take a select group of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| and give them special retirement plans and not give it to others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2137)|
| 0:35:41| And so I don't think, I mean, quite frankly, I don't think that's going to be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2141)|
| 0:35:46| If you did, what would happen is all the executives would get a 50% match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| and all the employees would get a 1% match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| When you're looking at 8 versus 541.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2152)|
| 0:35:56| That's not permitted under a lot of the ERISA laws, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2156)|
| 0:35:59| I should have been more specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2159)|
| 0:36:01| Not that Cherokee would match the county's retirement program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| but that they would offer some other benefit or form of compensation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| in lieu of that type of retirement benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2172)|
| 0:36:16| Again, I think you'd probably have to have retirement special lawyers look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2176)|
| 0:36:21| I may be wrong, but I know in our company, when we've looked at trying to do something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| it's just not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2186)|
| 0:36:29| The bottom line is that I think we would be taking away a significant benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| from a loyal county employee who has spent her career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2194)|
| 0:36:40| or their careers here for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2200)|
| 0:36:43| And we would be taking a significant benefit away from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| And I'm not, absolutely not, in favor of treating our county employees in that manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2208)|
| 0:36:53| Dr. Brady, are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2213)|
| 0:36:56| Mike Brown, you had your light on, are you done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2220)|
| 0:37:02| You know, any time that you make a move, a lateral move, a move up, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| there's always changes that have to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| We set up here as a governing body and we have to look at the overall picture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| and the economic situation of the county and the county's finances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| And, again, any time you make a job change, you're not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2241)|
| 0:37:28| well, let's go back for a little bit further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| None of us are guaranteed a job tomorrow, as far as that's concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| You either got a contract, you get it bought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| Or if you don't have a contract, they can say you're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| So, in looking at this whole thing, I think that this is a pretty good package for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2260)|
| 0:37:47| Cherokee doesn't have a cap on what the employee can contribute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| If they want to add that extra in there those last several years, they can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| So I still see it as a win-win situation for both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2274)|
| 0:38:02| Ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2282)|
| 0:38:03| I'm Jane Barrett with PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2283)|
| 0:38:05| I apologize for being late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2285)|
| 0:38:07| Mike, are you finished?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2287)|
| 0:38:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| Can you tell us about, Jane, can you tell us about the contract with PBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| and then what we're looking at and when things will happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| Just give us a rundown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| For PBA, on the health departments, that was changed back when the libraries were taken back by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| So we manage maintenance and security functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2306)|
| 0:38:30| Under our numbers, you would see any of the maintenance items, any of the facility-respected items,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2310)|
| 0:38:36| like your elevators, fire panels, camera systems, all of those things are under us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2316)|
| 0:38:44| Now, the cost that you saw, I believe, include the utilities and then those figures that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2324)|
| 0:38:51| And that came at what, about $10 a square foot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2333)|
| 0:38:54| I've got $7.56.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2334)|
| 0:38:56| $7.56?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2336)|
| 0:38:58| The total cost overall is $9.68 per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2338)|
| 0:39:02| The county has their own people-managing custodial and grounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2342)|
| 0:39:07| And then they also pay the utilities directly, but those are figured into our budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2347)|
| 0:39:13| So if you're taking into consideration what county is going to pay for KUB, what they pay for security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2353)|
| 0:39:21| elevator services, how much does that come out to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| The figures here were $9.68 a square foot, so close to your number, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| All I'm saying is on the PVA side, we are just managing today security, life safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2370)|
| 0:39:35| the operations as far as facility services, HVAC, equipment needs, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2375)|
| 0:39:42| How come you're letting it go for so cheap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2382)|
| 0:39:45| We're just trying to do a really good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2385)|
| 0:39:48| Well, I mean, this is Knox County's building, and we have to be good stewards of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2388)|
| 0:39:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| I don't set those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2395)|
| 0:39:57| From my understanding, what we charge back is the cost of operations and maintenance to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| It's like we do in most of our facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| We're not charging you a per-rent fee plus CAM charges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| We're specifically charging you what it costs to operate and maintain the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| But the taxpayers built that building, and they paid for that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| And I just have a hard – I mean, I want to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2415)|
| 0:40:20| I think it's a good idea, but I don't want to give away the farm because what concerns me is next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2420)|
| 0:40:25| somebody else is going to come, hey, Knox County's giving away office space at $7.50 a square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| and they pay for everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2429)|
| 0:40:31| I just – I have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| But, I mean, I want them to have a decent deal on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| But that's – I'm sort of like Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| I'm starting to have a little bit of heartburn over some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2440)|
| 0:40:45| I mean, who authorizes you to give this away at $7 a square foot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2445)|
| 0:40:50| That's just the charge I'm passing through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2450)|
| 0:40:52| I didn't set the rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| That is our cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| And I don't know that there's a rate established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2456)|
| 0:40:59| Sir, for the record, would you state your name and address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| Gary Acuff, Knox County Health Department, 140 Dameron Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| I don't think there's been a rate to charge for the actual rental as yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| So that's negotiable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| Well, see, then that's just throwing it out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| You want us to vote on stuff that – you should have these details worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2474)|
| 0:41:19| what it's going to cost them, what we're going to be charging them in rent come next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2479)|
| 0:41:24| I mean, you may give them $2 a square foot for all we know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| So, you know, I'd like to – Mayor, I'd like to hear from Mr. Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2490)|
| 0:41:36| Would you like to – I'd like to hear just a little bit from your concerns, Mr. Burchett, on some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| What's your feelings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| You know, Mayor, here's why you're coming to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2507)|
| 0:41:55| You know, Knox County's taxpayers paid for that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2515)|
| 0:41:59| and we don't know what we're really going to charge for rent in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| It seems our own commercial space, and we're basically giving the space away at dirt cheap cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2523)|
| 0:42:11| I'm just a little bit uneasy with how we're doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2531)|
| 0:42:16| And what I'm uneasy with, Mayor, is we're passing this that, well, we'll decide that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2536)|
| 0:42:22| We'll decide what we're going to do with the employees later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2542)|
| 0:42:24| We've not even got that squared away yet today, and we don't know what the rent's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| I think we need to – I mean, almost 7,000 square foot, that's an awful lot of office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2548)|
| 0:42:33| An awful lot of office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| So I just wondered if you had any concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| Well, I appreciate your concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2558)|
| 0:42:40| Tim Burchett, County Mayor, 6401 Airtree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| Sorry, I forgot about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| We've actually, I think, have been working with these folks –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2566)|
| 0:42:50| or trying to work with these folks for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2570)|
| 0:42:52| I think we've come a long way in these discussions, and I think we're ready to move ahead with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2572)|
| 0:42:58| I mean, I know we're going to argue back and forth about some of the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| but I think we need to put this to rest and move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| That's my opinion, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| Mayor, and I understand that, but what comes back to bite us is when,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| three or four years from now, we're running for something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| and say, well, you gave William Knox County Health Department space at whatever so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| We have to be responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| You know, the buck stops with us when it comes to some of this stuff, too, and I just want us to –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2602)|
| 0:43:26| Ultimately, it'll stop with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2606)|
| 0:43:29| If there's been some miscommunications or something that you think has been done that is dishonest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2609)|
| 0:43:36| you can put it on my back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| I'll take the blame on this if there is any to blame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| but I think that we've come a long way in these discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| I go back to my original statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2626)|
| 0:43:49| I think that we're ready to move forward with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| I know that some people have some individual issues, but I think we can work all those out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| I had a lawyer one time tell me, good fences make good neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| and we need to, of course, get everything hashed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2641)|
| 0:44:04| I'm not trying to brush over anything, but I would sure like to see this issue taken care of today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| Well, Mr. Mayor, I think that you're real sincere about what you're wanting to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2651)|
| 0:44:15| and in your campaign how you want the best for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2655)|
| 0:44:19| I'm real comfortable with that, with what your stance are on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2659)|
| 0:44:23| So I'm going to trust you and your administration that when the time comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| that your administration will make sure that Knox County –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| I mean, we don't have to give the farm away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| I'm not charging $25 a square foot, but that you'll do something that we can all stand behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| I can assure you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| It'll be very transparent and you'll know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| Like I said, if there's a problem, you just blame it on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| I'll explain it if it needs to be explained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2684)|
| 0:44:48| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2688)|
| 0:44:50| Commissioner Brewers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| Mike, I understand what you're saying about making a move to a new job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2695)|
| 0:44:59| but this is not a move that they asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| This is something that they are being forced to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| It's not voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| And I agree that we need to hash out the details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2708)|
| 0:45:13| but I think that we need to do that before we pass this, not after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2713)|
| 0:45:19| And I appreciate the mayor's stance that he'll take the blame,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2719)|
| 0:45:24| but it's not his retirement that is the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2724)|
| 0:45:28| And yes, they can put in however much that they want out of their money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2728)|
| 0:45:34| but it's not being matched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| And that's what they're losing is the matching money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| And that's significant to someone who's approaching retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| And I'm not willing to do that to these employees who have been so dedicated to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2741)|
| 0:45:47| I don't think that that's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| And I also share Commissioner Smith's concerns about what we're doing with the rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2749)|
| 0:45:59| And I don't think the time to hash out these details is after we pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| I think it's before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2764)|
| 0:46:07| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2767)|
| 0:46:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2768)|
| 0:46:09| Where do I start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| First off, let's go back to the PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| Number one, the PBA is not in business to make money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| They're managing properties for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| So whatever the going rate is, that's the rate that they're going to be charged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2780)|
| 0:46:26| In regards to your comments, Amy, in regards to the retirement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2786)|
| 0:46:33| we don't have, any county employee does not have a guarantee that three years from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| five years from now, that we're going to be able to put that 6% or 3% or whatever it is in there to match them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2798)|
| 0:46:45| Nobody can forecast that future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2805)|
| 0:46:48| Anytime you move, again, as I say, you're taking, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| recently we've had jobs that have been discontinued within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2814)|
| 0:47:00| Those people were let go because there was no place else to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| These folks have a place to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| They're being treated, what I feel, equally and fairly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| When you consider they're going in eight among 541,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2831)|
| 0:47:15| you can't make the 541 totally equal to the eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2835)|
| 0:47:19| I mean, it's an impossible business decision to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2839)|
| 0:47:22| I feel like that this is the best thing for both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| And again, I call for the question, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2846)|
| 0:47:31| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2851)|
| 0:47:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| Vote on the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2853)|

| 0:47:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2857)|
| 0:47:38| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2858)|
| 0:47:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2859)|
| 0:47:41| Roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| Mr. McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2864)|
| 0:47:46| This is only for the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| An aye vote is voting for the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2870)|
| 0:47:51| Mr. McKenzie votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| I'm voting no because there was still a commissioner with his light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2874)|
| 0:47:57| Commissioner Broyles votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2877)|

| 0:48:04| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2884)|
| 0:48:05| Commissioner Ombi votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2885)|
| 0:48:06| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2887)|
| 0:48:08| Commissioner Briggs votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2888)|
| 0:48:09| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| Commissioner Anders votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| Commissioner Smith votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2897)|
| 0:48:18| Pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| Commissioner Wright passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2901)|
| 0:48:22| Commissioner Brown votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2902)|
| 0:48:23| Commissioner Schaaf?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| Commissioner Schaaf votes no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| Does the pass wish to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2906)|
| 0:48:27| Pass wish to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2907)|
| 0:48:30| Seven-two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| Two-seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2913)|
| 0:48:34| Two-seven, the call fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2914)|
| 0:48:35| Two-seven to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2917)|
| 0:48:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| The reason I passed is because I thought it was a conflict of interest if I voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| I must reveal that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| I wanted to speak just a moment to the issue of rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2927)|
| 0:48:52| And I find myself on the other side of the fence from the Honorable Commissioner from the 7th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2932)|
| 0:49:02| I don't know that rent even has a place in this because as it occurs right now, Knox County is sitting in a Knox County building taking care of Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2942)|
| 0:49:18| In the future, it will be Knox County through a contractor taking care of Knox County citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2958)|
| 0:49:26| So where does rent come into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2966)|
| 0:49:30| Now, let me go to the other side for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| If Cherokee is going to turn around and bill someone for the right to have space, in other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2973)|
| 0:49:42| they're going to send a bill to the federal government or to an insurance carrier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2982)|
| 0:49:46| or to someone to come up with the funds that would have paid rent, even though they're not paying rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2986)|
| 0:49:55| then they'd have more money on their bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| That's probably not right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=2998)|
| 0:50:00| But if they're a 501c3, if they're taking the place, if they're taking Knox County current employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3000)|
| 0:50:06| and transitioning them into their employment and providing service to Knox County citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3006)|
| 0:50:14| then someone's got to be paying the incremental additional expense that's created if we add $7 a square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3014)|
| 0:50:23| or $10 a square foot or $25 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| I find it irrelevant what the charge is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| I just kind of disagree with the element of the fact that we are going to charge Cherokee rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3033)|
| 0:50:42| and Cherokee is going to provide a service to Knox County citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3042)|
| 0:50:46| and Knox County citizens and have to pay that incremental larger expense so we can get our rent money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3046)|
| 0:50:53| I just find there's something in there that doesn't really play well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3053)|
| 0:50:56| But I can support this if we're dealing with PBA figures about what the cost of the space is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3056)|
| 0:51:06| And I see that Dr. Buchanan is going to correct me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| No, I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3069)|
| 0:51:11| I'm going to make a suggestion for Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| Would you feel more comfortable if the language read that they would pay fees at the current PBA rate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3075)|
| 0:51:22| The reason I left it open is for the possibility of a change in PBA's fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3082)|
| 0:51:27| I don't know how often their fees are looked at and how often they change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3087)|
| 0:51:30| So if we locked in at what we currently pay just to cover the cost, which is our plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| cover our cost for that space, if we lock in at where we are now, what if it goes up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3095)|
| 0:51:40| Then we don't have any, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| So the reason to leave it open was to say whatever they're currently charging us in a year, whatever that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3102)|
| 0:51:48| that's what they would pay based on our current fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3108)|
| 0:51:51| I think that would, if she addressed me, I think that would be fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3111)|
| 0:51:56| I'd like for you to move $640 million if you wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| Who made the motion to accept the amendments, to approve with the amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3120)|
| 0:52:05| Do you accept that current rent, Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3125)|
| 0:52:10| Before we vote, I want to make a statement about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| I have struggled drastically with this decision because I think it affects people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3134)|
| 0:52:20| and I think every time we affect people, we need to take them into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3140)|
| 0:52:24| I think that Cherokee has made some substantial concessions since the previous contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3144)|
| 0:52:31| or the first contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3151)|
| 0:52:32| I didn't like the first contract and I made no bones about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| But guarantee these employees a job as long as they're consistent employees for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3156)|
| 0:52:42| And that gives us the ability a year from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3162)|
| 0:52:44| This contract is year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| And that gives us the ability to renew or not renew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3166)|
| 0:52:48| And so I think we need to look at the, I mean, if you're going to vote for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| I think you need to understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3173)|
| 0:52:54| The Cherokees, under the meeting I had with them this morning, they know that I'm watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3174)|
| 0:52:59| And I think we as a commission need to watch our contracts after we approve them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| And so I just want to make that statement that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3183)|
| 0:53:05| this is not a contract that is good for everybody, but it's good for most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3185)|
| 0:53:09| And I think that's what we have to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3189)|
| 0:53:13| Just one final comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3193)|
| 0:53:14| I did ask Dr. Freeman the other day that they would give us like a six-month progress report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3194)|
| 0:53:24| Commissioner Burles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3207)|
| 0:53:28| I appreciate that the people up here feel like these employees are being treated fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3208)|
| 0:53:36| And I'm not going to put anybody on the spot by asking them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| but I don't think the bottom line should be whether we think they're being treated fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| I think it's important to ascertain whether or not they feel that they've been treated fairly here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3225)|
| 0:53:52| We have information that's just come to us in terms of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3232)|
| 0:53:59| which is three pages of information that we haven't had any time to review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| The information about the discrepancy in the retirement plans just came today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3245)|
| 0:54:14| And if you all are comfortable moving forward without, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3254)|
| 0:54:22| I really feel like we are not doing our due diligence for these people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3262)|
| 0:54:29| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3269)|
| 0:54:30| I think this is a good deal for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| but I'm not sure that we shouldn't take one more look at this before we pass it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3273)|
| 0:54:41| especially in terms of the new information that we've just received today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| that honestly none of us have had an adequate time to really take a look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3284)|
| 0:54:51| and understand what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| And I think that we all need to be aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3293)|
| 0:54:56| Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3296)|
| 0:54:58| Just a point of clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3298)|
| 0:54:59| You actually received a smaller version of the same information without as much detail previously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3299)|
| 0:55:06| just because you had asked for a cost comparison, which is what you got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| And this is just the same cost comparison with a little more detail in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| So I do apologize that you got that much information late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3311)|
| 0:55:15| Dr. Buchanan, on the comparisons of PTO, whenever you talk about Knox versus Cherokee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3315)|
| 0:55:23| when you do PTO for Knox County, you're doing annual NSIC together on their days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| or are you just doing it annually?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3327)|
| 0:55:29| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3329)|
| 0:55:30| You're losing me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3330)|
| 0:55:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| You say that on the OPM position on the back, it says PTO per year based on years of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| 17 days with Cherokee, 14 days in Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| Now, those 14 days in Knox, that's not annual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| That's annual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| And what about sick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3345)|
| 0:55:47| That's not the same as PTO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| So, I mean, PTO is sick and leave, sick and annual together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| So those are just annual days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| Yes, you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3355)|
| 0:55:56| So there is a discrepancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| You're not counting sick leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3359)|
| 0:56:00| You're just counting annual leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3360)|
| 0:56:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3361)|
| 0:56:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3362)|
| 0:56:13| We've got a motion on the floor and we have a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3373)|

| 0:56:28| Keep the employees for a year, the current and the rent and the fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3388)|
| 0:56:32| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3392)|

| 1:02:01| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| Commission, I come before you today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3725)|
| 1:02:09| As most of you have heard, we've had several variance requests that have created quite a stir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3729)|
| 1:02:16| And as we began looking at ordinances really about a year and a half ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3736)|
| 1:02:22| John Schoonmaker, who's my Vice Chair on the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3742)|
| 1:02:27| as we began to look at a lot of the ordinances, what we found out was that this book of ordinances was written 30 to 50 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3747)|
| 1:02:41| Now, I know nothing has changed in the last 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| Definitely my hair color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| But think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3768)|
| 1:02:50| You know, 30 years ago, we didn't have cell phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| We didn't have laptop computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3773)|
| 1:02:56| Well, guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| Construction and zoning ordinances obviously have needed to change to keep up with the way that construction has changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3777)|
| 1:03:07| Thirty years ago, most residential lots, half acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3787)|
| 1:03:12| Today, you'd be lucky to find very many that are a quarter acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3792)|
| 1:03:16| So, obviously, setbacks affect whether or not a person can put in a pool in a backyard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3796)|
| 1:03:24| whether or not they can extend their deck, whether they can have a covered porch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3804)|
| 1:03:30| And as I spoke to the commissioner earlier, an example of one that probably needs to be changed as well is a marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3810)|
| 1:03:41| If you have a boat dock at your home, it's considered a marina.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| Well, call a local insurance agent and find out what it costs to insure a marina versus your own private boat dock or a boathouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3827)|
| 1:03:57| You know, a lot of this stuff is so antiquated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| And for years, the VZA has approved practically anything, which is not in keeping with the ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3840)|
| 1:04:09| If you look at it and you read it, the law director's office has been most gracious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3849)|
| 1:04:14| in trying to help educate the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3854)|
| 1:04:18| And the issue is we've done things for so long that it's almost become an accepted practice to do them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3858)|
| 1:04:25| What I'm asking the commission to do, let's take a look at our ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3865)|
| 1:04:32| Let's take a look at our laws on how we build and what we approve and disapprove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3872)|
| 1:04:38| Every citizen deserves to know that when they come before the Board of Zoning Appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3878)|
| 1:04:43| that they have a fair chance and they understand what the guidelines are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3883)|
| 1:04:47| In the past, we've approved things such as medical hardships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| Well, I challenge you in this thick book to find where there's such a thing as a medical hardship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| for a reason for allowing someone to put a trailer next door to a house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| But if you will fly in to our airport and you look down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3901)|

| 1:05:10| Now, was that a nice thing to do? Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| Was it a nice gesture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| But it violates the ordinances that we established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3916)|
| 1:05:20| The Board of Zoning Appeals is a quasi-judicial body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| Our job is not to write law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3924)|
| 1:05:26| It's to enforce the laws you write.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3926)|
| 1:05:29| We need your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3929)|
| 1:05:31| My suggestion is we have two that come up every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3931)|
| 1:05:36| One is swimming pools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3936)|
| 1:05:38| And based upon my understanding and some of the others as well as the law director's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3938)|
| 1:05:42| basically building into the setback, the peripheral setback, is basically not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3942)|
| 1:05:51| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| Now, some will disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3952)|
| 1:05:54| Some will agree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| And there again lies the confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3956)|
| 1:06:01| Mr. Dales, you have one minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3961)|
| 1:06:03| Corner lots and swimming pools are something that's created the greatest deal of upheaval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3963)|
| 1:06:10| We are currently working on wording to change these ordinances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| or write new ones that we're going to be presenting before you and ask you to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3976)|
| 1:06:19| The second thing I would ask is that the commission ask MPC, BZA, and the codes office to rewrite a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3979)|
| 1:06:28| go back through this and find the ones that are totally antiquated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3988)|
| 1:06:31| and rewrite these and present them to you all for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3991)|
| 1:06:35| Our community deserves, we've grown, obviously 30 to 50 years worth of regulation that's outdated needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=3995)|
| 1:06:43| updated to meet our growing needs of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| Thank you all for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4006)|
| 1:06:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4007)|
| 1:06:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4009)|
| 1:06:52| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| Thank you, Mr. Daniels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| I appreciate you bringing that to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4015)|
| 1:06:57| And, Mr. Schoonmaker, thank you for your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| A question to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| Several of us were in a meeting that we talked about some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| Is Daniel in the process of doing some renovation on some of these codes right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4024)|
| 1:07:11| Do we need to put that in the form of a resolution for next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| bring that up as a resolution next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4033)|
| 1:07:15| Or is that going to be enough time for Daniel to do all this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| Well, commissioners, thank you, Commissioner Smith, members of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4038)|
| 1:07:23| When I first took over as law director, one of the first things we did was try to look at some of these codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4043)|
| 1:07:28| That's why you've been hearing complaints about people coming forward saying, gee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| it's always been this way, why are you changing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| What we've been trying to do is have greater scrutiny and more consistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| About a month ago, I discussed this with the chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4057)|
| 1:07:40| and he asked me to put together a workshop for this very subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4060)|
| 1:07:45| Working with MPC, working with the BZA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4065)|
| 1:07:47| trying to update and codify these rules and make them more consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| So we have been doing this because I spent years as a land use and planning attorney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| so I've had enough experience drafting these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| But this has been in the works for about a month now, and I appreciate Mr. Daniel's emphasizing that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| but we're moving forward on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4083)|
| 1:08:05| I just met with MPC last week to go over parts of the code, and likewise, my office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4085)|
| 1:08:11| one of my attorneys, Daniel Sanders, is working with me to look at the BZA as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4091)|
| 1:08:15| William, when you all do get that approved, just come let us know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4095)|
| 1:08:19| and I appreciate you leading the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| You've been a really good chairman for that group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4101)|
| 1:08:23| Appreciate your service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4103)|
| 1:08:26| Mr. Young.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4106)|
| 1:08:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4109)|
| 1:08:30| I promised that I would make this short, so I'll make it as short as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4110)|
| 1:08:34| I need your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4114)|
| 1:08:36| Oh, the address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4116)|
| 1:08:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4117)|
| 1:08:39| I'm Stanley Young, 1717 Broadway, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4119)|
| 1:08:44| and I also reside in Oak Ridge, 206 Elmhurst, Oak Ridge, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4124)|
| 1:08:53| I am here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4133)|
| 1:08:54| I've given out the accusations, and I have provided to all the commissioners some of the evidence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4134)|
| 1:09:03| I just want to make sure everyone's aware of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4143)|
| 1:09:06| and my primary purpose today is to get on your next calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| I've spoken with Amy Broyles about it and virtually every commissioner here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4150)|
| 1:09:16| Congratulations, Vice Chair Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| I don't think I talked to everyone over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| It seems like a minor matter to get on the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| This has been called serious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| I'm not going to go through the case right now, and some have called it worse than Watergate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4168)|
| 1:09:34| I think the commission needs to know what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| I want to make it perfectly clear we are asserting no allegations against the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4178)|
| 1:09:44| and the mayor's office as well as the commissioners have been open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4184)|
| 1:09:50| and seriously interested in this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4190)|
| 1:09:54| Indeed, Dean Rice and the mayor's office have reached out to us offering to try to get to the bottom of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4194)|
| 1:10:03| I'm not going to go into any details, but a former commissioner here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4203)|
| 1:10:08| I don't know if I should give him credit for a good quote because I may not get it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4208)|
| 1:10:14| said that it takes a combination of things to run a good government, especially a county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4214)|
| 1:10:20| It takes an active citizenry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4220)|
| 1:10:23| It takes advocates, activists, lobbyists, newspapers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4223)|
| 1:10:30| and the combination because you have huge calendars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| You can't know everything unless someone brings it to your attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4233)|
| 1:10:38| We're bringing this to your attention as a newspaper to participate in government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| I have it in writing, and all I'm asking right now, I'm going to end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| I could go on for a while, is that someone, Commissioner Boyles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4249)|
| 1:10:55| or Tony Norman just put us on the calendar and that we will take 10 or 15 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4255)|
| 1:11:02| We won the contract, we being the Knoxville Journal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| I think when you look at the evidence, Joe Tourette initially disqualified the Metropulse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| because it was not a newspaper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4272)|
| 1:11:14| So I think when you look at it, it's like in the Olympics if they're on steroids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4274)|
| 1:11:21| and there's a second place when you disqualify someone, it goes to the second place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| We won it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4286)|
| 1:11:28| So can we get it put on the calendar, anyone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4288)|
| 1:11:35| My thing, I'm not sure exactly about putting it on the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4295)|
| 1:11:41| I think I would like to hear Joe's opinion on do we need to put together a group of a few of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4301)|
| 1:11:49| to sit down and go over this, or how do we need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4309)|
| 1:11:54| how should this be handled, a complaint of this nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4314)|
| 1:12:03| Well, I would like a public airing, and if we solve something before then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4323)|
| 1:12:08| it seems like a simple request, I mean, we will participate in that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4328)|
| 1:12:12| and I think that's a good suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4332)|
| 1:12:14| Let me go ahead and I'll probably eliminate some of the discussion here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4334)|
| 1:12:20| This is an issue that goes between the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4340)|
| 1:12:23| This is a civil issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4343)|
| 1:12:24| The commission has nothing that they can give you any power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4344)|
| 1:12:27| And so you'll have to go before the law director, have a meeting with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4347)|
| 1:12:32| and the mayor's office, discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4352)|
| 1:12:34| If you can't come to a resolution, if I'm not mistaken, I believe you'll have to sue the county for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| You know, what we're saying is all we need is the approval of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4358)|
| 1:12:43| You approved the contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4363)|
| 1:12:45| We want it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4365)|
| 1:12:46| The issue of approval has not come before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4366)|
| 1:12:49| We have spoken with the mayor's office, and they believe this is the proper procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| All I'm asking you to do is approve or disapprove a contract that we believe we won.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4373)|
| 1:13:00| Okay, okay, Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4380)|
| 1:13:02| So I made that clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4382)|
| 1:13:04| Dr. Briggs, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4384)|
| 1:13:06| How much was the contract for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4386)|
| 1:13:08| We don't really know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4388)|
| 1:13:10| The annual budget that you gave was $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4390)|
| 1:13:14| It was for a daily contract, which we're not questioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| Sentinel should have won that, and they just called it advertising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| And for a weekly contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| Let me, I don't mean to stop you, but it depends on how much we're dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4405)|
| 1:13:29| If there's a contract according to the county charter section 3.02 paragraph M,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4409)|
| 1:13:36| and I think it may have changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4416)|
| 1:13:38| This is an old copy of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| It used to be if it was $50,000, it had to come to the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4420)|
| 1:13:45| Is that being increased on contracts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4425)|
| 1:13:47| It's $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4427)|
| 1:13:48| It's $100,000, and this contract could be that much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| It was that much, $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| How much of it we get, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4433)|
| 1:13:55| It should be before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| We cite that same rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| Well, then what would happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4440)|
| 1:14:01| That contract, I don't think, should have ever been put out to bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4441)|
| 1:14:05| It was put out to bid, and we won it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4445)|
| 1:14:07| And now we're asking for your approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4447)|
| 1:14:10| Well, no, what I'm saying is if this contract was for over $100,000, we don't approve a contract after it's sent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4450)|
| 1:14:16| We approve a contract, or we have to approve these contracts before anything is made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4456)|
| 1:14:21| But we only do contracts over $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4461)|
| 1:14:24| That's exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4464)|
| 1:14:25| You approved, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| Unless we know how much the contract is, it depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4467)|
| 1:14:30| Because if it's under $100,000, it doesn't come before the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4470)|
| 1:14:33| Well, I can't say that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4473)|
| 1:14:35| The approval was $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| They didn't break it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| The contracts for advertising was $125,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4481)|
| 1:14:46| It comes within the jurisdiction of this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4486)|
| 1:14:51| And I think it should at least be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4491)|
| 1:14:54| Dr. Briggs, do you have anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4494)|
| 1:14:55| The only thing I would say is that if it is a contract like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4495)|
| 1:14:58| I think the mayor's office is the one that has to bring it before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4498)|
| 1:15:01| Yes, they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4501)|
| 1:15:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| We have talked to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4503)|
| 1:15:04| They seem receptive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4504)|
| 1:15:05| I don't want to take up any more of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| Commissioner Briggs, do you have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4508)|
| 1:15:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4509)|
| 1:15:10| And the journal as a business is located within the second district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| which is one of the reasons that I've taken an interest in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4515)|
| 1:15:19| And I think the way that this has to happen is that the contract has to be put on the agenda for the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4519)|
| 1:15:28| to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4528)|
| 1:15:29| We can't just do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4529)|
| 1:15:31| That's what I'm here to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| What I'm saying is that I'm not comfortable putting this on the agenda right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4533)|
| 1:15:38| until, like I said, we have an opportunity to sit down with the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4538)|
| 1:15:42| and with the other parties and discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4542)|
| 1:15:46| And then if at that point it needs to be added to the agenda by the mayor's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| or the purchasing department or whoever needs to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| then they need to take the steps to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4553)|
| 1:15:55| That's not something that I can do or that any of the commissioners can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4555)|
| 1:15:59| But I can certainly help get a meeting set up and get this resolved as quickly as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4559)|
| 1:16:07| So I will get together with you after this meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| and also with Mayor Burchett and with the purchasing department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| and we'll set up a meeting for as soon as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| and we'll get this straightened out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4576)|
| 1:16:18| And if it needs to come back before commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| then that will go through the appropriate channels to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| And, of course, we'll have Joe Jarrett there, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4587)|
| 1:16:28| We don't do anything without Joe's approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4588)|
| 1:16:31| I just wanted to bring the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4591)|
| 1:16:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4593)|
| 1:16:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4594)|
| 1:16:35| Mr. Mott has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4595)|
| 1:16:37| I have a question, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4597)|
| 1:16:38| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4598)|
| 1:16:39| I know we've tossed around the $125,000 figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| That must be the line item that's in the current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| That's my understanding, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| What was your bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4607)|
| 1:16:49| What was your bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| It was a dollar per line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| They had a form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| We filled it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4615)|
| 1:16:56| It's a dollar per line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| It was bill bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| If you look at the invitation for bid, which is in this package,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| we filled out the proper forms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| It was a dollar per line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4627)|
| 1:17:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| Vic Spencer, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4632)|
| 1:17:28| I'm Vic Spencer, 11012 Flotilla Drive, Maxwell, Tennessee, 37974.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4648)|
| 1:17:37| I'm sorry, but I had a laptop failure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4657)|
| 1:17:40| I was going to present here a PowerPoint presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4660)|
| 1:17:46| so I will have to do it from the printed version, and so do challenges go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4666)|
| 1:17:52| We all have them from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4672)|
| 1:17:56| I'm a 70-year-old guy who is struggling with his weight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4676)|
| 1:18:02| and I have noticed something two years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4682)|
| 1:18:05| I have spoken in front of you, some of you who were here then,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4685)|
| 1:18:10| and I noticed something that can destroy this country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4690)|
| 1:18:19| and I am dedicated to it until I will go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| but I think that this enemy is within us that we must do something about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4704)|
| 1:18:31| We are becoming the best uneducated country in the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4711)|
| 1:18:36| That's the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| In 2010, Tennessee dropped to the 48th position in the ACTs in the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4719)|
| 1:18:51| but the more dangerous issue is that we as a country back in 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4731)|
| 1:18:59| dropped to 34th in mathematics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4739)|
| 1:19:02| and I found out during the past month that we dropped to 48th in the world| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4742)|
| 1:19:10| in both science and mathematics on high school output.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4750)|
| 1:19:15| The ramifications of this are incredibly bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4755)|
| 1:19:21| Now, what could be the cause of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4761)|
| 1:19:24| I don't want to go into a lot of details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4764)|
| 1:19:26| but there are some management issues that I think that education districts have to pay attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4766)|
| 1:19:33| One is the size of central management organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4773)|
| 1:19:39| The American Association of School Administrators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4779)|
| 1:19:44| have mentioned 1% as an average for central administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4784)|
| 1:19:49| and 2.4% in headcount for the Office of the Principals and Assistant Principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4789)|
| 1:19:57| We are higher than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| Central administrations, if anyone has ran a private company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4800)|
| 1:20:06| or a large enough P&L center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4806)|
| 1:20:10| they are a fertile ground for kingdom-building, good old boy networks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4810)|
| 1:20:15| who are friends but not necessarily competent in the field that they are to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4815)|
| 1:20:21| The results are telling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4821)|
| 1:20:22| You can look at the results, and they always protect their own turf.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4822)|
| 1:20:27| I found a chart in the Sentinel's January 31 business section this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4827)|
| 1:20:34| which lists about the surrounding district a bunch of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4834)|
| 1:20:38| so I just took two things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4838)|
| 1:20:40| and that is the ratio of administrators to teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4840)|
| 1:20:46| And Weenox County, we are running at 8.7% in that ratio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4846)|
| 1:20:51| where somebody like Maryville is running at 5.3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4851)|
| 1:20:56| Okay, too bad I cannot show the chart because it's very pretty, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4856)|
| 1:21:01| But it's very meaningful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4861)|
| 1:21:05| So this is one thing I think that needs some attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| The other thing is that if you don't have competition in anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4869)|
| 1:21:15| you will not have quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| Competition is what makes good products and good output.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4878)|
| 1:21:24| Without competition, it's not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| We spend $9,500 per student per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4887)|
| 1:21:29| including principal and interest also per student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4889)|
| 1:21:33| which is not the highest in the U.S.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| but it's sure as heck a lot higher than what the number one country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4895)|
| 1:21:42| in the chain of 48 that I mentioned to you is spending, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| And their cost of living is not higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| Our private schools outperform and some greatly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4909)|
| 1:21:55| outperform greatly the public schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| and some of them are doing it for less money than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4918)|
| 1:22:03| KCS performance may or may not get sufficiently better, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| History, you always look at when you're trying to forecast something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4927)|
| 1:22:11| But I would like them to win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4931)|
| 1:22:13| I would really, I wouldn't be standing up here if we were not in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| Mr. Spencer, you have one minute, please, if you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4938)|
| 1:22:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| Objectives are the third thing that one ought to pay attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4943)|
| 1:22:28| If you cannot measure objectives, how can you plan to achieve them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4948)|
| 1:22:34| How can you budget to achieve them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| You cannot, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4956)|
| 1:22:38| I know that from my business experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| and everybody who has run any activity should know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4961)|
| 1:22:46| Objectives like increased student achievement doesn't mean much, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4966)|
| 1:22:52| I mean, how do you know you achieved that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| Or even the slogan for the five-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| building on strength, excellence for all children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| What does that mean, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4982)|
| 1:23:05| So I'm asking you all, including KCS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| to pay attention to these basic factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| Size of headquarters operations are to serve the line function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4991)|
| 1:23:15| The output, that's what needs to be made better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4995)|
| 1:23:18| And in planning, clear objectives that you can measure are essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=4998)|
| 1:23:25| And also, competition is the most important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5005)|
| 1:23:29| And I thank you very much for giving me this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5009)|
| 1:23:31| Sorry about the hiccup with the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5011)|
| 1:23:36| We have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5016)|
| 1:23:37| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5017)|
| 1:23:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| Thank you, Mr. Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| I'm up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5022)|
| 1:23:43| Hi there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5023)|
| 1:23:46| And thank you for your work and the fact that you did send this PowerPoint to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5026)|
| 1:23:52| I don't know how many of the commissioners got a chance to look at it beforehand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5032)|
| 1:23:56| but I did and I thought several of those positions you brought up were significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5036)|
| 1:24:04| When you talk about, well, the two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5044)|
| 1:24:08| there's two that really affect me as a former teacher here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5048)|
| 1:24:14| And one is a recurring theme that we took up in some detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5054)|
| 1:24:20| during the budget process, and that was the size of central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5060)|
| 1:24:25| Now, there's misinformation that goes out about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5065)|
| 1:24:31| There's a misuse of a report that the school system did eight years ago or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5071)|
| 1:24:40| which was essentially an opinion survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5080)|
| 1:24:45| But it's a very significant issue, I think, to us for many reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5085)|
| 1:24:51| both from a budgetary standpoint and just from a pure educational standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5091)|
| 1:25:01| So you're touching on some things, especially when you talk about size of central office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5101)|
| 1:25:09| that are very important to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5109)|
| 1:25:12| And so I think that that's a continuing place for us to look and to question and to challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5112)|
| 1:25:24| So I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5124)|
| 1:25:27| The other significant thing that I'd like for you to elaborate possibly a little bit more on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5127)|
| 1:25:34| if you would, is just the clarity of goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5134)|
| 1:25:40| I see that $190, $90, $90 thing, and it just, I can't, I don't get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5140)|
| 1:25:51| Now, when we talk about ACT, that's a very clear measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5151)|
| 1:25:57| So could you talk about, just for a minute or just for a little bit about some of the lack of clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5157)|
| 1:26:07| that I think and a lot of people think that we have in terms of educational measures?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5167)|
| 1:26:17| I look at myself in this county as an ant in the sand, sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5177)|
| 1:26:26| And you're asking a very important question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| I think that when you look at the objectives of any organization, if the objective is not measurable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5189)|
| 1:26:40| in other words, if it cannot be expressed in numbers, then you have great difficulty to do two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5200)|
| 1:26:47| One is after the period of performance, which is generally a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5207)|
| 1:26:54| it becomes very difficult to tell if you achieved something and to what extent you achieved that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5214)|
| 1:26:59| Both of these questions are very important in business as well as any other activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5219)|
| 1:27:06| Second, I think that myself looking at the objectives of the Board of Education itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5226)|
| 1:27:18| that's in the policy manuals, doesn't have a single thing that's measurable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5238)|
| 1:27:23| And to me, that would be a major challenge because then the question arises,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5243)|
| 1:27:31| how do you budget for something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| Well, what functions have to be there and what each one of them needs to perform,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5254)|
| 1:27:39| like achieving the ACT, which is a nice end of pipeline measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5259)|
| 1:27:45| So I don't want to criticize too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5265)|
| 1:27:52| I mean, I don't know what kind of challenges they have internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5272)|
| 1:27:59| I could only guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| But I know what these kind of operating details mean, not only in business, but in any operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5282)|
| 1:28:11| So another thing that's very important with goals is for them to be clear to the average person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5291)|
| 1:28:20| Something like 190-90-90 is a very complex formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5300)|
| 1:28:27| I found many people within Central, in fact, who could not explain it to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5307)|
| 1:28:34| But the ACT is relegated to the last term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5314)|
| 1:28:37| And in a cascading computation, when you compute the percentage of the previous goal to achieve at the next one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5317)|
| 1:28:46| and you do this four times, you can end up with things that are not very meaningful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5326)|
| 1:28:53| And statistically, they can be spewed all over the place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5333)|
| 1:28:56| So goals, simple goals like, OK, next year we shall achieve an ACT of 22, just as an example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5336)|
| 1:29:10| And then a plan put together that identifies what is required, what actions need to be done by whom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5350)|
| 1:29:18| and what actions need to be done by each school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| and how much that's going to involve in manpower and money and programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5362)|
| 1:29:28| That's something you could measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| And you could measure by component so that you would know which component fails and when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5370)|
| 1:29:36| OK. Thank you, Mr. Spencer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| I know there's more lights on, so these are certainly issues that we'll continue with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5379)|
| 1:29:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5385)|
| 1:29:46| Thanks. Thank you very much for your opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5386)|
| 1:29:49| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| First, I'd like to say for my own, just for me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5390)|
| 1:29:55| it's nice to connect maybe a face with the rather large e-mails that I receive related to the state of education in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5395)|
| 1:30:11| And I appreciate you being here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5411)|
| 1:30:13| taking a lot of time of yours to take a little bit of our time to address what you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5413)|
| 1:30:20| as major concerns in education in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| The thing that I guess you have to realize from us is that the relationship of Knox County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5424)|
| 1:30:32| and the Board of Education is quite complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5432)|
| 1:30:36| We have a significant play in how the Board of Education operates into its funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5436)|
| 1:30:45| And that's about the end of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5445)|
| 1:30:47| I think you might find us standing with you or talking with you about how does education improve in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5447)|
| 1:30:56| but the Board of Education is fine elected folk just like we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5456)|
| 1:31:03| Their expertise, though, is in education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| And the information that you're bringing and sharing with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| I don't know what it may be designed to sway us with or to or from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5471)|
| 1:31:18| but really what you're bringing us is something that the Board of Education has to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5478)|
| 1:31:25| And not saying anything in the slightest way, we're not receiving your information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5485)|
| 1:31:34| It's just that I don't know what we have to do with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5494)|
| 1:31:36| or how we can affect it or put it into effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5496)|
| 1:31:41| or how we can affect how the Board of Education operates education in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5501)|
| 1:31:48| I think they're doing a good job of where they're at with what they've got to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5508)|
| 1:31:54| I think incrementally they're improving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5514)|
| 1:31:58| Everything is incremental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5518)|
| 1:32:00| There is no end of this journey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5520)|
| 1:32:03| I just want to emphasize the fact that the things that you share with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5523)|
| 1:32:08| I want to make sure you're sharing it with those people that are elected to affect education in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5528)|
| 1:32:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5535)|
| 1:32:16| May I answer you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5538)|
| 1:32:20| Commissioner Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| I have participated in board meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| and I have shared my information with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5546)|
| 1:32:30| and I asked questions, many of which were answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| and some key questions that were not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| I'm not here to change anything on the local scene.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5558)|
| 1:32:48| I cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| I think, though, that we all could stand up for our country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5570)|
| 1:32:57| I came here as an immigrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| I became a citizen and I took shots for this country twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5579)|
| 1:33:04| I would do it any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| I love this place and I see it going down the tubes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5586)|
| 1:33:10| and surely all of you can see the same thing with all the imports and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5590)|
| 1:33:15| So, you know, improvement has to start in the smallest operating unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5595)|
| 1:33:19| which is a school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| I don't know how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5601)|
| 1:33:23| I don't get a response from the Board of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| but I appreciate very much you giving me the time to present this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom101025part1?start=5606)|
