| 0:03:13| Mr. Law Director, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=193)|
| 0:03:15| You said it would take a two-thirds vote to add that to the agenda since it was within 90 days of the last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=195)|

| 0:03:35| If the sponsor wishes to keep it on or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=215)|

| 0:03:48| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=228)|
| 0:03:49| So it'll take a two-thirds vote to buy our Commission rules to put it on well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=229)|
| 0:03:53| We can do it without objection. Do we have anyone? What's the number we're talking of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=233)|

| 0:04:04| Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=244)|

| 0:04:26| Number three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=266)|
| 0:04:28| And that refrains from performing a duty that is imposed by law or that is clearly inherent in the nature of the public servants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=268)|
| 0:04:36| office or employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=276)|
| 0:04:38| To go against that is a Class C felony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=278)|
| 0:04:43| When we talked about these appointments in January, I believe the law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=283)|
| 0:04:51| 30 days was a reasonable time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=291)|

| 0:05:01| If anybody would like to see this law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=301)|
| 0:05:04| I'll be glad to pass you a copy around. I believe this is a relatively new law. Isn't it? Mr. Law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=304)|
| 0:05:12| You're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=312)|
| 0:05:14| I'm sorry, you're talking about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=314)|
| 0:05:17| Law that was added last July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=317)|
| 0:05:19| For investigations. Is that what you're looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=324)|
| 0:05:27| Don't know that that would pertain to this item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=327)|
| 0:05:30| Commissioner you don't think it would be a misconduct not to do our job then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=330)|
| 0:05:36| As we've discussed before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=336)|
| 0:05:39| You know, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=339)|
| 0:05:44| Sufficient case law that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| That doesn't place a time limit on making appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| We've talked about a number of times we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| Having the appointments in December that would have been fine talked about having the appointments in January. That would have been fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=356)|
| 0:06:03| Right now the way it's set the appointments are to be made on February the 20th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=363)|
| 0:06:10| Since that item was discussed what we're what we're talking about right now is adding the item to the agenda since that item was was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=370)|
| 0:06:18| Discussed and passed on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| By our rules by the Commission's rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=381)|
| 0:06:24| Which can be suspended with a two-thirds vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=384)|
| 0:06:27| But by our rules it cannot the matter cannot arise again for 90 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=387)|
| 0:06:34| Cannot come up again for 90 days before this body. You can suspend your rules with a two-thirds vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=394)|
| 0:06:40| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=400)|
| 0:06:41| You can also amend the agenda with a two-thirds vote. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=401)|
| 0:06:45| Understand that but I just want these commissioners know what they were voting against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=405)|
| 0:06:50| Mr. Chairman, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| Would just add that there is a relevant section of Tennessee code annotated 5 5 1 17| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=412)|
| 0:06:58| This is notwithstanding the provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=418)|
| 0:07:00| 5 5 1 15 the county legislative body a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| Majority of his members consenting may adjourn the election to a subsequent day of the term and that's exactly what we did in our previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=424)|
| 0:07:11| vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=431)|
| 0:07:13| Commissioner Hammond, yes, mr. Chairman. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=433)|
| 0:07:15| I would argue that we are doing our duty that we have set a date for appointments that date is February 20th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=435)|
| 0:07:22| and I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=442)|
| 0:07:24| We did vote on that. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=444)|
| 0:07:27| To say that perhaps we are a guilty of misconduct that we are guilty of a possible felony for not doing our jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=447)|
| 0:07:33| I would argue that we did do our jobs that the date has been set| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=453)|
| 0:07:36| We're ready to go February the 20th for the appointments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=456)|
| 0:07:39| Matter of fact, I was going to ask that we add to the agenda a discussion of possible forums after February 5th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=459)|
| 0:07:45| we're 30 days away from early voting and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| So it just seems to me that it boils down to do we want the voters to have a say in this or do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=469)|
| 0:07:54| We not and we have voted that we do and I think that's a positive thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=474)|
| 0:07:57| And so I'm not concerned about any possible ramifications of violating this because I believe that last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=477)|
| 0:08:04| We did take a positive action. We have set the date. The appointment date is February 20th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=484)|
| 0:08:09| Thank You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=491)|
| 0:08:13| Ivan Harmon, I just want to move something up. Well, hang on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=493)|

| 0:08:30| Mr. Chairman, let's I want to clarify it will take eight votes to even get it on the agenda. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=510)|
| 0:08:36| But to put out of 916 on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| And what's the yes and no mean on this one we're just adding to the yes would be to add to the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=522)|
| 0:08:47| No would be nothing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=527)|

| 0:10:01| Ordinance that establishes registration and licensing requirements for sexually oriented businesses in Knox County and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=601)|
| 0:10:10| That's a result of an action by this Commission that was taken in 2005 that approved of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=610)|
| 0:10:17| Certain ordinance we're going to have a little news conference tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| That deals with it with more specificity, but this afternoon we learned that the federal judge has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=622)|
| 0:10:29| Granted Knox County's motion for summary judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| so we now have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=633)|
| 0:10:36| An ordinance that will be enforced we had withheld enforcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=636)|

| 0:10:49| At the request of federal court we withheld enforcement, but starting tomorrow morning we will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=649)|

| 0:10:58| So it was a very good news. Hey, mr. Chairman a couple of items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| I would like to ask that we might possibly add an agenda first. We had talked about this new time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=661)|
| 0:11:07| We were going to go through two months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| November and December and then we're going to evaluate it to see if we wanted to continue on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| So, I guess my question is do we as a body want to go ahead and keep the same time frame for January| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=674)|
| 0:11:20| Or do we want to revisit it this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=680)|
| 0:11:22| Do we want to take another look at it another time because we had said two months and the two months is up tonight. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=682)|
| 0:11:30| Is that part of the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=690)|
| 0:11:35| So, let me add that to the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=695)|
| 0:11:38| How would I do that? Mr. Law director to or do we want to do we want to just keep the same time frame for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=698)|

| 0:11:44| Do why don't we send it to the rules? Okay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=704)|
| 0:11:49| Rules come in and then the other thing is I'd like to add to the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| I have a plan for the forums for after February 5th. I'd like to add that to the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=712)|
| 0:11:59| before discussion purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=719)|
| 0:12:02| Okay, or would you like to add it to public form or we do it next month? I mean, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=722)|

| 0:13:03| these types of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=783)|
| 0:13:06| Investigations and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| Complaints would better be served in the criminal justice system. And we certainly have that ability in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=788)|
| 0:13:18| That's available to us and so I'd like to recommend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| That both those two items be withdrawn and I know that'll take which items are you talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| So it's number 909 and 919| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| And then I've got one other change after we deal with those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=812)|
| 0:13:41| Commissioner Norman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=821)|
| 0:13:44| 909 I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| Well, I believe that deals with the subpoena power that we already granted ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| Mr. Law Director, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| That is correct because it's September 2000. It's the September meeting where we had already approved that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=834)|
| 0:13:59| So, I don't know that withdrawing that does really think then that we're not going to be able to discuss it tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| I mean, we've got a long agenda and if we want to discuss it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=845)|
| 0:14:09| in January or something, I guess we could or we keep it on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=849)|
| 0:14:15| 919 has to deal with the Tyler Harbor, which we've not really taken any action on yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| We just heard about that. We just heard about that back in committee. So well, it was just my impression that we that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=861)|
| 0:14:29| Discommission would better serve be served by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=869)|

| 0:14:35| interested in both of these topics that feel like this is a criminal issue and I think I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=875)|
| 0:14:42| Paul considers it a criminal issue and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=882)|
| 0:14:45| Mr. Lambert considers this criminal issue on federal level and that both of those would be better served there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=885)|
| 0:14:52| but but again, that's that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| That's subject to the view of the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=895)|
| 0:14:58| Well, I guess my question about 909 is that I guess mr. Law director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=898)|
| 0:15:06| To do I guess what Commissioner Norman is asking. I guess we'd have to take a motion to do away with our subpoena powers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=906)|
| 0:15:14| Is that what you're asking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=914)|

| 0:34:53| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2096)|
| 0:34:57| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2097)|
| 0:34:58| Dr. Stewart was here earlier, and he had asked me to relay his thoughts on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| There's certainly nothing against Mr. Deakins in terms of his serving on the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| But he asked me to relay to you that there is concern among members of the Ethics Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2107)|
| 0:35:13| about elected officials being on the body, myself included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| And so they are asking that there be a workshop or perhaps some discussion with County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| about the future of the Ethics Committee, about some of the thoughts that they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| about the makeup of the Ethics Committee and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2129)|
| 0:35:32| So I told him that I would present that to you today and for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2132)|
| 0:35:38| Basically, he was asking that we defer this for 30 days, that we have a workshop so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2138)|
| 0:35:44| the Ethics Committee can come and just talk about some of the ideas that they have on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| the makeup of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| That's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2152)|
| 0:35:53| I'll make that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| We delay it for 30 days, but also set a date for a workshop today, if we can, to meet with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2155)|
| 0:35:59| the Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| Could we not just do that through our committees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2160)|
| 0:36:05| We could if we want to set the date as our next committee meeting and set aside time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2168)|
| 0:36:09| We could, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2169)|
| 0:36:10| Well, I think that's a good date because since we're still meeting all at one time, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| you get everybody at one time instead of having to come down again just for something like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| So we'll set the meeting date as, I mean, that would be the motion, that there be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| workshop in conjunction with our next committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| I'll withdraw my motion in favor of that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2188)|
| 0:36:30| So it's back to Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2190)|
| 0:36:32| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2194)|
| 0:36:35| Improperly seconded by Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2195)|
| 0:36:38| Did you have a conversation with, I think the last time you were going to have a conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2198)|
| 0:36:42| with the school board or the Ethics Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| Did you all have some conversation with them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2204)|
| 0:36:46| No, we had asked that the school board meet with Ms. Waller to talk about any possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| And Ms. Waller, from what I gather from Mr. Stewart, that hasn't happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| There has not been that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| That's another reason why they were saying it would be good maybe to have a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| So I told them I would bring that up here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2219)|
| 0:37:03| What we currently have is a nine-member Ethics Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| And if you were to approve of this resolution tonight, you would in effect be adding a member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2226)|
| 0:37:11| to the committee to serve through the end of August, August 31 of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| If that would be the intent of this body, we would need to make sure that we had also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2237)|
| 0:37:24| properly amended the ethics policy of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| And this is certainly one of those situations where it would be beneficial to have a discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2259)|

| 0:44:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2645)|
| 0:44:06| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2646)|

| 0:44:17| And as I stated on Friday, I would abstain from voting on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2657)|

| 0:44:55| Took no action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2695)|
| 0:44:56| Lack of a quorum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2696)|

| 0:45:00| No recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| Can I get a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| I'll make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2706)|
| 0:45:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2707)|
| 0:45:09| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2709)|
| 0:45:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| I would like to put some kind of amendment in there to protect the taxpayers of not only Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2712)|
| 0:45:22| and the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2722)|
| 0:45:26| We got into this in South Knoxville over there, and the gentleman asked for it to be annexed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2726)|
| 0:45:33| When the city annexes in a situation like this, we lose 28 cents of our tax revenue in the sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2733)|
| 0:45:44| When we lose that tax, we have to raise property tax to get the people the services they want in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2744)|
| 0:45:54| and, therefore, we even raise it on the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| So this is to protect the city people and the county people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2756)|
| 0:46:02| I would like to amend this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| If it's ever annexed inside the city limits, that our TIF be paid off immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2765)|
| 0:46:13| In other words, whatever is built there, then they go on the regular tax roll at the time that it's annexed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2773)|
| 0:46:20| Also, I would like to recommend that we hold this on the 15 years instead of setting a precedence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2780)|
| 0:46:28| for 20 and 17 years like the IDB Board recommends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2788)|
| 0:46:33| And that's just two things I'd like to amend it to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| I'll second it to get it on the floor for discussion or for them to come forward and make their case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2796)|
| 0:46:44| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2804)|
| 0:46:48| Commissioner Painter, you said you wanted to put it on 15 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2808)|
| 0:46:52| Fifteen years and to amend it if the city annexes it at any time, our TIF is to be paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| Yes, I do not have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| Mr. Seymour, you want to let him speak and I'll speak just right after he does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2820)|
| 0:47:04| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2824)|
| 0:47:05| Mr. Chairman, members of the commission, I'm Arthur Seymour, Jr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2825)|
| 0:47:08| I'm here on behalf of Graham Corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| As you know, this is a preliminary resolution that would send this matter to the Industrial Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2831)|
| 0:47:17| to consider the economic ramifications of the Willow Creek Shopping Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2837)|
| 0:47:22| and whether a TIF would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2842)|
| 0:47:27| The two motions, one that if this property is annexed into the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2847)|
| 0:47:35| TIF will be paid off by Mr. Graham immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| That is satisfactory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2858)|
| 0:47:40| The 15-year limitation, that is satisfactory with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2860)|
| 0:47:47| As you know, what you're doing is sort of putting parameters around what the Industrial Development Board can consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2867)|
| 0:47:57| The process is, if you all recommend this positively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2877)|
| 0:48:02| it will go to the Industrial Development Board to consider the economic impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| and whether or not a TIF is appropriate, and that will be within the parameters you all set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2887)|
| 0:48:13| You all are setting the outer parameters if you approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2893)|
| 0:48:18| The Industrial Development Board will then consider the matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2898)|
| 0:48:21| and then if approved there it will come back to you all for final action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2901)|
| 0:48:27| But I want to reiterate that those limitations that you have stated, Commissioner Pinkston, are fine with the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2907)|
| 0:48:35| And we certainly agree to those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2915)|
| 0:48:41| Did you all want us to proceed at this time with our presentation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2921)|
| 0:48:45| Well, that said, I think we should vote on Commissioner Pinkston's amendment to what's before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2925)|
| 0:48:51| and make clear that we're just voting on that amendment and then return to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2931)|
| 0:48:57| And if Commissioner Pinkston's amendment is passed, then it's the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| I've got a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2941)|
| 0:49:02| I want to add to that, if Mr. Pinkston will allow, that the TIF is lower the TIF down to $5.5 million instead of the $6.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2942)|
| 0:49:15| Lower it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2955)|
| 0:49:16| Because I like the amendments that you had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2956)|
| 0:49:17| Those make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2957)|
| 0:49:22| Does someone else want to speak on the amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2962)|
| 0:49:29| Well, I have a question about the amount of the TIF, because what's in the packet says $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2969)|
| 0:49:37| I don't see where it says $6 million unless there's something else been added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2977)|
| 0:49:44| So it makes a big difference how much the TIF is going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| As to whether or not I want to even send it on to the Industrial Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2990)|
| 0:49:56| Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2996)|
| 0:49:59| We would like we these are preliminary cost estimates that are being refined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=2999)|
| 0:50:05| and will continue to be refined until we go to the Industrial Development Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3005)|
| 0:50:12| The original application had $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| Further cost, and this started several months ago, our projection of cost now exceeds $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| If you all pass Mr. Smith's amendment, that puts a $5.5 million ceiling on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3021)|
| 0:50:31| That is satisfactory with Mr. Graham, is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3031)|
| 0:50:40| Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3040)|
| 0:50:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3043)|
| 0:50:45| How long will it take, you believe, to amortize the TIF if you're doing $5.5 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3045)|
| 0:50:54| What's your projection?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3054)|
| 0:50:56| In your previous packs that we submitted when we applied for the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3056)|
| 0:51:02| when we submitted the original application and also in what we just handed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| you'll find some amortization schedules that amortize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3066)|
| 0:51:10| It's in the left side of your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3070)|
| 0:51:13| This sheet right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3073)|
| 0:51:16| It is a $6 million, a $5.5 million, a $5 million, and a $4 million amortization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3076)|
| 0:51:21| Based on our projections on the incremental property tax, the $6 million takes 17 years to amortize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3081)|
| 0:51:33| The $5.5 million takes 15 years, and that's why we're agreeable to the 15 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| or the $5.5 million because it pays itself out in 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| The $5 million pays out in 14 years, and the $4 million pays out in 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3102)|
| 0:51:51| And let me say, too, that these projections are very conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| A 3% growth rate, which takes into account basically zero development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3115)|
| 0:52:01| on a lot of undeveloped property around this proposed development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3121)|
| 0:52:06| So I can see very, you know, I think with some development around the property over the next 10 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3126)|
| 0:52:15| that, you know, we'll have a strong payoff of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3135)|
| 0:52:23| Mr. Graham, I understand you're going to need to do some infrastructure improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3143)|
| 0:52:32| Other developers pay for those out of their own funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| Why is this case different?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| Well, if you'll permit me, I'll share a couple of the --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| Let's start with the site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| You've got a colored site plan on the right side of your packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3173)|
| 0:53:01| One, let me say, too, that Hulls is a great community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3181)|
| 0:53:05| We're tickled to be finally, after five years, have a project that we can develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3185)|
| 0:53:14| We look forward to being a part of this community for many years like we have in other parts of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3194)|
| 0:53:21| This is a 60-acre, approximately 60 acres when you take in all the road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3201)|
| 0:53:27| and the stream relocation project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3207)|
| 0:53:32| Mr. Chairman, I'm sorry to interrupt, but, Mr. Vice Chairman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3212)|
| 0:53:34| aren't we now straying into the merits of the overall proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3214)|
| 0:53:37| and straying away from Commissioner Pinkston's amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3217)|
| 0:53:41| And shouldn't we deal with that first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| That's fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| I can save these questions for later, but they're questions I'm going to have to have before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| I can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| They're very meritorious questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3231)|
| 0:53:53| I just want to get the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3233)|
| 0:53:54| Well, it may impact how I want to vote, even on the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| Really?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3237)|
| 0:53:58| Okay, then proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3238)|
| 0:53:59| Forgive me for interrupting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3239)|
| 0:54:00| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| Go ahead, Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3242)|
| 0:54:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3244)|
| 0:54:05| Mr. Graham, if you'll proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3245)|
| 0:54:06| We were simply trying to address Mr. Leuthold's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3246)|
| 0:54:11| Three or four of the key things on this project is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3251)|
| 0:54:15| if you will look in your second set of documents that I've just produced the last day or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3255)|
| 0:54:23| this shows the existing greenway and halls around the library| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3263)|
| 0:54:28| and shows our proposed greenway with the stream relocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| Behind that sheet, and this is getting more to your question there, Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3272)|
| 0:54:40| shows the, we call this the halls water bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| that shows the parallel of the two streams that run parallel with Highway 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3285)|
| 0:54:52| As you can see, it's very challenging to find certainly even a 20-acre site, much less a 60-acre site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3292)|
| 0:55:01| that you can develop big box and multi-tenant retail on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3301)|
| 0:55:07| In fact, it's so difficult that the new Walmart located up Norse Freeway bought residential property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3307)|
| 0:55:14| rezoned it commercial with some challenge there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| and they're not even on the main road of halls, which is Highway 33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3319)|
| 0:55:24| They actually turned our site down six or eight years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| because obviously their property is cheaper developed, less expensive land, not on the main highway, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3329)|
| 0:55:36| When you look at the other available property, this is really the first site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| and we're a mile north of other retail centers from Emory Road approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3341)|
| 0:55:48| This is really the only site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3348)|
| 0:55:51| We've spent five years showing this to Lowe's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| and this is the only site that we could put together that offers any kind of chance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| of having a multi-tenant shopping center in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| Now, Halls has had a new center since the late 80s, 1990,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| when Walmart went in originally with Ingalls and Goodies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| With the growth of Knox County and certainly the growth of this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3374)|
| 0:56:18| it's a tremendously growing community, great housing, great household income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3378)|
| 0:56:24| You know, as we all say, Halls has it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3384)|
| 0:56:27| and the only thing they don't have is a strong multi-tenant center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3387)|
| 0:56:31| that there's a lot of retailers west, northwest on Clinton Highway, east at the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3391)|
| 0:56:37| Hopefully we're going to get some of these south at our South Grove,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3397)|
| 0:56:40| and certainly Halls is capable of serving or handling these other retailers, junior anchors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3400)|
| 0:56:48| And this is literally the only site that within two or three, four miles, I guess you could go to Union County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3408)|
| 0:56:56| but I think we desire to keep our retail in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| And the challenge of this site is the stream has to be relocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3420)|
| 0:57:05| The other exhibit I want to bring your attention to, I call it my ABC site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3425)|
| 0:57:14| This exhibit here, it's on the right side of your packet, shows the development as proposed, site plan A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3434)|
| 0:57:24| And these exhibits we had to present to TDAC, Tennessee Department for Stream Relocation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3444)|
| 0:57:31| to demonstrate the difficulty of this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3451)|
| 0:57:33| The second, plan B, shows the shopping center pulled forward and staying out of the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3453)|
| 0:57:41| And, therefore, when you do that, because of the slopes, the detention, those things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3461)|
| 0:57:46| your parking ends up across Maynardville Highway with not any outlots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3466)|
| 0:57:51| And then the third one that she is showing you shows the same center without parcels on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3471)|
| 0:57:57| Everybody knows you have to have out parcels for a project to be even closely viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3477)|
| 0:58:02| So I'm simply demonstrating that the stream, if the stream doesn't get relocated, then the project's not viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3482)|
| 0:58:11| And we do have our permits from all the necessary agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3491)|
| 0:58:16| And I do have a couple people here that would just take, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3496)|
| 0:58:24| I understand about the stream would have to be relocated in order to place the buildings where you would like the buildings to be placed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3504)|
| 0:58:34| What does your plan, how does that benefit Knox County as far as the infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3514)|
| 0:58:42| What are we getting for our money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| Things you're receiving are Quarry Road is a major or a side road that is going to have major improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3525)|
| 0:58:56| And Bob Bowers with Wilbur Smith is here to speak on that along with our connector road and the Highway 33 improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3536)|
| 0:59:04| In addition to this stream and the things that Roy Arthur with Knox County Engineering will speak to if you would permit him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3544)|
| 0:59:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| Well, if they'd like to speak to, you know, I mean, does it improve traffic flow in the area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3553)|
| 0:59:19| I mean, I'm not as familiar with Paul's as Commissioner Moore and Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| So, you know, if it's, this is something that is needed and beneficial to that community, that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3564)|
| 0:59:33| If it's simply so that you can, it needs to be done just because you need it done in order to do a development, that's something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3573)|
| 0:59:41| If you'll indulge me, may I take just a couple minutes and let them speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3585)|
| 0:59:46| First will be Liz Porter with S&ME.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| Yes, we've been, my name is Liz Porter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3592)|
| 0:59:54| I'm with S&ME and we've been working with Mr. Graham on the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3594)|
| 0:59:57| As far as what Knox County gets from the stream improvements, we're working to relocate the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| It is currently impaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| It has cattle in the stream and it has no riparian buffer zone on it, which means that water quality is impacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3605)|
| 1:00:11| In relocating the stream, you will increase the stream length, you will improve the habitat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| and you will put back that canopy of trees on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3617)|
| 1:00:20| We will also be creating a greenway adjacent to the stream, which will be a benefit to the community as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3620)|
| 1:00:26| So that would be something that the community could go down by the creek or there would be a path, a walkway or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3626)|
| 1:00:33| And is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| It's a half mile of greenway, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| A half mile of greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| Uh-huh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3640)|
| 1:00:41| And maybe Commissioner Smith or someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3641)|
| 1:00:43| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3643)|
| 1:00:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3644)|
| 1:00:45| Is there a tendency for that stream to flood when we do get rain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| I mean, is it something that we're trying to prevent, a flooding problem, possibly by improving and moving that stream?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3651)|
| 1:00:58| What you've got now, you've got a pasture and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| And she's exactly right, and she hadn't got to this yet, but they're going to put some trees in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| It's going to help filter the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| They're going to greatly enhance the stream and the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3666)|
| 1:01:11| A half mile is a long way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| So we're improving the water quality by moving it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| And Arthur's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3678)|
| 1:01:19| He's with the Beaver Creek Watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3679)|
| 1:01:22| They're for James McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| I believe James McMillan was for that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| I won't speak for him, but I'm pretty sure James is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| If you could continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3691)|
| 1:01:32| James maybe won't speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3693)|
| 1:01:34| I'll just keep this brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| But, yes, we would be improving water quality and putting the trees back adjacent to the greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| so it will be a much better setting than is currently on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3700)|
| 1:01:46| Thank you, Liz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3706)|

| 1:01:53| Roy Arthur, 7911 Leverett Way in Powell, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3713)|
| 1:01:58| Don't have much to add to what Liz said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3718)|
| 1:02:01| except to say that a year and a half ago Mr. Graham came to a group from the Beaver Creek Task Force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3721)|
| 1:02:07| that has been working for the past ten years to improve water quality in Beaver Creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| and asked if we thought that this was a viable solution to his problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3732)|
| 1:02:20| This was a stretch of stream that at some point in the past had been straightened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3740)|
| 1:02:28| which is not a natural function of a stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3748)|
| 1:02:32| As Liz said, had no buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| And relocating the stream we look at as a restoration project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3755)|
| 1:02:41| We thought it was a good project and we recommended that if he needed to relocate this stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3761)|
| 1:02:51| that we would be for it because we thought it would be beneficial to water quality in Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3771)|
| 1:02:59| So this is a stream that flows into Beaver Creek?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3779)|
| 1:03:01| It's a stream that flows into Beaver Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3781)|
| 1:03:03| It actually flows into Beaver Creek right behind the Halls Library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| And is this a source of pollution due to some of the cattle that's, I guess, in this general area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3787)|
| 1:03:17| that's polluting not only this stream but downstream and Beaver Creek and beyond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3797)|
| 1:03:23| Yes, in terms of pathogens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3803)|
| 1:03:27| I think the primary benefit from the relocation will be to aquatic habitat, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| And I'm not here to speak in favor of or against this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| just to tell you that the Beaver Creek Task Force has examined the stream relocation project and we approve of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3819)|
| 1:03:49| And Commissioner Lutho, it's something when Roy's for a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3829)|
| 1:03:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| If I may, Bob Bowers with Wilbur Smith will speak on your traffic and road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3834)|
| 1:03:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3839)|
| 1:04:06| Commissioner, I think there are also some benefits to Knox County generally with respect to roadway improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3846)|
| 1:04:15| I'm sorry, my name is Bob Bowers with Wilbur Smith Associates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3855)|
| 1:04:18| We've done traffic engineering work associated with the project as well as other work for Knox County and the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3858)|
| 1:04:25| I think there are some elements of this that can be beneficial to the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3865)|
| 1:04:32| one of which is Quarry Road itself, which is the eastern boundary of the project site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3872)|
| 1:04:38| is relatively substandard in many respects, especially the width at the bridge crossing at Williford Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3878)|
| 1:04:48| Significant improvements to that roadway are planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3888)|
| 1:04:51| The two ends of that, one on Emery Road and one on the Mainerville Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3891)|
| 1:04:56| both have difficulties in the peak periods, which could be helped with turn lanes on Mainerville Highway and on Emery Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3896)|
| 1:05:05| left turn lanes to shield the left turning traffic out of the through traffic way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3905)|
| 1:05:12| Neither of those are really expected to be done in the near term at least without probably this process taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3912)|
| 1:05:24| Mainerville Highway itself had a relatively high priority with the TPO and with the Department of Transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3924)|
| 1:05:30| I think even got a safety loop earmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| Unfortunately, the cutbacks from the federal government to TDOT and flowing on down have just shoved this project as well as many others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3934)|
| 1:05:44| as we read in the paper further and further into the future so that if we can make some improvements to Mainerville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3944)|
| 1:05:51| with respect to adding left turn lanes and the like that would be well in advance years wise ahead of what TDOT might do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3951)|
| 1:05:59| then that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| So part of the improvements won't just be to Quarry Road but also to Mainerville Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3960)|
| 1:06:04| Is that part of what the TIF will help pay for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3964)|
| 1:06:07| That's correct, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3967)|
| 1:06:11| The intersection of Mainerville Highway and Emery Road is what I guess I would call the number one corner in halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3971)|
| 1:06:18| It sort of sets the tone for the rest of the traffic signal system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| We are working with Knox County now on a broader range of improvements associated with that area of Norris Freeway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3982)|
| 1:06:30| Emery, and Mainerville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| And Knox County has asked that there be some at least minor improvements made on the short term with this project at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=3992)|
| 1:06:41| Mainerville-Emery intersection to help with the capacity there a little bit and we would expect to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4001)|
| 1:06:47| Finally, there is a new connector road proposed as a part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| The distance from the Emery Road intersection with Mainerville to Quarry is about a mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4011)|
| 1:06:57| And of course there's a lot of commercial businesses and a couple of schools in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4017)|
| 1:07:04| If the connector road were in place and if either it or Quarry were signalized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4024)|
| 1:07:11| it could very well provide some additional flexibility in traffic flow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4031)|
| 1:07:16| reduce some of the stress on the Mainerville intersection and allow folks to circulate to some of those commercial areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4036)|
| 1:07:22| and to the schools from the Brown Gap area and the Emery Road area without having to go through that major intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4042)|
| 1:07:29| So I think in sum total there are several elements of this that provide value to the public at large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4049)|
| 1:07:36| Bruce Weichert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4056)|
| 1:07:49| Commissioner, I know I'm taking a long time, but we're talking about a lot of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4069)|
| 1:07:52| and I want to make sure that we're getting our money's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4072)|
| 1:07:58| Bruce, have you seen the proposal of road changes and the stream and what they're talking about doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4078)|
| 1:08:07| Yes, I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4087)|
| 1:08:08| And the improvements that they're talking about, do you see them as needed improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4088)|
| 1:08:16| improvements that we would ever get to if we weren't doing this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4096)|
| 1:08:21| I don't see them as improvements that we would ever get to without doing this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4101)|
| 1:08:26| And the reason I say that is other parts of the county, because of growth and in dealing with road problems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| it's not a matter of getting on a list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| As you have the growth and so forth, I've got more pressing areas in the counties that we would direct our attention to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| So without the TIF and so forth, I doubt these improvements would be done in 10 or 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4119)|
| 1:08:46| Do you think there are improvements that need to be done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4126)|
| 1:08:49| Today as it stands with the traffic volumes and traffic counts out there, I cannot say that they need to be done today, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4129)|
| 1:08:55| But if they were going to put a shopping center there, then they would need to be done, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4135)|
| 1:09:00| Unquestionably, with the shopping center, yes, these improvements very much need to be done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4140)|
| 1:09:04| not withstanding the creek relocation and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| but definitely the road improvements would need to be done for the load.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| There's no question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4149)|
| 1:09:10| And have you taken a look at the creek relocation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| I personally have not looked at creek location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| I do know it's gone through public hearing, it's gone through TDEX approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| it's gone through the Army Corps of Engineers approval as far as the relocation itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| but I believe they've all approved the relocation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| Is there anybody in your department that has looked at it, maybe it's Chris,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4166)|
| 1:09:30| and taken a look to see if it's a needed improvement or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4170)|
| 1:09:34| Leo Cameron in my office more than likely would have looked at the improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| And I guess you'd have to define the word needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| I think to do the relocation partly is to obviously build the loads and to some extent to build the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4180)|
| 1:09:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4187)|
| 1:09:49| Mr. Graham?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4189)|
| 1:09:53| We've talked about the greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4193)|
| 1:09:55| Is that something that is going to be either deeded back to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4195)|
| 1:10:00| or some type of easement granted to Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| something that we know will always be there for the citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4204)|
| 1:10:09| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4209)|
| 1:10:11| I was looking back because Legacy Parks, what is that that was just formed recently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4211)|
| 1:10:17| Who was I talking to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4217)|
| 1:10:20| I think would be the perfect candidate to take that as a deed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4220)|
| 1:10:24| but we're more than willing to grant an easement, deed, whatever, on the stream and greenway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4224)|
| 1:10:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| Mayor, I mean, I guess you're in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4233)|
| 1:10:44| How would you like to see the greenway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4244)|
| 1:10:49| Commissioner, I think there are a variety of ways we could deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4249)|
| 1:10:51| I think probably the best way would be to give it to the Legacy Park Foundation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4251)|
| 1:10:55| and at some point in time maybe turn it over to Knox County Parks and Recreation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| but I think that would be the two steps we'd probably want to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| And you're in favor of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4261)|
| 1:11:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4262)|
| 1:11:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4264)|
| 1:11:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4265)|
| 1:11:07| Do we have any more questions on Commissioner Pinkston's amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| I want to talk to Arthur there just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| Now, Arthur, on this annexation deal, if it's taxpayers protected now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4274)|
| 1:11:20| if Tim sells that, we still want it to be paid off no matter who owns it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4280)|
| 1:11:26| He's on the note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4286)|
| 1:11:31| He's fine with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| Can you clarify that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| That's a good question, Paul, why he's on that annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| You're doing all those outposts or these buildings out there, what, 13 or 14, 15, how many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4298)|
| 1:11:45| Let's say one of them is annexed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| So that's what you're saying, Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| One of them is annexed and he pays the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4309)|
| 1:11:51| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4311)|
| 1:11:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4312)|
| 1:11:53| And you're fine with that, Tim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4313)|
| 1:11:54| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4314)|
| 1:11:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| And no matter whether Tim owns the property, if he sells it, it still stays that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| It goes with the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4320)|
| 1:12:09| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4329)|
| 1:12:10| I would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4330)|
| 1:12:11| Mr. Smith brought up my name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4331)|
| 1:12:15| He was a little bit incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| I am not for this project and for several other reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| We've got segmented here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| First off, we have a stream right there that can be some improvements put on it where it is at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4344)|
| 1:12:31| that Mother Nature has created right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| There's been streams, water running down this little valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4354)|
| 1:12:38| We're talking about moving the stream several hundred feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4358)|
| 1:12:42| We're putting it in new substrates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4362)|
| 1:12:44| We're creating something that Mother Nature created before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4364)|
| 1:12:48| Yes, it may have been straightened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4368)|
| 1:12:50| It may have been straightened out in earlier work on sewer lines and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4370)|
| 1:12:56| But it is far cheaper to work on streams, to improve them that are already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4376)|
| 1:13:04| There is canopy there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4384)|
| 1:13:05| Canopy starts with grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4385)|
| 1:13:07| Not all of our streams everywhere have forest over them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| There is repairing zones there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4392)|
| 1:13:14| There is grass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4394)|
| 1:13:15| There's vegetation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4395)|
| 1:13:16| There's hydric soil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4396)|
| 1:13:17| There's wetland soils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| There's everything that would take thousands of years to create.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| And this can be enhanced where it's at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| Mr. Graham could have leaved the stream alone, redesigned his development, used the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4408)|
| 1:13:40| made his plan fit the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| I love Lowe's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4423)|
| 1:13:45| I buy all my lumber there when I am doing something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4425)|
| 1:13:49| But we're talking about 40 more outbuildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| Do we need that many?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| Yeah, if we put that many, I guess we would be parking across Manor Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| Two, this here lately, the audit, everybody's checking on every dime of county money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4439)|
| 1:14:08| how it is spent in the best way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| We have blighted areas, even open boxes in halls that people will be driving by to go to more big boxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4451)|
| 1:14:21| And TIFs are usually used in blighted areas where we're trying to put income back in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4461)|
| 1:14:29| This is not a blighted area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4469)|
| 1:14:32| Four to $6 million would go a long ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| We've got school children that have been killed here lately that can't even get into schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4477)|
| 1:14:43| We have infrastructure problems everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4483)|
| 1:14:47| $6 million would go and do a lot of good in other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4487)|
| 1:14:52| This is setting a bad precedence, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4492)|
| 1:14:56| Mr. Graham bought this land or has an option on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4496)|
| 1:14:59| He knows the limitations of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4499)|
| 1:15:01| He knew the stream was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4501)|
| 1:15:04| And I like Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4504)|
| 1:15:08| We get along good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4508)|
| 1:15:10| And that's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4510)|
| 1:15:12| But this is the same old thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| This is not low-impact development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| He can put a greenway right beside of the stream that's there now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| Should the citizens have to spend $4 to $6 million to get a greenway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| I don't think that is a good, wise investment for the citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4527)|
| 1:15:34| Something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| I know one commissioner bowed out tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4535)|
| 1:15:40| I know a lot of commissioners here that are looking at me now have taken money from Mr. Graham| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4540)|
| 1:15:46| and are running for other political offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4546)|
| 1:15:50| In this sense now that we're all talking about how the perception of everything looks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4550)|
| 1:15:59| that's one thing to take some money for a campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4559)|
| 1:16:01| Now he's in front of you asking you to give him taxpayers' money for his own project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4561)|
| 1:16:09| that he could avoid all of this, do it without a tiff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4569)|
| 1:16:14| Sandra Clark had a wonderful thing today in the shopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4574)|
| 1:16:20| The trough is open now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4580)|
| 1:16:22| This will set bad precedents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4582)|
| 1:16:24| How many more developers will come in here now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| Oh, God, new most wonderful thing I'm going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4587)|
| 1:16:32| I need a tiff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| Economic development is supposed to be paid in infrastructure from the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4594)|
| 1:16:39| We have serious problems, schools and everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| Is this the most wise use of taxpayers' money when they drive by open boxes that are even on Mr. Graham's property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4602)|
| 1:16:52| He's got property all over Knox County and other districts that are sitting open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4612)|
| 1:17:00| Tax dollars going out of these districts into another district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4620)|
| 1:17:07| Again, I hope you reconsider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| I like Mr. Graham.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| I wished he would consider redesigning his plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| He's got plenty of room there for a Lowe's and several outbuildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4635)|
| 1:17:20| That would take the expense out of moving the stream, develop with the land he's got, do low-impact development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4640)|
| 1:17:28| I'll sit down, but I'm very much against this, and especially citizens' tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4648)|
| 1:17:36| With the problems we have in Knox County now, the scrutiny we've got over every lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4656)|
| 1:17:45| I know it's the holiday season, but this is a little bit ridiculous to give a $6 million tip at Christmas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4665)|
| 1:17:59| If I may, let's just talk about the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| In your left side of your packet, estimated benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4682)|
| 1:18:09| Number one, the projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4689)|
| 1:18:11| I would challenge you to, and you've also got a list of public-private projects the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4691)|
| 1:18:19| I would challenge you to find a 50-, 60-acre tract that did not have some sort of public-private partnership investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4699)|
| 1:18:30| That's been a buzzword in our industry for the last 10 to 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4710)|
| 1:18:34| Public-private projects just don't happen without participation and investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4714)|
| 1:18:41| Just in your list of projects, you can start with Turkey Creek 12 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4721)|
| 1:18:47| and run through what was a $6 million road in today's dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4727)|
| 1:18:53| I doubt you could get that road built for less than $12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4733)|
| 1:18:58| But the benefits are $12 million a year in retail sales and property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4738)|
| 1:19:05| That's a pretty good return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| And you can go on down the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| Knox County connected or extended shot in Callahan Road from Pleasant Ridge through in front of the Home Depot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4749)|
| 1:19:17| and through and beside the Target Lowe's out to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4757)|
| 1:19:24| I was talking to Mr. Weitrick today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| That was about $9 million that the county invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| Well, the retail sales and property tax are nearly $7 million in one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4771)|
| 1:19:38| You just don't get a return like that in any kind of investment vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4778)|
| 1:19:45| So, and you can go on down through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| I think, and let me just say, all of these are progressive projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4787)|
| 1:19:53| Keeping the new Sentinel in the central city, that was a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4793)|
| 1:20:00| South Grove is going to be a good project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| You drive out there, the roads, the traffic lights, it fixed a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| and it provides a good retail sales tax and property tax return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4806)|
| 1:20:12| North Shore Town Center was just approved a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| The new Sentinel Tower downtown and then, of course, our Willow Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4815)|
| 1:20:21| But just in summary, we project sales tax annually every year over $2 million from this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4821)|
| 1:20:30| That doesn't go in the TIF application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4830)|
| 1:20:32| And I think that being located in the far northeast quadrant of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4832)|
| 1:20:41| you're going to pull even more of the Union County, Granger County, Anderson County people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| that live near the county line into this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4846)|
| 1:20:54| And then the list of the rest of the benefits, obviously, is the property tax, half a million dollars a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4854)|
| 1:21:00| So 2.7 in benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| It's not the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4862)|
| 1:21:04| If the project doesn't happen, it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| The project doesn't get built, it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4867)|
| 1:21:09| So the benefits far outweigh the investment and the other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4869)|
| 1:21:19| This isn't out of hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4879)|
| 1:21:20| This is a project every couple, three years that are 50, 60, 100-acre projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4880)|
| 1:21:27| And you just don't plot or find or put together and have all the infrastructure, all the utilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4887)|
| 1:21:33| all the roads to make a project like this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4893)|
| 1:21:42| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4902)|
| 1:21:45| I'd like for Mike Hammond to speak to the issue of TIFs in this situation, if he's prepared to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4905)|
| 1:21:54| I mean, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4914)|
| 1:21:56| Mike Hammond is not ready to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| I'm looking at Mike Edwards because I know him really well, but I'm calling him Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4925)|
| 1:22:06| Tony, we have a problem calling him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4926)|
| 1:22:07| I don't know which one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4927)|
| 1:22:08| It's getting almost my bedtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4928)|
| 1:22:09| It's 830.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4929)|
| 1:22:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4932)|
| 1:22:13| Mike, you sure you don't want to do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4933)|
| 1:22:16| I'm Mike Edwards, Knox County Development Corp., 17 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4936)|
| 1:22:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| My purpose here is not to speak for or against this application or any that may precede it, succeed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4949)|
| 1:22:43| But I do want to kind of put some things in perspective because mostly for the public to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4963)|
| 1:22:52| About three years ago, the legislature gave industrial development boards the power to grant TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4972)|
| 1:23:00| Prior to that, TIFs were used for blighted areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4980)|
| 1:23:07| They were given to developers to reinvest in those blighted areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| and downtown is a good example of where you've seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| You've seen it recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=4997)|
| 1:23:20| I think KCDC still does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5000)|
| 1:23:22| Prior to that, IDBs dealt with jobs and recruitment of those jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5002)|
| 1:23:30| So in the form of pilots where we would request freezing someone a new tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5010)|
| 1:23:37| or expansions taxes for a period of time based on some objectivity of number of jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5017)|
| 1:23:46| the salaries, the payroll, the capital investment, and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5026)|
| 1:23:52| It is a lot easier, frankly, to do that than it is to do the KCDC or the TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5032)|
| 1:24:00| because TIF is more of a community development issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5040)|
| 1:24:04| Pilots are usually used for economic development, which would be the jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5044)|
| 1:24:10| When we got the power or the IDB got that authority, we spent about a year wrestling with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5050)|
| 1:24:18| trying to figure out how to for an IDB to make a judgment call on something that is as subjective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5058)|
| 1:24:29| as granting what could be incentives to developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5069)|
| 1:24:36| When we got to the point where we can't make this as simple as number of jobs, amount of wages, so on and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5076)|
| 1:24:45| it is very subjective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5085)|
| 1:24:47| It goes to very much public policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5087)|
| 1:24:51| And that's why we felt that we couldn't take on a, and I keep saying we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5091)|
| 1:24:59| the county industrial development board could not really adequately consider a TIF request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5099)|
| 1:25:09| absent of you all advising, the county commission advising it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5109)|
| 1:25:14| that you want it considered for a purpose that serves Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5114)|
| 1:25:22| A simple way to look at it, as what's been discussed here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5122)|
| 1:25:25| is if there is a badly needed infrastructure that you do not have built into your capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5125)|
| 1:25:33| or it's so far down in the capital plan and you want to raise it up quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5133)|
| 1:25:40| and the money's not available and you want to fast forward it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5140)|
| 1:25:43| you can do off-balance financing by building that infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5143)|
| 1:25:51| which is whether the developer needs it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5151)|
| 1:25:54| and TIFing that developer's property, whether he,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5154)|
| 1:25:57| because in that situation the developer doesn't really care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| Here's where you're heading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5162)|
| 1:26:04| You're making a decision that is basically saying in this instance you're going to deviate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5164)|
| 1:26:13| and in every instance such as this, and I can, as soon as I say this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| give you great examples of why you would do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5178)|
| 1:26:21| but you're making the decision to suspend your normal policy of having developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5181)|
| 1:26:31| do all the on- and off-site development expenses related to their development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5191)|
| 1:26:37| knowing that all of them probably benefit the county, all of them add value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5197)|
| 1:26:45| but it is the developer's responsibility if they want to do that development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5205)|
| 1:26:50| to do all the off-site and on-site expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5210)|
| 1:26:55| When you get into these, you're basically saying you're willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5215)|
| 1:27:01| and you desire to shift that burden off of the developer and onto yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5221)|
| 1:27:07| Now, Turkey Creek is a great example of where it wasn't a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5227)|
| 1:27:13| I think the city amended its capital plan and used appropriated dollars to build that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5233)|
| 1:27:20| and Knox County did something similar and so did Farragut, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5240)|
| 1:27:27| And then Turkey Creek came back years later and built a number of internal roads on their own nickel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5247)|
| 1:27:36| It is a very subjective decision that this board needs to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5256)|
| 1:27:47| The thing that I'm hoping I'm doing adequately is conveying to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5267)|
| 1:27:53| what the IDB is going to look at from your request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5273)|
| 1:28:00| and I think because there is going to be a number of these requests that are going to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5280)|
| 1:28:08| We've already heard from a number of retail developers, office developers, and housing developers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5288)|
| 1:28:16| all who have off-site improvements that they're going to have to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5296)|
| 1:28:19| Many have on-site improvements that they're going to have to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| and all can make a very sound justification for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5303)|
| 1:28:30| And there's nothing necessarily wrong with any of these requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5310)|
| 1:28:35| There's nothing wrong with this request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5315)|
| 1:28:38| I'm certainly not speaking against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| All I'm trying to say is you're not even setting a precedent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5320)|
| 1:28:48| You can decide which ones you want to do and which ones you don't want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5328)|
| 1:28:52| but you're going to get asked a number of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5332)|
| 1:28:55| And the IDB, which has to concur, and there's a reason under state law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5335)|
| 1:29:00| that they have this dual elected, non-elected bodies that sit there and judge these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5340)|
| 1:29:06| is, on their due diligence part, does it make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5346)|
| 1:29:14| This is a brand-new world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| This is not something that we're very used to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| I think that something in my big desire here today was to kind of put it in context| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5359)|
| 1:29:27| as to how I would advise you all to look in expectation of what's to come in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5367)|
| 1:29:38| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5378)|
| 1:29:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5382)|
| 1:29:43| As I look at this project and I look at this land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5383)|
| 1:29:48| I certainly see that a shopping center could be built there without moving the creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5388)|
| 1:29:55| But when I look at what sort of shopping center would be built there if they didn't move the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5395)|
| 1:30:01| it wouldn't be nearly as big of a shopping center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5401)|
| 1:30:05| It wouldn't have the big tenants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5405)|
| 1:30:08| and it wouldn't generate the sales tax dollars that this shopping center would generate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5408)|
| 1:30:14| And so when I look at that and then I ask myself, what would happen to the sales tax?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5414)|
| 1:30:24| You know, not just the sales tax dollars, the property tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| What would the value of this property be with a small shopping center?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| And I know a little bit about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| My family owns some small shopping centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| And the value is somewhat stagnant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5437)|
| 1:30:41| They don't tend to go up like the big shopping centers with the big box stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5441)|
| 1:30:47| And, in fact, if I compare my family's shopping center that happens to be located just across the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5447)|
| 1:30:54| from one of our lovely adult establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5454)|
| 1:30:59| and I look at what has this shopping center done over the last few years for Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5459)|
| 1:31:04| it's generated nominal amounts of sales tax income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5464)|
| 1:31:10| The value of the property has not significantly gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5470)|
| 1:31:15| And what's it done for my family?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5475)|
| 1:31:17| Well, we've had, we switch tenants a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5477)|
| 1:31:21| And my father and my uncle have made a retirement income off of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5481)|
| 1:31:26| Maybe it's employed a dozen folks over the last ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| When I look at Mr. Graham's shopping center up the street from our little shopping center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5490)|
| 1:31:36| hundreds of people working, sales tax dollars generated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5496)|
| 1:31:41| and not just Knox County sales tax dollars generated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5501)|
| 1:31:45| but folks coming from Anderson County, this shopping center being located on Clinton Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5505)|
| 1:31:51| Astronomical financial impact on this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5511)|
| 1:31:56| And also I've seen all the property values around Mr. Graham's center go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5516)|
| 1:32:04| So not only did the center increase in value and basically pay for itself with the TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5524)|
| 1:32:12| but it brought everything else in the area up, which increased the property tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5532)|
| 1:32:20| And that's not even counting the sales tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| That's why when I look at this project, I just keep thinking, what argument could there be against it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5543)|
| 1:32:30| Am I missing something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5550)|
| 1:32:32| Because the TIF dollars are dollars that aren't going to be generated without the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5552)|
| 1:32:38| The property values aren't going to go up without this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5558)|
| 1:32:42| The property values are going to remain somewhat stagnant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5562)|
| 1:32:46| Something will be built there for sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5566)|
| 1:32:48| but it's not going to generate the sales tax dollars that one of Mr. Graham's centers is going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5568)|
| 1:32:54| So when I look at it, it's like the dollars that fund this TIF are dollars that wouldn't exist if the project didn't happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5574)|
| 1:33:02| So the way I'm looking at it, and again, my logic may be wrong, I'm not the smartest man in the world,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5582)|
| 1:33:08| but it certainly looks like it doesn't cost us a dime to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5588)|
| 1:33:15| It doesn't cost us a dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5595)|
| 1:33:17| Every penny that's going to go into paying off this TIF loan is going to be generated by the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5597)|
| 1:33:24| And when I look at it like that, I can't see any reason why anyone would be against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5604)|
| 1:33:30| And that's why I'm voting for this tonight, and I wish someone would enlighten me if there's a reason not to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5610)|
| 1:33:36| But I just can't see that a single dollar is going to come out of a taxpayer's pocket to fund this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5616)|
| 1:33:43| because it looks to me like every dollar is going to be generated by the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5623)|
| 1:33:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| Commissioner Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5630)|
| 1:33:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5631)|
| 1:33:52| Mr. Graham, I've got two questions for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5632)|
| 1:33:56| When we just look at the project itself, the TIF is the project, but it also creates a zone, does it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5636)|
| 1:34:04| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| Around the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5645)|
| 1:34:06| Now, in this zone, all taxes are not suspended, it's just the area that you're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5646)|
| 1:34:12| In the zone, it's called the TIF zone or plan area, which will be maybe further refined when we go through the IDB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5652)|
| 1:34:21| and come back to you all for the final vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| But the --whenever we start the project would have a base year tax for all the properties in that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5663)|
| 1:34:33| And then, obviously, we feel that our project, as Mr. Lambert alluded to, will increase the values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5673)|
| 1:34:41| and it will stimulate development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| There will be people who want to build projects across the street or just up the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5684)|
| 1:34:48| and obviously those property taxes will go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5688)|
| 1:34:52| And in some of the literature that I've seen, that was around $463,000 versus $480-something thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5692)|
| 1:35:01| On the increment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5701)|
| 1:35:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5702)|
| 1:35:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| I think the first full year that the center is open, the base year is about $483,000 today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5705)|
| 1:35:12| And after the center is built, I think the first year we're projecting is $970,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5712)|
| 1:35:19| which will be about a $487,000 increment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5719)|
| 1:35:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5723)|
| 1:35:24| That can be applied towards the debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5724)|
| 1:35:26| Then on the sales tax, we're not looking at 15 years before we collect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| Once you start this project, at the end of the third year, we would probably receive part of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5731)|
| 1:35:37| if not all of the $2.25 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5737)|
| 1:35:41| Would that be right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| We very conservatively projected $200 a square foot for a half a million square feet of retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5744)|
| 1:35:50| And Walmart, their annual report every year, it's $400-something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5750)|
| 1:35:56| I think Lowe's one year was $300-something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5756)|
| 1:35:59| So Lowe's is probably at least, if they're not half, they're close to half of that sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5759)|
| 1:36:05| and certainly that starts right when they open the doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5765)|
| 1:36:08| So when you project that at the end of two years, is that the ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5768)|
| 1:36:12| When the center is built, yes, when it's completely built and all the businesses are open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| we're projecting $100 million in sales, which is about $2.2 on the local sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5776)|
| 1:36:22| Has most of your projections with most of your projects proved out to be pretty good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5782)|
| 1:36:26| or how do you come up with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5786)|
| 1:36:28| I think our best one is the Clinton Highway where Target, Lowe's, Hobby Lobby, Kroger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5788)|
| 1:36:34| are located across from Walmart and Home Depot, and that's probably the most typical project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5794)|
| 1:36:40| So that's probably the best one when you make a comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5800)|
| 1:36:45| We obviously are moving along in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5805)|
| 1:36:48| South Knoxville is not, you know, West Knoxville, Turkey Creek, but it's coming along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| and we're building, about to start some more buildings down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| So we expect that, and that's one thing that we see in the demographics in halls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5816)|
| 1:37:04| as being second to Farragut from a household income to the disposable income and those kind of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5824)|
| 1:37:12| and we think that some of the junior anchor tenants that are located in other parts of the county will want to come to halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5832)|
| 1:37:18| So if I understand this right, we don't wait for sales tax dollars for 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5838)|
| 1:37:23| Basically, if we loaned you $6,000, that's arbitrary at this time, or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5843)|
| 1:37:29| At the end of five years, basically, you've paid back, even though you're getting a tax increment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5849)|
| 1:37:37| Am I figuring this right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5857)|
| 1:37:39| I'm sort of lumpy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5859)|
| 1:37:40| No, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5860)|
| 1:37:41| The sales tax starts right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| It goes straight to the county checkbook, I guess, and the property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5862)|
| 1:37:49| Now, please remember, the base year, you still get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| The 483 that we've calculated as the base year in the TIF zone still comes to the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5873)|
| 1:38:00| and it's only the increment above that that, and let me say, too, that the first 10 or I believe it's 12%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5880)|
| 1:38:10| 33 cents only goes to the county then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| For those that may not understand a TIF, the difference that the taxes, the property taxes bring in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5894)|
| 1:38:25| because you start with a base tax, whatever the taxes are bringing in right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| Knox County will continue to get in a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5909)|
| 1:38:33| And outside of that, as it goes up, the portion of the tax that's the debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5913)|
| 1:38:43| which is 33 cents out of the 269, stays with the county because that's to pay off our debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5923)|
| 1:38:51| The rest of it would go to pay off the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5931)|
| 1:38:54| And I know that you've got your projections here of a 90%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5934)|
| 1:39:00| and I assume that you're sort of rounding off to that you would get 90% of it, but it's closer to only 88%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5940)|
| 1:39:09| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5949)|
| 1:39:10| So some of your numbers are actually a little bit not as conservative as you'd like them to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5950)|
| 1:39:18| It's the election year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5958)|
| 1:39:19| You're all probably going to reduce the property taxes this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5959)|
| 1:39:22| Well, we might increase the debt service part of the tax rate, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5962)|
| 1:39:28| But that's neither here nor there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| At the appropriate time, I'm going to, well, I'll just do it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| I'm going to see if we can put in the motion that it not be five and a half million, but only five million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5975)|
| 1:39:42| because, you know, I don't mind helping them out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5982)|
| 1:39:49| but when we start getting past that 10-, 11-, 12-year range, I do have a problem with TIFs going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=5989)|
| 1:40:00| The max he can get is a 15-year TIF, and the five and a half million, as I'm looking at it here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6000)|
| 1:40:11| it takes the full 15 years to pay it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6011)|
| 1:40:19| And that's if his projections were correct of what they'll get to pay off the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6019)|
| 1:40:28| Well, he's going to lose 2% because he estimated getting 90%, and he's only going to get 88% of the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6028)|
| 1:40:37| So in going down to five million, using his estimates puts him at 14 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6037)|
| 1:40:49| and with him not getting as much as he sort of projected, I see that bumping that back up to 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6049)|
| 1:41:07| You know, here again, 15 years is really a year or two longer than I like it to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6067)|
| 1:41:11| but I'd like to see if the maker of the motion would move that down to five million instead of five and a half million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6071)|
| 1:41:23| if that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| How about Mr. Graham?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6086)|
| 1:41:28| Well, certainly we're still we and I guess I accept our failure to completely present the six million from the get-go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6088)|
| 1:41:40| as we've learned about the new process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6100)|
| 1:41:43| And so, secondly, we I think when we submitted the TIF application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6103)|
| 1:41:50| we somewhat, you know, made a good guesstimate of the $4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6110)|
| 1:41:58| And so when we actually got detailed numbers on the road and those things, that's where we came up with the 6.7 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6118)|
| 1:42:08| But some of that 6.7 was land, and we're more than willing to dedicate the land and not throw it into the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6128)|
| 1:42:16| So, effectively, if you take it out, we're at 5.7, and you're suggesting five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6136)|
| 1:42:23| And I think we could make that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| And we have to personally guarantee the note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6146)|
| 1:42:31| Going back to your question, Commissioner Ballard, to make it simple,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6151)|
| 1:42:38| if the base year is $100 and the increments takes you to $200, then $88 goes to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6158)|
| 1:42:46| So we're conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| We're cautious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6168)|
| 1:42:49| We don't want to have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6169)|
| 1:42:50| We do have to, the first year or two, until everything gets built and open and assessed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6170)|
| 1:42:56| we generally have to supplement that payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6176)|
| 1:43:01| But still, yet, at the end of five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6181)|
| 1:43:04| Yeah, it will be up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6184)|
| 1:43:06| We will have generated enough sales tax that pays our investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6186)|
| 1:43:11| Yeah, I'd love for you to apply that towards the loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6191)|
| 1:43:14| From year five to year ten, then, is I don't know if you can say profit, but it's $60 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6194)|
| 1:43:24| But bottom line, $5 million in 15 years we can live with, with Mr. Pinkston's amendment there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6204)|
| 1:43:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6212)|

| 1:43:48| I guess I need to know if the maker and the second are willing to accept the five versus five and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6228)|
| 1:43:54| Commissioner Pinkston, you were the maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6234)|
| 1:43:56| Yeah, I did the 5.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6236)|
| 1:43:58| I'll amend that to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6238)|
| 1:43:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6239)|
| 1:44:00| We had the motion on the board to amend it to 15 years, the annexation part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6240)|
| 1:44:06| He put it in at 5.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6246)|
| 1:44:09| You've got it down to $5 million now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| I'm asking, yeah, if that's okay with the maker of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6251)|
| 1:44:13| He's withdrew his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6253)|
| 1:44:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6254)|
| 1:44:15| He's withdrew his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6255)|
| 1:44:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6256)|

| 1:45:53| My question is, why did he do so late in the game?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6353)|
| 1:45:57| Did he forget who his parents were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| Or did he forget where he lived?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6360)|
| 1:46:02| Why do I feel that this commission has already approved this project to set a precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6362)|

| 1:47:18| This country was built on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6438)|
| 1:47:20| If this man wants to do this project, let him do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6440)|
| 1:47:25| I would rather have a stream than another Lowe's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6445)|
| 1:47:29| I don't want to set a precedent for using this kind of program, which is a wonderful program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6449)|
| 1:47:36| Let's take it, put our heads together, and do something creative in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6456)|
| 1:47:42| And my final point is we are trying to rebuild a city here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6462)|
| 1:47:48| And when you do projects like this and encourage people to go out of town, on the roads, on strip malls, or box malls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6468)|
| 1:48:00| or whatever you want to call it, you're killing downtown, which the city of Knoxville is trying to build up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6480)|
| 1:48:08| I traveled a lot when I was working, and I've seen places like Omaha, Nebraska that are ghost towns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6488)|
| 1:48:15| because everybody moved out to the strip malls and left the inner city to the poor and the displaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6495)|
| 1:48:24| And finally, I had one more point, which I don't remember, but I appreciate your attention and thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6504)|
| 1:48:33| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to say one thing on this TIF here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6513)|
| 1:48:37| This is only the second TIF that we've ever given in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6517)|
| 1:48:41| And since I've been here, all the TIFs that we have given, with the exception of these two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6521)|
| 1:48:47| have been inside the corporate city limits and most of them downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6527)|
| 1:48:55| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6535)|
| 1:48:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Is Mike Edwards still here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6538)|
| 1:49:11| Mike, I want to make sure that I understand what the IDB will do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6551)|
| 1:49:16| What we're voting on is, as I read the caption, is to request the IDB to prepare an economic impact plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6556)|
| 1:49:24| Now, what will IDB do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6564)|
| 1:49:26| In other words, what will you be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| You will be taking information, if this passes, the 15-year, 5 million, the annexation plans part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6568)|
| 1:49:35| But when it comes to you, explain to me what IDB will do and then what you will return to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6575)|
| 1:49:41| The developer is required to submit to us a very detailed set of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6581)|
| 1:49:48| that outlines the entire development, the values of the entire nine yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6588)|
| 1:49:55| And we have to evaluate that and come to some sort of understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6595)|
| 1:50:05| Our big difficulty, the developer has to give it to us within 45 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6605)|
| 1:50:10| and then the board has to take it under consideration and get a sense of what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6610)|
| 1:50:19| Our problem is it's going to be a very subjective decision because it's going to yield a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6619)|
| 1:50:30| we're either going to agree or have some question about the cost estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6630)|
| 1:50:36| We're going to have some question about the rents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| We're going to have some question about the risk and rewards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6639)|
| 1:50:46| And the IDB is, you all have appointed them and they're very able people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6646)|
| 1:50:53| and they have a whole lot of expertise, including in development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6653)|
| 1:50:57| and they're going to evaluate the economic development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6657)|
| 1:51:00| and determine whether or not it is, if it makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6660)|
| 1:51:05| What I was trying to say here earlier is that the more that the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6665)|
| 1:51:11| because it's really the commission making the request, not the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6671)|
| 1:51:16| You all are needing to tell us or the IDB and give us guidance so that we can include that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6676)|
| 1:51:23| into the consideration of why the county wants to do this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6683)|
| 1:51:32| If you put it in the context of a TIF downtown, that would be done through KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6692)|
| 1:51:40| The council would ask KCDC to consider a TIF district for a blighted area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6700)|
| 1:51:47| It could be a skyscraper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6707)|
| 1:51:50| But it's in a – but KCDC then understands what its role is and what it's trying to accomplish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6710)|
| 1:52:00| Otherwise, why would you go build a skyscraper without –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| so they're needing some sort of direction, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6723)|
| 1:52:08| as to whether it's infrastructure you're wanting to assume the responsibility for, if it's the park piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6728)|
| 1:52:15| If you're really wanting to build a major –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| or participate in a retail development for community development purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6738)|
| 1:52:27| it helps the IDB to understand how to respond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6747)|
| 1:52:30| and evaluate the economic development plan that's going to be submitted by the developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6750)|
| 1:52:36| Otherwise, they're going to be right back where they were a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6756)|
| 1:52:42| when they were trying to evaluate these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6762)|
| 1:52:46| The county needs – the more you can give guidance on this thing, the board needs it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6766)|
| 1:52:55| What more do you need from us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6775)|
| 1:52:57| I mean, you've said that you need guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6777)|
| 1:52:59| Do you need us to determine the greenway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6779)|
| 1:53:01| Do you need us to determine the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6781)|
| 1:53:03| Do you need us to determine the retail aspect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| In other words, what do you think that the IDB needs from us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6785)|
| 1:53:10| I'm assuming that once you get all this information, you're going to be presenting us a report back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6790)|
| 1:53:14| and you're going to have – it's going to be detailed as to the information that you've just talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| and then we'll use that to make the final determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| But you said that you need guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6801)|
| 1:53:23| What further guidance do you think you need from us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| If the IDB has the discretion to accept, look at it, and decide to go forward or not go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6806)|
| 1:53:39| the more you can say why you want to shift this expense from the developer onto yourself for these pieces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6819)|
| 1:53:48| and the justification as to why the IDB is in a very good position to meet requests from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6828)|
| 1:54:00| It is very hard for it to meet a request from any developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6840)|
| 1:54:06| In fact, if you look at the city and how it would work with KCDC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6846)|
| 1:54:12| you're really responding to a request from city council on that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6852)|
| 1:54:20| John, you know a way to say this better than I'm saying it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6860)|
| 1:54:26| What the commission has done thus far is they've set some parameters, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6866)|
| 1:54:32| You would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6872)|
| 1:54:36| If it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6876)|
| 1:54:37| If it passes, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6877)|
| 1:54:39| If they had the plans before us, if they were to pass this tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6879)|
| 1:54:46| are the plans and the parameters not enough for the IDB to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6886)|
| 1:54:52| and prepare the economic impact plan or do you need something more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| It seems to me that we're pretty close to being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6896)|
| 1:55:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6901)|
| 1:55:03| If in passing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6903)|
| 1:55:06| The answer is on this one that the county wants to shift this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6906)|
| 1:55:12| and there's really just the general discussion that has occurred in here as to the reason why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6912)|
| 1:55:20| and they could go back and read the transcript and they sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6920)|
| 1:55:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6924)|
| 1:55:25| We can provide that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6925)|
| 1:55:26| That will be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6926)|
| 1:55:27| Let's take an absurd one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6927)|
| 1:55:29| A guy comes in and is being told he's going to have to add a red light| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6929)|
| 1:55:34| or a traffic light and a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6934)|
| 1:55:37| And he's standing here asking for a TIF to do that because in many of the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6937)|
| 1:55:44| it probably won't take two hours to discuss or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6944)|
| 1:55:48| but you all are going to have to come up with a similar response to this person up or down and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6948)|
| 1:55:55| And many, many, many times after that, it's going to be best to have the more you understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6955)|
| 1:56:05| that you can communicate why you're doing it, the easier it's going to be for this IDB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6965)|
| 1:56:10| and I think for you guys to figure out how you're going to sort through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6970)|
| 1:56:15| There are going to be a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| You had a number of questions that were asked by Commissioner Luthold tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| and they all got to, you know, what's the benefit here to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| And I think that was explained in a number of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| You also had several members of the public who explained how it wasn't a benefit to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| So those are things certainly to be weighed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6994)|
| 1:56:39| The vote on the county commission will communicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=6999)|
| 1:56:44| and then the backup will be the conversation that you had because the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7004)|
| 1:56:49| It would be great if the resolution was so specific it would say that because and because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7009)|
| 1:56:55| and because a very simple one it would have been if the road had been in the five-year capital plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7015)|
| 1:57:02| and it was clear that you needed to move it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7022)|
| 1:57:05| I mean, that one is something that they're going to be able to understand very clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7025)|
| 1:57:10| It doesn't mean that this they won't be able to understand this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7030)|
| 1:57:15| but they're going to take their job and have for a year fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7035)|
| 1:57:22| They're going to be very strenuous on how they deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7042)|
| 1:57:26| And the response that we heard from Bruce, I'm sure Bruce is still here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7046)|
| 1:57:29| but it sounded like what he was saying is if there's going to be a development that closely resembles this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7049)|
| 1:57:36| there's going to be a need for some road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7056)|
| 1:57:41| It's not on the list right now, but if there's going to be a development, it's sure going to be on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7061)|
| 1:57:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7066)|
| 1:57:47| That's I don't know why I got stuck doing this, but this is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7067)|
| 1:57:53| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7073)|
| 1:57:54| What they will suggest is that unless the problem pre-exists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7074)|
| 1:58:03| and the problem is occurring because of the development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7083)|
| 1:58:08| historically that has been the developer's responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7088)|
| 1:58:13| If they're creating a problem, it's their job to cure it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7093)|
| 1:58:16| You all are making, and there are good reasons to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7096)|
| 1:58:20| but you all are making a deviation from your policy in this respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7100)|
| 1:58:25| And this is going to come in the future, I think, in a number of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7105)|
| 1:58:31| and you have to make a decision of why this one is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7111)|
| 1:58:37| Would you like to have more detail then for the IDB as to why this is a qualifying project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7117)|
| 1:58:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7123)|
| 1:58:46| Well, the clearer you can make it, the easier they're going to be able to sort through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7126)|
| 1:58:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7133)|
| 1:58:55| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7135)|
| 1:58:56| I'll wrap up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7136)|
| 1:58:57| Let the other commissioners go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7137)|
| 1:59:00| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7141)|
| 1:59:03| Mr. Graham, would you address a couple of these things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7143)|
| 1:59:08| To me, it seems like Lowe's has quite a bit of financial capability to make this thing happen if they want to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7148)|
| 1:59:15| and as far as I can tell from what I've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7155)|
| 1:59:18| the infrastructure needs are created by you in terms of the road and the creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7158)|
| 1:59:25| and, therefore, I just don't quite understand why we should suspend our normal policy of expecting the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7165)|
| 1:59:34| to do all the off-site, on-site, like Mike says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7174)|
| 1:59:38| and so I just need you again to try to explain this to me, why we should change our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7178)|
| 1:59:45| I'm not sure the policy, I think maybe it is subjective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7185)|
| 1:59:51| and you look at the list of public-private projects, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7191)|
| 1:59:57| was it necessary to build a road through the 300 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7197)|
| 2:00:00| Look at the return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7200)|
| 2:00:03| Did it spur economic development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7203)|
| 2:00:05| Will this spur economic development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7205)|
| 2:00:06| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7206)|
| 2:00:08| The stream is impaired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7208)|
| 2:00:09| The stream has flood issues, riparian issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7209)|
| 2:00:14| It's an opportunity to, I mean, you're, as much as anyone on this board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7214)|
| 2:00:20| a water quality commissioner, and this will increase the water quality tremendously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7220)|
| 2:00:28| The greenway is a goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7228)|
| 2:00:30| It's progressive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7230)|
| 2:00:31| You know, you can be progressive or you can not be progressive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7231)|
| 2:00:34| but the greenway is a goal to connect the Willow Fork ball fields to the library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7234)|
| 2:00:39| Here's half a mile of it that is about half of the greenway that it will take to connect those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7239)|
| 2:00:46| Quarry Road has a tremendous vertical curve as it approaches Maynardville Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7246)|
| 2:00:53| and obviously an inadequate bridge down at the stream,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7253)|
| 2:00:56| so you're going to have substantial road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7256)|
| 2:00:59| And, of course, the fact that we have a half a mile of road frontage provides another connector road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7259)|
| 2:01:03| between Quarry and Emery Road that will leave traffic as East Emery is receiving as many building starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7263)|
| 2:01:12| and subdivisions as probably any area of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7272)|
| 2:01:15| So these are roads that will help the community, will benefit the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7275)|
| 2:01:21| And, again, I just say it's not like, you know, there are people standing in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7281)|
| 2:01:27| You just don't put together 50, 70, 100-acre properties, and even if you did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7287)|
| 2:01:33| you don't have the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7293)|
| 2:01:35| You don't have the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7295)|
| 2:01:37| You might not have the utilities to meet that need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7297)|
| 2:01:41| So I think these are great progressive projects that you and other bodies voted on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7301)|
| 2:01:48| whether they were done with a TIF, payment in lieu of taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| or just out of the operating budget of the city or county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7312)|
| 2:01:55| It's a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7315)|
| 2:01:56| And so back to your Lowe's question, no disrespect to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7316)|
| 2:02:01| I live here, or you, all my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7321)|
| 2:02:05| I tell people all the time that these big box retailers, we're just a dot on the map, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7325)|
| 2:02:11| And our project is no different than Rome, Georgia, or Tuscaloosa, Alabama, or someplace in Florida.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7331)|
| 2:02:21| And so they have a certain amount of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7341)|
| 2:02:24| And we'll go through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7344)|
| 2:02:26| And that's the thing about tonight we need to keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| We're going to be back here with our economic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7349)|
| 2:02:32| and we'll go through their detailed process and go through the cost and go through the returns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7352)|
| 2:02:37| and they will come back and report back, and they'll give a thumbs up or thumbs down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7357)|
| 2:02:41| We may, if we don't like the answer or don't feel like it's accurate or too subjective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7361)|
| 2:02:46| then we may, you know, it's kind of a new process that's been adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7366)|
| 2:02:52| But I believe that hopefully answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7372)|
| 2:02:58| Unfortunately, you're not going to see Lowe's or Wal-Mart or Kroger or Target or Best Buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7378)|
| 2:03:05| or Bed Bath & Beyond pay any more or any less necessarily than they would a similar size market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7385)|
| 2:03:11| And so what we're trying to explain, and obviously when we go through the IDB process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7391)|
| 2:03:18| we will review those costs and you can lay those up against similar type projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7398)|
| 2:03:24| And you'll see that the returns are not the same because of the infrastructure improvements that are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7404)|
| 2:03:31| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7411)|
| 2:03:34| I'm ready to vote on this, so I'm going to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7414)|
| 2:03:38| We have two more lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7418)|
| 2:03:39| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7419)|
| 2:03:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7421)|
| 2:03:46| Mike Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7426)|
| 2:03:52| And not Mike Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7432)|
| 2:03:59| You wanted to know what the commission is asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7439)|
| 2:04:03| I can tell you what I'm asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7443)|
| 2:04:05| I'm not asking for a rubber stamp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7445)|
| 2:04:08| What I am asking for is I want you and the board to use their expertise to take a look at the economic impact this has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7448)|
| 2:04:19| take a look at the costs involved, take a look at the benefits that Knox County will receive and report back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7459)|
| 2:04:32| Now, maybe it's a thumbs down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7472)|
| 2:04:35| Maybe it's a thumbs up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7475)|
| 2:04:36| Maybe it's somewhere in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7476)|
| 2:04:38| Maybe it's that they feel like the TIF should only be a certain dollar amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7478)|
| 2:04:44| and it might be substantially less than the $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7484)|
| 2:04:49| I'm looking for guidance of what they think using their knowledge and their expertise for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7489)|
| 2:05:01| And that's what I'm asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| I don't know what the other commissioners are asking for, but that's what this commissioner is asking for, if that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7503)|
| 2:05:09| That helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7509)|
| 2:05:12| Commissioner Smith, and then we have a call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7512)|
| 2:05:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| Commissioner Lutho, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7517)|
| 2:05:19| I like that and I agree with your comments there and be anxious to hear from Mr. Edwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7519)|
| 2:05:23| Tim, would you come to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| And I want to say a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| It's been a long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7527)|
| 2:05:28| We've got quite a bit more to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7528)|
| 2:05:30| I want to let the commissioners know that I called Mr. Graham this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7530)|
| 2:05:33| I wanted to have lunch with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7533)|
| 2:05:35| And who bought your lunch today, Tim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7535)|
| 2:05:36| You did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7536)|
| 2:05:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7537)|
| 2:05:39| I wanted to know, you know, just all the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7539)|
| 2:05:43| And, Tim, help me as we go through this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7543)|
| 2:05:46| One thing before I do start, I want to mention to Mr. Moore, Chairman Moore,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7546)|
| 2:05:53| I just wanted to mention what was in the paper in there about your parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7553)|
| 2:05:58| I didn't feel too good about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7558)|
| 2:06:00| I think your parents went out there and bought that property some 50 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7560)|
| 2:06:03| And, you know, they were there when Mr. Graham was probably four years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7563)|
| 2:06:08| So I didn't think that that was fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7568)|
| 2:06:10| Also, it was mentioned that Commissioner Moore, myself, and others may have received money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7570)|
| 2:06:17| We'll reiterate one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7577)|
| 2:06:19| I raised over $51,000 in my campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7579)|
| 2:06:22| Mr. Graham gave me $200 of that $51,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7582)|
| 2:06:25| So I don't think that's an influence there on my vote today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7585)|
| 2:06:30| And then Mr. McMillan came.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7590)|
| 2:06:31| And I thought, and I didn't want to say anything against Mr. McMillan, but I thought that he was for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7591)|
| 2:06:36| So I correct myself on there, James.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7596)|
| 2:06:39| I wanted to put words there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7599)|
| 2:06:40| But, James, you did mention a thing about not wanting to move the stream and stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7600)|
| 2:06:45| But I know what you're wanting to do in that first creek, we're wanting to try to get first creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7605)|
| 2:06:49| try to knock how it just winds around, try to cut some of that and shoot straight through it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7609)|
| 2:06:53| so get the water through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7613)|
| 2:06:55| So he's trying to do a little bit of something on the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7615)|
| 2:07:00| I've not received any calls on this whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7620)|
| 2:07:05| These three gentlemen that came up, these are the only three commissioners in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7625)|
| 2:07:11| unless some of you all have had any phone calls or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7631)|
| 2:07:15| I've not received anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| There's quite a bit of talk about comparing your project versus the one down the street and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7637)|
| 2:07:23| There's quite a bit of difference on what that gentleman bought his property for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7643)|
| 2:07:27| was able to get the rates versus what you had to give for your fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7647)|
| 2:07:34| I understand you're saying you're looking at Target and Best Buys and Bed Bath and Beyond stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7654)|
| 2:07:41| stuff like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7661)|
| 2:07:42| Well, that would certainly be ideal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7662)|
| 2:07:44| They are obviously potential tenants for this market area with the income levels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7664)|
| 2:07:49| and the distance from the other stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7669)|
| 2:07:51| Obviously Lowe's is the committed tenant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7671)|
| 2:07:56| and most of the time those tenants follow other lead tenants like Walmart or Home Depot or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7676)|
| 2:08:09| A lot of times, especially if you drive Mainville Highway, people say there's not any sites out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7689)|
| 2:08:16| And so when you have a site, that's a real credit to Turkey Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7696)|
| 2:08:20| Once the road went in, the land was cleared, you know, people could visualize it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7700)|
| 2:08:25| And that's our job as a developer is to take those risks and to provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7705)|
| 2:08:31| And we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7711)|
| 2:08:32| Certainly Lowe's won't pay, even with the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7712)|
| 2:08:35| won't even come close to paying the kind of return we would need for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7715)|
| 2:08:40| And we take the risks that will attract other tenants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7720)|
| 2:08:43| And I'm betting on Hulls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7723)|
| 2:08:45| I believe that Hulls is a great community, has a great demographic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7725)|
| 2:08:49| It's located far enough from other retail areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7729)|
| 2:08:51| And so I'm, you know, as the old adage, putting my money where my mouth is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7731)|
| 2:08:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7736)|
| 2:08:57| You mentioned to me today at lunch that the taxes right now on that property, that taxes is, I wrote down, $5,100 per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7737)|
| 2:09:04| On the shopping center track loan, it's four tracks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7744)|
| 2:09:07| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7747)|
| 2:09:08| $5,100 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7748)|
| 2:09:09| And it's you estimate that by, within two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7749)|
| 2:09:13| that we're going to get some two point, we're going to increase that to 2.2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7753)|
| 2:09:17| plus we'll receive the sales tax off of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7757)|
| 2:09:21| I believe the sales tax is the 2.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7761)|
| 2:09:24| Okay, so 2.2 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7764)|
| 2:09:25| And the property tax from the shopping center is estimated to be close to right at $400,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7765)|
| 2:09:33| after it's built and open, which is an increase of $396,000, $95,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7773)|
| 2:09:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7781)|
| 2:09:42| And we're also getting the greenway, and that greenway will be monitored by TDEC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7782)|
| 2:09:47| The actual construction, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7787)|
| 2:09:49| And I believe the greenway easement is required in our TDEC permit, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7789)|
| 2:09:58| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7798)|
| 2:09:59| And I'm talking about the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7799)|
| 2:10:00| They'll be monitoring the stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7800)|
| 2:10:01| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7801)|
| 2:10:02| So, Commissioner Orman, they'll be watching that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7802)|
| 2:10:07| And you've got the endorsement of Roy Arthur with the Beaver Creek Watershed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7807)|
| 2:10:14| The boundary is going to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7814)|
| 2:10:16| The boundary will come back after Mike Edwards' committee looks at that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7816)|
| 2:10:19| and they'll adjust that boundary or come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7819)|
| 2:10:23| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7823)|
| 2:10:24| The gentleman back there in the back mentioned about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| we're already spending the money in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7826)|
| 2:10:28| That's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7828)|
| 2:10:29| But let me tell you what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7829)|
| 2:10:30| Here's what's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7830)|
| 2:10:31| If you go to Walmart on a Friday night, it's full of Union County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7831)|
| 2:10:35| That's just the fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7835)|
| 2:10:36| And on Saturday, and that's exactly what's going to happen to this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| That project, where he has got this thing located, we're going to get Union –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7839)|
| 2:10:43| we're going to probably get as much dollars from Union County, Campbell County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7843)|
| 2:10:47| I think you mentioned Claiborne County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7847)|
| 2:10:51| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7851)|
| 2:10:52| And up the street, we're going to get a lot of those that we're not getting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7852)|
| 2:10:58| I've always said if you put a Walmart and a Kroger's in Union County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| it would cut a lot of traffic down the halls there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7862)|
| 2:11:05| But they never, never have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7865)|
| 2:11:07| This man has been working on this project for over five years and decided to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7867)|
| 2:11:12| But to recap, he's wanted some $6.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7872)|
| 2:11:15| Now we're down, Commissioner Luthold, down to $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7875)|
| 2:11:18| And with that, it may come back even lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7878)|
| 2:11:20| With what my group comes back, he's gone from 20 years down, he's lowered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7880)|
| 2:11:25| And what I like about the annexation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7885)|
| 2:11:27| that's what a lot of people are concerned with in the halls there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| is with the annexation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7889)|
| 2:11:31| And he's agreed to that, and I'm happy for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7891)|
| 2:11:34| Putting in three red lights there, the Corrie Road is a bad road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7894)|
| 2:11:39| It really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7899)|
| 2:11:41| The new road that you're making that's coming from Maryville Highway to Emory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7901)|
| 2:11:45| what's the length of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7905)|
| 2:11:46| How long is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7906)|
| 2:11:48| Probably 21 to 2,400 linear feet, half a mile almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7908)|
| 2:11:53| You know, Commissioner, this is a brand-new road that he's building there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7913)|
| 2:11:57| He's also going to be widening Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7917)|
| 2:11:59| The state's not going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7919)|
| 2:12:00| You're going to do that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7920)|
| 2:12:02| At the intersections, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7922)|
| 2:12:04| And this is just to reiterate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7924)|
| 2:12:06| This is what Mike said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7926)|
| 2:12:07| This is just one step.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7927)|
| 2:12:09| They're going to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7929)|
| 2:12:10| We're going to look at this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7930)|
| 2:12:12| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7932)|
| 2:12:15| Okay, we're going to vote on the amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7935)|
| 2:12:18| If I'm correct, it's a $5 million cap paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7938)|
| 2:12:22| It's annexed, 15-year limitation, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7942)|
| 2:12:26| Mr. Chairman, am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7946)|
| 2:12:28| Following a vote on the amendment will be a vote on the overall proposal as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7948)|
| 2:12:32| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7952)|
| 2:12:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=7953)|

| 2:14:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8091)|
| 2:14:52| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8092)|
| 2:14:53| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8093)|
| 2:14:54| I am in agreement with the need for something to allow Knox County to have a special election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8094)|
| 2:14:58| should we have a situation like we encountered just a few months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8098)|
| 2:15:04| Mr. Law Director, I believe I had asked for you to look into the possibility of a charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8104)|
| 2:15:08| amendment on this and you were going to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8108)|
| 2:15:11| Do you have anything to report for us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8111)|
| 2:15:13| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8113)|
| 2:15:16| I have certainly looked into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8116)|
| 2:15:19| I have talked with the state AG's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8119)|
| 2:15:26| I've also drafted a letter that I haven't sent yet to the state AG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8126)|
| 2:15:32| Actually, it is to Senators Burchett and Woodson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8132)|
| 2:15:40| And with your all's permission, I'll send it if that is what you want me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8140)|
| 2:15:47| But it basically asks a number of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8147)|
| 2:15:50| One, is this an appropriate matter to consider by the legislature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8150)|
| 2:15:57| Is this something that is constitutional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8157)|
| 2:16:02| We are a charter county government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8162)|
| 2:16:05| Our charter has certainly been under fire over the last couple of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8165)|
| 2:16:13| And we have successfully defended our charter along with the rights that go along with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8173)|
| 2:16:21| which I believe can include such a remedy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8181)|
| 2:16:27| The State Attorney General is probably going to disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8187)|
| 2:16:32| The preliminary indication that I get from the state AG's office is that the Constitution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8192)|
| 2:16:44| will not allow for a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8204)|
| 2:16:48| Of course, we've been through somewhat of a discussion about that over the past 11 months or so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8208)|
| 2:16:58| But if the voters of this county wish to vote on such a referendum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8218)|
| 2:17:04| and we place it before them and they approve it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8224)|
| 2:17:09| with us being a charter form of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8229)|
| 2:17:13| with what I believe is the authority to enact such a provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8233)|
| 2:17:23| it would at least be my opinion that we could go forward with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8243)|
| 2:17:31| Like I say, I don't believe the state AG will agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8251)|
| 2:17:36| They disagreed with our term limit referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8256)|
| 2:17:42| They disagreed certainly with whether you could term limit commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8262)|
| 2:17:50| whether you could term limit the other elected officers of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8270)|
| 2:17:56| And it was determined by the Supreme Court that they were wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8276)|
| 2:18:02| Partially wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8282)|
| 2:18:04| Partially wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8284)|
| 2:18:06| That is, as far as term limits go, with the exception of school board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8286)|
| 2:18:12| because there's a state statute that addresses school board members serving consecutive terms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8292)|
| 2:18:20| serving more than one term, and basically there not being a limitation on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8300)|
| 2:18:25| And judicial clerks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8305)|
| 2:18:26| Judicial clerks, because they derive their authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8306)|
| 2:18:32| all of their authority from a different provision in the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8312)|
| 2:18:39| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8319)|
| 2:18:42| So, yes, at least it was certainly worth going to the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8322)|
| 2:18:47| It was certainly worth that case being tried because they made those clarifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8327)|
| 2:18:55| And you'll notice that we have also included an election provision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8335)|
| 2:19:03| within the referendum that you're going to look at tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8343)|
| 2:19:07| the recall amendment referendum that you're going to look at tonight on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8347)|
| 2:19:12| We've also included it in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8352)|
| 2:19:15| And that's because we believe that as a charter form of government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8355)|
| 2:19:20| we have the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8360)|
| 2:19:24| The voters of this county have the authority to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8364)|
| 2:19:27| They have the authority, we believe, under our enabling legislation to set the course for this government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8367)|
| 2:19:34| which includes a recall amendment, certainly, which we believe also will include a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8374)|
| 2:19:42| So that is why we have recommended those changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8382)|
| 2:19:46| I'd be glad to send a letter to Senators Burchett and Woodson, ask for answers to all of those questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8386)|
| 2:19:54| which includes the recall amendment question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8394)|
| 2:19:57| I would suggest, though, that if that is what this body wishes for me to do, I'll be glad to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8397)|
| 2:20:04| but that we proceed, that we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8404)|
| 2:20:09| We are certainly of the opinion that we should, from a legal standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8409)|
| 2:20:14| that we are certainly enabled to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8414)|
| 2:20:17| I would not see any reason why we couldn't send a letter just to get some answers and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8417)|
| 2:20:22| but I'm in agreement with you on the Attorney General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8422)|
| 2:20:24| It was the Attorney General that made that ruling on term limits in the beginning that the State Supreme Court overturned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8424)|
| 2:20:30| And the State Supreme Court was very clear, as I read their ruling, that the citizens of this county, by referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8430)|
| 2:20:36| The will of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8436)|
| 2:20:38| And so I'm very much in favor of moving ahead with that, and we need to get it on the ballot in August?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8438)|
| 2:20:44| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8444)|
| 2:20:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8445)|
| 2:20:46| So I fully intend to do that and get together with you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8446)|
| 2:20:55| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8455)|
| 2:20:56| Hang on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8456)|
| 2:20:57| Commissioner Lutho, and then we'll come to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8457)|
| 2:21:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8460)|
| 2:21:06| John, I respect your opinion, but I have to disagree with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8466)|
| 2:21:13| I think that we start going down this road of deciding which laws of the State of Tennessee we want to follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8473)|
| 2:21:21| and which laws of the State of Tennessee we think we can supersede.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8481)|
| 2:21:26| I think it's a slippery slope to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8486)|
| 2:21:30| This county has been involved in lawsuit after lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8490)|
| 2:21:38| and although I like being able to let Knox County vote on issues that directly impact us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8498)|
| 2:21:55| I think when we veer too far away from what state law is, I think we open ourselves to further lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8515)|
| 2:22:08| And I think we need to research that a lot further than we have, with all due respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8528)|
| 2:22:17| because the state Supreme Court, although he said, yes, you can term limit commissioners, the mayor, and some other offices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8537)|
| 2:22:27| it also came back and says, no, you can't term limit some others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8547)|
| 2:22:31| So the Supreme Court did put a limitation on our charter and what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8551)|
| 2:22:43| They didn't say you can supersede all state laws in the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8563)|
| 2:22:49| It did put limitations on our charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8569)|
| 2:22:54| I'm not saying that's good or bad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8574)|
| 2:22:55| I'm just saying the way I interpreted what the Supreme Court said about our charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8575)|
| 2:23:01| and what we can and what we can't do within it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8581)|
| 2:23:05| And there are some limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8585)|
| 2:23:08| And I'm just fearful that if we continue down the road of trying to say, well, the state law is this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8588)|
| 2:23:18| but we think we can do that and so, by golly, that's what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8598)|
| 2:23:24| And before we do that, I think, you know, I don't have a problem with being able to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8604)|
| 2:23:32| but I think we should try to do it within the context of trying to change state law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8612)|
| 2:23:37| not just simply changing our charter and then hoping that a court upholds what we just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8617)|
| 2:23:46| I just think that's a bad thing to do is to set ourselves up to another lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8626)|
| 2:23:55| There very well may be another lawsuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8635)|
| 2:23:59| No matter what the voters of this county do as far as the referendum goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8639)|
| 2:24:05| but that's why the courts are there is so that we can test those provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8645)|
| 2:24:10| You know, we are only the second charter county in this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8650)|
| 2:24:16| We didn't know until 2006 whether the voters' decision to term limit the members of this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8656)|
| 2:24:25| was going to be upheld.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8665)|
| 2:24:29| And it took two legal challenges, really, for that to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8669)|
| 2:24:34| What you have as far as state law is concerned related to a special election with regard to a referendum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8674)|
| 2:24:42| I think, is silence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8682)|
| 2:24:44| I think you have silence there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8684)|
| 2:24:47| And I believe where there is silence, then we can speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8687)|
| 2:24:52| I believe the voters of this county can speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8692)|
| 2:24:55| and they can come up with their voting scheme in order to address a special election under certain circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8695)|
| 2:25:03| Now, it may be that, you know, maybe I, the preliminary indications that I get from the State Attorney General's office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8703)|
| 2:25:12| will be more complete once they have reviewed the information that we will submit to them along with my letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8712)|
| 2:25:25| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8725)|
| 2:25:26| But they aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8726)|
| 2:25:28| The State Attorney General's office is not the final authority in this state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8728)|
| 2:25:33| And I understand that, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8733)|
| 2:25:36| But I'm just saying, and believe me, I would have loved to have been able to have had a special election, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8736)|
| 2:25:42| I would love to be able to let the voters of Knox County decide a lot of issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8742)|
| 2:25:51| but we're still part of the state of Tennessee, and we still swear an oath to uphold the laws of the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8751)|
| 2:26:01| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8761)|
| 2:26:02| Along with the U.S. Constitution and the Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8762)|
| 2:26:07| And I'm just not, you know, maybe I'm a little gun shy, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8767)|
| 2:26:12| Maybe I'm tired of getting sued, and I just see us opening up that possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8772)|
| 2:26:20| I think we need to research it more and find out what the State Attorney General, not that he's the final arbiter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8780)|
| 2:26:29| but find out what they have to say before we start going down this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8789)|
| 2:26:34| I'm just wanting us to be cautious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8794)|
| 2:26:36| We have researched it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8796)|
| 2:26:37| We have lived it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8797)|
| 2:26:40| I, in my office, we've defended the Jordan case on September the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8800)|
| 2:26:45| I was there arguing Knox County's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8805)|
| 2:26:49| We've lived it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8809)|
| 2:26:50| We've gone through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8810)|
| 2:26:53| And let's take the Supreme Court at its word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8813)|
| 2:26:57| The will of the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8817)|
| 2:26:58| Let's take them at their word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8818)|
| 2:27:00| The will of the people of Knox County also wanted the school board term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8820)|
| 2:27:05| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8825)|
| 2:27:06| They wanted the judicial limited, but the Supreme Court came back and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8826)|
| 2:27:12| guys, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8832)|
| 2:27:14| You can do this, but you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8834)|
| 2:27:16| And we need to find out what we can and what we can't do before we just start trying to figure out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8836)|
| 2:27:22| well, let's just do it all and then we'll just wait until the courts decide what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8842)|
| 2:27:27| That's what's got us in this mess to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8847)|
| 2:27:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8849)|
| 2:27:30| Because we waited for the courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8850)|
| 2:27:32| Yes, it is, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8852)|
| 2:27:33| If we would have asked the courts back in 1995, not the Attorney General, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8853)|
| 2:27:38| the courts came back and said, guys, here's the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8858)|
| 2:27:42| You could not ask them in 1995.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8862)|
| 2:27:45| First of all, you have to have a case or controversy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8865)|
| 2:27:49| One of the first rules of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| You have to have a case or controversy to get it before the court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8871)|
| 2:27:53| That could not occur in 1995.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8873)|
| 2:27:55| Then it couldn't happen until 2006 then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8875)|
| 2:27:58| Until Shelby County, until the issue was brought to a head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8878)|
| 2:28:01| and Shelby County was the first opportunity to bring that matter to the court's attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8881)|
| 2:28:06| Well, then what I fear, John, is let's say this happens for some reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8886)|
| 2:28:12| Let's hope to God this never happens again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8892)|
| 2:28:14| Let's say that happens again and this passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8894)|
| 2:28:20| And we hold an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8900)|
| 2:28:23| Someone's elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8903)|
| 2:28:24| Then all of a sudden someone decides to challenge that election because they're going to say, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8904)|
| 2:28:29| the state doesn't give you guys the power to hold that election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8909)|
| 2:28:36| And then we're back in court again deciding whether or not we just held a valid election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8916)|
| 2:28:40| I just, you know, I just think it's a slippery slope to go and try to figure out where we want to follow state laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8920)|
| 2:28:50| and which state laws that we don't think we have to follow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8930)|
| 2:28:55| As far as providing for a special election, certainly we have reviewed that statute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8935)|
| 2:29:02| and it is silent as far as a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8942)|
| 2:29:07| We believe that as a charter county government enabled to certainly enact legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8947)|
| 2:29:18| to enact ordinances that we could provide for such a circumstance through our charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8958)|
| 2:29:24| that the people of this county could provide for that within their charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8964)|
| 2:29:32| Like I say, I think we take the Supreme Court at its word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8972)|
| 2:29:37| The Supreme Court cited, unanimously cited the will of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8977)|
| 2:29:43| If it is the will of the people of this county that we have a recall amendment that also includes a special election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8983)|
| 2:29:53| But there's state law that allows us to hold a recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8993)|
| 2:29:56| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8996)|
| 2:29:57| We're following state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8997)|
| 2:29:58| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=8998)|
| 2:30:01| Along with a special election provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9001)|
| 2:30:05| Special election provision is not provided for within that state law section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9005)|
| 2:30:12| Well, I just hope you're right because I see some dire consequences if you're wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9012)|
| 2:30:20| Well, the dire consequences would be that the will of this people as voted on, if it's approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9020)|
| 2:30:28| if it's approved in August, that the people do, that their will is not met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9028)|
| 2:30:34| And the state Supreme Court one of these days, I guess, may tell us that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9034)|
| 2:30:39| But until then, I think we should proceed through our enabling statute as if we certainly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9039)|
| 2:30:47| where a statute is silent, that we can proceed and create our ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9047)|
| 2:30:55| create our charter through the will of the people of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9055)|
| 2:31:00| I mean, what we didn't know prior to the Jordan case was whether we could totally restructure our government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9060)|
| 2:31:08| I mean, the Supreme Court just told us that we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9068)|
| 2:31:12| and because Shelby County is going through this right now as a result of the Jordan case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9072)|
| 2:31:17| the Supreme Court went further in the Jordan case and told us that we could have appointed offices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9077)|
| 2:31:22| for all of these fee offices, the office of the trustee, the office of the property assessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9082)|
| 2:31:28| the office of the sheriff could be an appointed office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9088)|

| 2:31:37| If we can totally restructure Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9097)|
| 2:31:40| surely to goodness the Supreme Court wouldn't turn away the will of the citizens of this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9100)|
| 2:31:45| in having a special election through a recall amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9105)|
| 2:31:48| Well, they turned away the will of the people asking that the school board be term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9108)|
| 2:31:52| They turned away the will of the people for the judicial clerks to be term limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9112)|
| 2:31:57| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9117)|
| 2:32:00| Part of that referendum also asks that our state and federal representatives be term limited as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9120)|
| 2:32:10| I mean, we're not following what the will of the people asks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9130)|
| 2:32:14| You know, part of that referendum asks that we send a letter out to every government, local, state, federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9134)|
| 2:32:25| to impose term limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9145)|
| 2:32:27| We don't follow that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9147)|
| 2:32:28| We need to start doing that if that's what we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9148)|
| 2:32:31| That's what the people voted on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9151)|
| 2:32:34| We had a provision within the term limits amendment that certainly provided that we could ignore certain provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9154)|
| 2:32:48| that weren't in total compliance with the Tennessee Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9168)|
| 2:32:54| We certainly will have such a provision as far as our recall amendment is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9174)|
| 2:33:00| If it turns out that the Supreme Court does not agree with if that is passed by this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9180)|
| 2:33:06| and passed by the citizens of Knox County, if they do not agree with that provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9186)|
| 2:33:10| then they can excise that provision from the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9190)|
| 2:33:16| But I certainly believe that it is certainly a strong, arguable position that we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9196)|
| 2:33:28| as a charter county government, may include such a provision within this charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9208)|
| 2:33:36| Well, it's not that I'm not against the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9216)|
| 2:33:38| I'm for the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9218)|
| 2:33:41| I just think we need to be very cautious as we go down this road because I don't want to see us being sued again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9221)|
| 2:33:54| and then we're in turmoil again because of the possible consequences of not knowing how that lawsuit could turn out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9234)|
| 2:34:03| I'm not advocating lawsuits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9243)|
| 2:34:05| I'm not either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9245)|
| 2:34:06| I'm trying to prevent them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9246)|
| 2:34:07| I'm advocating what we believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9247)|
| 2:34:09| I'm just trying to speak a word of caution before we go down that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9249)|
| 2:34:13| Gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9253)|
| 2:34:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9254)|
| 2:34:15| I appreciate that legal and historical discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9255)|
| 2:34:18| It was thoughtful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9258)|
| 2:34:20| But it's not really about the resolution before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9260)|
| 2:34:24| You're talking about a county charter resolution, mostly, or a county charter change regarding this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9264)|
| 2:34:29| It involves the same subject, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9269)|
| 2:34:31| It involves the same subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9271)|
| 2:34:33| But the subject matter before us is a simple resolution asking the state legislature, in particular Senator Tim Burchett,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9273)|
| 2:34:40| to introduce a special election provision for all Tennessee counties when simultaneous multiple vacancies occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9280)|
| 2:34:48| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9288)|
| 2:34:49| And that I can agree with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9289)|
| 2:34:50| And that's all before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9290)|
| 2:34:52| So I think we're at the point now where we've reduced it to what's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9292)|
| 2:34:56| We probably should vote on what's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9296)|
| 2:34:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9299)|

| 2:35:58| We're over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9358)|
| 2:36:00| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9360)|
| 2:36:02| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9362)|
| 2:36:03| I'd like to amend this motion in talking with our IT people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9363)|
| 2:36:06| My thought process was audio streaming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9366)|
| 2:36:08| They're also saying that there's a possibility of video streaming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9368)|
| 2:36:12| And so we would need to really look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9372)|
| 2:36:14| So I'd like to amend this to say that we will have a recommendation by February 1 on how this would work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9374)|
| 2:36:22| in working with our IT department and looking at those who do possible audio and video streaming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9382)|
| 2:36:27| I think it's a good idea to be able to have it so people who don't have cable can pick up the meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9387)|
| 2:36:32| if they want, off of their computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9392)|
| 2:36:34| But to look at the type of streaming and also look at all of the logistical needs of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9394)|
| 2:36:41| I'd like to amend that to say that we will have a report for you by February 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9401)|
| 2:36:45| So I'll make that in the form of a motion rather than saying we're going to do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9405)|
| 2:36:48| that we will have a report for you on how it would work by February 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-071217-part-2-business?start=9408)|
