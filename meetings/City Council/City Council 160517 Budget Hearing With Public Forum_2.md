| 2:55:28| next to the fire station in Burlington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10528)|
| 2:55:30| guys tell me that you beat the heck out of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10530)|
| 2:55:32| trucks riding on that bumpy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10532)|
| 2:55:34| washboard short road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10534)|
| 2:55:36| did we ever decide to pave that or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10536)|
| 2:55:38| they're doing some work on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10538)|
| 2:55:40| I was out there within the last few weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10540)|
| 2:55:42| and they were doing some work on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10542)|
| 2:55:44| patching it or something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10544)|
| 2:55:46| as far as headquarters, what that means is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10546)|
| 2:55:48| paving the fire station at Locust and Summit Hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10548)|
| 2:55:50| that headquarters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10550)|
| 2:55:52| but in terms of paving that side street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10552)|
| 2:55:54| that gets you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10554)|
| 2:55:56| Rutledge Pike or the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10556)|
| 2:55:58| the first one you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10558)|
| 2:56:00| the Bearden thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10560)|
| 2:56:02| I'm sorry, Burlington| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10562)|
| 2:56:04| we are working on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10564)|
| 2:56:06| I don't have an update exactly as to where we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10566)|
| 2:56:08| we did take a look at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10568)|
| 2:56:10| absolutely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10570)|
| 2:56:12| and we'll follow up on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10572)|
| 2:56:14| appreciate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10574)|
| 2:56:16| and I guess with your building maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10576)|
| 2:56:18| you've got all those projects underway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10578)|
| 2:56:20| the repairs you did to two or three stations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10580)|
| 2:56:22| yes, we finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10582)|
| 2:56:24| station 7 in Lonsdale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10584)|
| 2:56:26| I know some of you over there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10586)|
| 2:56:28| and it looks great, they did a great job on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10588)|
| 2:56:30| we were able to preserve that old building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10590)|
| 2:56:32| we're still working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10592)|
| 2:56:34| some of the other ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10594)|
| 2:56:36| especially station 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10596)|
| 2:56:38| which is a little more difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10598)|
| 2:56:40| station to deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10600)|
| 2:56:42| that's the Lona station on Lion's View| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10602)|
| 2:56:44| it's historic structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10604)|
| 2:56:46| and it's pretty complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10606)|
| 2:56:48| but we are working on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10608)|
| 2:56:50| we've been working on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10610)|
| 2:56:52| but we'll hopefully get that renovated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10612)|
| 2:56:54| do fire stations serve as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10614)|
| 2:56:56| a safe house for kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10616)|
| 2:56:58| or someone who might be in trouble?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10618)|
| 2:57:00| they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10620)|
| 2:57:02| we're marked accordingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10622)|
| 2:57:04| and trained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10624)|
| 2:57:06| and have the policies out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10626)|
| 2:57:08| where everybody knows what to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10628)|
| 2:57:10| if it happens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10630)|
| 2:57:12| how often are those used in a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10632)|
| 2:57:14| it depends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10634)|
| 2:57:16| on that particular truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10636)|
| 2:57:18| but there is someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10638)|
| 2:57:20| using one of their sets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10640)|
| 2:57:23| on a daily basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10643)|
| 2:57:25| sometimes it's as simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10645)|
| 2:57:27| as a door| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10647)|
| 2:57:29| just got jammed in a truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10649)|
| 2:57:31| in a vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10651)|
| 2:57:33| that's been in a wreck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10653)|
| 2:57:35| and you can use the jaws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10655)|
| 2:57:37| just to pop it open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10657)|
| 2:57:39| to a lot more complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10659)|
| 2:57:41| in some of the major crashes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10661)|
| 2:57:43| but we use them on a daily basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10663)|
| 2:57:45| probably on average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10665)|
| 2:57:47| multiple times per day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10667)|
| 2:57:49| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10669)|
| 2:57:51| any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| ok thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10673)|
| 2:57:59| the final| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10679)|
| 2:58:01| department head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10681)|
| 2:58:03| on your agenda is going to be civil service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10683)|
| 2:58:05| and then after that we'll take a break for lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10685)|
| 2:58:07| and come back at 1.30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10687)|
| 2:58:09| so Vicky| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10689)|
| 2:58:11| this is on page 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10691)|
| 2:58:13| I love being right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10693)|
| 2:58:15| before lunch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10695)|
| 2:58:17| because everybody is ready to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10697)|
| 2:58:19| that concludes our presentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10699)|
| 2:58:21| I usually don't spend a lot of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10701)|
| 2:58:23| talking about my budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10703)|
| 2:58:25| although this is a budget hearing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10705)|
| 2:58:27| because our budget is pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10707)|
| 2:58:29| small, pretty standard, pretty unglamorous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10709)|
| 2:58:31| the only thing I really did want to highlight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10711)|
| 2:58:33| relative to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10713)|
| 2:58:35| budget simply because it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10715)|
| 2:58:37| not something that occurs every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10717)|
| 2:58:39| and it's the only thing that's sort of a deviation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10719)|
| 2:58:41| for us is that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10721)|
| 2:58:43| we just started the process of hiring a police academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10723)|
| 2:58:45| so one of our largest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10725)|
| 2:58:47| spendable items in our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10727)|
| 2:58:49| is our professional services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10729)|
| 2:58:51| budget and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10731)|
| 2:58:53| pretty much is reserved for either| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10733)|
| 2:58:55| hiring a police academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10735)|
| 2:58:57| or for doing promotional processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10737)|
| 2:58:59| in police so we don't tap into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10739)|
| 2:59:01| every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10741)|
| 2:59:03| this year we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10743)|
| 2:59:05| because we just posted a couple of weeks ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10745)|
| 2:59:07| for police officer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10747)|
| 2:59:09| that's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10749)|
| 2:59:11| close out in a couple of weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10751)|
| 2:59:13| and we'll begin the process of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10753)|
| 2:59:15| processing those applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10755)|
| 2:59:17| at that point so that involves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10757)|
| 2:59:19| psychological and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10759)|
| 2:59:21| an expense there. We also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10761)|
| 2:59:23| developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10763)|
| 2:59:25| a new written| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10765)|
| 2:59:27| process of developing a new written exam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10767)|
| 2:59:29| for police officer recruit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10769)|
| 2:59:31| and a new physical performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10771)|
| 2:59:33| test for police officer recruit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10773)|
| 2:59:35| those have not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10775)|
| 2:59:37| updated since the 80's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10777)|
| 2:59:39| so it just felt like a good time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10779)|
| 2:59:41| and we found a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10781)|
| 2:59:43| good, well established, reputable company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10783)|
| 2:59:45| that was really eager to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10785)|
| 2:59:47| obtain our data. It's a tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10787)|
| 2:59:49| amount of work mostly on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10789)|
| 2:59:51| the part of the police department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10791)|
| 2:59:53| they're having to do a lot of work, a lot of forms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10793)|
| 2:59:55| go through a lot of processes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10795)|
| 2:59:57| to collect this data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10797)|
| 2:59:59| but the company was very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10799)|
| 3:00:01| interested in getting our data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10801)|
| 3:00:03| because we have a large department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10803)|
| 3:00:05| and that's very useful to them so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10805)|
| 3:00:07| were given a really good price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10807)|
| 3:00:09| so we're getting a brand new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10809)|
| 3:00:11| written exam and PPT out of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10811)|
| 3:00:13| which I think is going to be great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10813)|
| 3:00:15| going forward so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10815)|
| 3:00:17| we're in the middle of that process right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10817)|
| 3:00:19| that's really the only thing relative to my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10819)|
| 3:00:21| budget unless anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10821)|
| 3:00:23| has any specific questions otherwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10823)|
| 3:00:25| I was just going to talk a little bit about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10825)|
| 3:00:27| the salary survey and the class comp changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10827)|
| 3:00:31| Okay, moving on to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10831)|
| 3:00:33| because we haven't done class comp changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10833)|
| 3:00:35| sort of what I consider the standard way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10835)|
| 3:00:37| which is sort of the way they've always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10837)|
| 3:00:39| been done in the past since about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10839)|
| 3:00:41| 2007 I thought it was a good opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10841)|
| 3:00:43| to just sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10843)|
| 3:00:45| brief all of you guys on what that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10845)|
| 3:00:47| normally looks like in the time that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10847)|
| 3:00:49| most of you have been on council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10849)|
| 3:00:51| we've been doing something that is sort of a deviation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10851)|
| 3:00:53| from our normal process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10853)|
| 3:00:55| either with Mercer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10855)|
| 3:00:57| which was certainly a deviation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10857)|
| 3:00:59| from what we normally do and then the follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10859)|
| 3:01:01| up with Siegel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10861)|
| 3:01:03| was also a deviation because those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10863)|
| 3:01:05| processes brought in an external consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10865)|
| 3:01:07| and the goal of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10867)|
| 3:01:09| process was not simply to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10869)|
| 3:01:11| the structure and see if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10871)|
| 3:01:13| any structure changes need to be made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10873)|
| 3:01:15| but it was also to review every| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10875)|
| 3:01:17| individual employee and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10877)|
| 3:01:19| salary relative to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10879)|
| 3:01:21| structure and make adjustments to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10881)|
| 3:01:23| individual employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10883)|
| 3:01:25| going back to pre-Mercer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10885)|
| 3:01:27| typically what my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10887)|
| 3:01:29| class comp process looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10889)|
| 3:01:31| like is we conduct the annual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10891)|
| 3:01:33| salary survey and the purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10893)|
| 3:01:35| of the salary survey is to look at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10895)|
| 3:01:37| overall integrity of the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10897)|
| 3:01:39| not to look at the pay of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10899)|
| 3:01:41| individual employees so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10901)|
| 3:01:43| typically I look at the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10903)|
| 3:01:45| compare that structure to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10905)|
| 3:01:47| structures of our peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10907)|
| 3:01:49| in the market and see if we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10909)|
| 3:01:51| to move those structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10911)|
| 3:01:53| upward to keep up with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10913)|
| 3:01:55| the market so that's what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10915)|
| 3:01:57| did this year this is really the first year we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10917)|
| 3:01:59| done just that since probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10919)|
| 3:02:01| 2007 so I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10921)|
| 3:02:03| wanted to briefly explain what that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10923)|
| 3:02:05| looks like so that as you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10925)|
| 3:02:07| look at my recommendations you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10927)|
| 3:02:09| see what we're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10929)|
| 3:02:11| basically I look at the midpoints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10931)|
| 3:02:13| we survey the midpoints for each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10933)|
| 3:02:15| structure I build the structure out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10935)|
| 3:02:17| from the midpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10937)|
| 3:02:19| so if our midpoints are falling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10939)|
| 3:02:21| behind the midpoints of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10941)|
| 3:02:23| our peers and in particular pay grades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10943)|
| 3:02:25| I look at making an adjustment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10945)|
| 3:02:27| upward using that midpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10947)|
| 3:02:29| rebuild the minimum and the maximum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10949)|
| 3:02:31| relative to that and then I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10951)|
| 3:02:33| make those recommendations to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10953)|
| 3:02:35| to raise that structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10955)|
| 3:02:37| do pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10957)|
| 3:02:39| increases result from a structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10959)|
| 3:02:41| adjustment yes but not in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10961)|
| 3:02:43| same manner they did with Mercer or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10963)|
| 3:02:45| Siegel we're not looking at individual employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10965)|
| 3:02:47| and moving them as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10967)|
| 3:02:49| we move the structure most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10969)|
| 3:02:51| employees will stay where they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10971)|
| 3:02:53| the only movement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10973)|
| 3:02:55| that will occur when we make a regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10975)|
| 3:02:57| structure adjustment are any employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10977)|
| 3:02:59| that fall below a new minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10979)|
| 3:03:01| so by rules they have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10981)|
| 3:03:03| all employees have to be captured within that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10983)|
| 3:03:05| pay grade so if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10985)|
| 3:03:07| move the structure up any employees that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10987)|
| 3:03:09| fall below that new minimum have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10989)|
| 3:03:11| to be adjusted upward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10991)|
| 3:03:13| to the new minimum all other employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10993)|
| 3:03:15| would remain static| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10995)|
| 3:03:17| so you can see I've made basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10997)|
| 3:03:19| based on the survey this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=10999)|
| 3:03:21| and it's a trend I've seen for several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11001)|
| 3:03:23| so I felt comfortable making the recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11003)|
| 3:03:25| but we're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11005)|
| 3:03:28| see some need for movement in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11008)|
| 3:03:30| structure in the lower pay grades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11010)|
| 3:03:32| in general government so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11012)|
| 3:03:34| you see that my recommendations focus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11014)|
| 3:03:36| on the lower pay grades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11016)|
| 3:03:38| in police and fire it's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11018)|
| 3:03:40| opposite we've done a good job of catching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11020)|
| 3:03:42| up our entry level pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11022)|
| 3:03:44| and our first or second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11024)|
| 3:03:46| promotional opportunities but where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11026)|
| 3:03:48| continue to fall behind our peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11028)|
| 3:03:50| is on our supervisory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11030)|
| 3:03:52| ranks so my recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11032)|
| 3:03:54| for structure movement in the uniform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11034)|
| 3:03:56| bodies are isolated to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11036)|
| 3:03:58| supervisory ranks and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11038)|
| 3:04:00| any cost associated with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11040)|
| 3:04:02| would be any employees that are now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11042)|
| 3:04:04| trapped below a new minimum we actually have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11044)|
| 3:04:06| adjust them upward to the new minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11046)|
| 3:04:08| happy to answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11048)|
| 3:04:10| any questions that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11050)|
| 3:04:12| have about those recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11052)|
| 3:04:14| any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11054)|
| 3:04:16| Dan? I want to ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11056)|
| 3:04:18| about the lower pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11058)|
| 3:04:20| employees is it a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11060)|
| 3:04:22| huge turnover with those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11062)|
| 3:04:24| employees or do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11064)|
| 3:04:26| many of them continue and make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11066)|
| 3:04:28| a career with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11068)|
| 3:04:30| I wouldn't say we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11070)|
| 3:04:32| huge turnover at all our turnover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11072)|
| 3:04:34| is actually remarkably low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11074)|
| 3:04:36| I think this past year it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11076)|
| 3:04:38| around 3%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11078)|
| 3:04:40| so we actually do have very low turnover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11080)|
| 3:04:42| compared to a lot of our peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11082)|
| 3:04:44| so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11084)|
| 3:04:46| don't have huge turnover but I do see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11086)|
| 3:04:48| more turnover in the lower pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11088)|
| 3:04:50| grades than I do in the higher pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11090)|
| 3:04:52| grades and I think that's a combination of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11092)|
| 3:04:54| factors one of which of course is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11094)|
| 3:04:56| probably salary because those are the lowest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11096)|
| 3:04:58| paid jobs at the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11098)|
| 3:05:00| but you're also looking at a workforce that does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11100)|
| 3:05:02| tend to be more transient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11102)|
| 3:05:04| they do tend to change jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11104)|
| 3:05:06| more often simply because of the nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11106)|
| 3:05:08| of the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11108)|
| 3:05:10| when you compare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11110)|
| 3:05:12| cities you look at cities of similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11112)|
| 3:05:14| size and population and see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11114)|
| 3:05:16| what their salaries are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11116)|
| 3:05:18| yes yes we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11118)|
| 3:05:20| have a group of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11120)|
| 3:05:22| I think it's a little over 100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11122)|
| 3:05:24| municipalities that we send the survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11124)|
| 3:05:26| to and all of them were selected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11126)|
| 3:05:28| because they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11128)|
| 3:05:30| basically that we're focused on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11130)|
| 3:05:32| southeast and we include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11132)|
| 3:05:34| cities that are comparable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11134)|
| 3:05:36| to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11136)|
| 3:05:38| in size, budget, demographics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11138)|
| 3:05:40| as well as some that are slightly above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11140)|
| 3:05:42| us with an equal number that are below us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11142)|
| 3:05:44| so it's a pretty good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11144)|
| 3:05:46| representative group that we get data from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11146)|
| 3:05:48| ok thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11148)|
| 3:05:50| one thing we were talking about earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11150)|
| 3:05:52| was the longevity bonus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11152)|
| 3:05:54| does that come into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11154)|
| 3:05:56| do you take that into account when you compare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11156)|
| 3:05:58| peer to peer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11158)|
| 3:06:00| we don't so one thing that's important to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11160)|
| 3:06:02| when we do the salary survey we're comparing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11162)|
| 3:06:04| base pay to base pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11164)|
| 3:06:06| so our base pay compared to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11166)|
| 3:06:08| peers base pay we don't ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11168)|
| 3:06:10| them they do not include any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11170)|
| 3:06:12| supplemental pay and we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11172)|
| 3:06:14| include any supplemental pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11174)|
| 3:06:16| we did our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11176)|
| 3:06:18| more comprehensive survey with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11178)|
| 3:06:20| Siegel a few years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11180)|
| 3:06:22| that was something that we surveyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11182)|
| 3:06:24| separately we did want to look at various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11184)|
| 3:06:26| supplemental pays and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11186)|
| 3:06:28| don't hold me to this because I don't have it in front of me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11188)|
| 3:06:30| but my memory is that longevity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11190)|
| 3:06:32| was one of the few advantages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11192)|
| 3:06:34| that we had above our peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11194)|
| 3:06:36| our pay does tend to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11196)|
| 3:06:38| fall slightly lower than most of our peers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11198)|
| 3:06:40| but not so much that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11200)|
| 3:06:42| you know we need to make any sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11202)|
| 3:06:44| adjustment but we always do tend to fall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11204)|
| 3:06:46| a little below that was one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11206)|
| 3:06:48| things that gave us a slight advantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11208)|
| 3:06:50| was that longevity pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11210)|
| 3:06:52| to kind of follow up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11212)|
| 3:06:54| on the chief's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11214)|
| 3:06:56| response it also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11216)|
| 3:06:58| we have a real issue in the uniformed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11218)|
| 3:07:00| bodies this doesn't occur so much in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11220)|
| 3:07:02| general government but in the uniformed bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11222)|
| 3:07:04| there is very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11224)|
| 3:07:06| a climate of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11226)|
| 3:07:08| wanting to maintain separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11228)|
| 3:07:10| by tenure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11230)|
| 3:07:12| and by rank and time in rank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11232)|
| 3:07:14| so you've got several factors you're trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11234)|
| 3:07:16| keep employees separated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11236)|
| 3:07:18| into a relative hierarchy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11238)|
| 3:07:20| based on and one is hire date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11240)|
| 3:07:22| but also rank and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11242)|
| 3:07:24| time in that rank and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11244)|
| 3:07:26| longevity is one of the few things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11246)|
| 3:07:28| helps us sort of spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11248)|
| 3:07:30| keep that spread and keep those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11250)|
| 3:07:32| employees from bunching up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11252)|
| 3:07:34| it's a way to separate them by time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11254)|
| 3:07:36| with the city and then our promotional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11256)|
| 3:07:38| processes can help us keep them separated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11258)|
| 3:07:40| by rank and time in rank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11260)|
| 3:07:46| In terms of demographics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11266)|
| 3:07:48| in terms of women, African Americans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11268)|
| 3:07:50| Hispanics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11270)|
| 3:07:52| how are we doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11272)|
| 3:07:54| in that regard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11274)|
| 3:07:56| We're doing pretty well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11276)|
| 3:07:58| that's actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11278)|
| 3:08:00| something that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11280)|
| 3:08:02| track on a regular basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11282)|
| 3:08:04| and for several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11284)|
| 3:08:06| we've held pretty steady| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11286)|
| 3:08:08| on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11288)|
| 3:08:10| hiring overall and it depends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11290)|
| 3:08:12| on what factors you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11292)|
| 3:08:14| if you look at our total hiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11294)|
| 3:08:16| we stay around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11296)|
| 3:08:18| 17%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11298)|
| 3:08:20| hiring and employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11300)|
| 3:08:22| minorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11302)|
| 3:08:24| over our entire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11304)|
| 3:08:26| workforce but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11306)|
| 3:08:28| going to include all of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11308)|
| 3:08:30| event and seasonal positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11310)|
| 3:08:32| if you break it down just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11312)|
| 3:08:34| to regular workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11314)|
| 3:08:36| we maintain about 10%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11316)|
| 3:08:38| and really our target| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11318)|
| 3:08:40| is closer to 11%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11320)|
| 3:08:42| so we're not too far off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11322)|
| 3:08:44| and we've held steady at about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11324)|
| 3:08:46| 10% for about 4 or 5 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11326)|
| 3:08:48| women just to be frank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11328)|
| 3:08:50| we fall short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11330)|
| 3:08:52| we will always fall short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11332)|
| 3:08:54| if your goal is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11334)|
| 3:08:56| to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11336)|
| 3:08:58| something relative to the population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11338)|
| 3:09:00| our goal would be somewhere around 50%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11340)|
| 3:09:02| we tend to hover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11342)|
| 3:09:05| around 27%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11345)|
| 3:09:07| for the total workforce and around 20%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11347)|
| 3:09:09| for the regular workforce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11349)|
| 3:09:11| for women but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11351)|
| 3:09:13| the majority of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11353)|
| 3:09:15| the bulk of our positions are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11355)|
| 3:09:17| public service, police and fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11357)|
| 3:09:19| and we simply do not get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11359)|
| 3:09:21| a large number of female applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11361)|
| 3:09:23| for those jobs. It's not a matter of not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11363)|
| 3:09:25| hiring the females we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11365)|
| 3:09:27| we simply don't get them applying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11367)|
| 3:09:29| and in terms of management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11369)|
| 3:09:31| positions within the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11371)|
| 3:09:33| city, how do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11373)|
| 3:09:35| stand with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11375)|
| 3:09:37| how are we looking? I don't think I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11377)|
| 3:09:39| that specifically broken out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11379)|
| 3:09:41| I'm going to look and see if I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11381)|
| 3:09:43| you can tell us later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11383)|
| 3:09:45| if you don't have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11385)|
| 3:09:49| I don't think I have it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11389)|
| 3:09:51| specifically by position that's something I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11391)|
| 3:09:53| actually have to run especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11393)|
| 3:09:55| we did do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11395)|
| 3:09:57| I want to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11397)|
| 3:09:59| within the last year I think we actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11399)|
| 3:10:01| did run that data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11401)|
| 3:10:03| and my memory is that when it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11403)|
| 3:10:05| to our professional positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11405)|
| 3:10:07| we actually have a very good representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11407)|
| 3:10:09| of minorities and women| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11409)|
| 3:10:11| but I can get that specific data to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11411)|
| 3:10:13| ok thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11413)|
| 3:10:15| any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11415)|
| 3:10:17| yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11417)|
| 3:10:19| you answered most of this question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11419)|
| 3:10:21| but on that peer to peer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11421)|
| 3:10:23| analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11423)|
| 3:10:25| you talked about 100 cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11425)|
| 3:10:27| do you also factor in cost of living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11427)|
| 3:10:29| in other words if you live in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11429)|
| 3:10:31| it costs you a lot more to have a house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11431)|
| 3:10:33| do you factor that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11433)|
| 3:10:35| or adjust the weight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11435)|
| 3:10:37| of a city's wage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11437)|
| 3:10:39| we did that last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11439)|
| 3:10:41| that was the first time we'd done that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11441)|
| 3:10:43| I incorporated that because that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11443)|
| 3:10:45| one of the things Segal had done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11445)|
| 3:10:47| so I did incorporate that last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11447)|
| 3:10:49| I chose not to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11449)|
| 3:10:51| incorporate it this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11451)|
| 3:10:53| because it's very, just to be frank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11453)|
| 3:10:55| it's very difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11455)|
| 3:10:57| for someone like me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11457)|
| 3:10:59| with the data I have access to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11459)|
| 3:11:01| to come up with a really good reliable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11461)|
| 3:11:03| figure to use for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11463)|
| 3:11:05| Segal, Mercer, they have resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11465)|
| 3:11:07| I don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11467)|
| 3:11:09| and I just didn't feel comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11469)|
| 3:11:11| to be frank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11471)|
| 3:11:13| I didn't have a tremendous amount of confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11473)|
| 3:11:15| in that data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11475)|
| 3:11:17| and so I prefer to just look at the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11477)|
| 3:11:19| compared to the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11479)|
| 3:11:21| I look at the respondent pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11481)|
| 3:11:23| and basically if our respondent pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11483)|
| 3:11:25| in larger cities that I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11485)|
| 3:11:27| have a significantly higher cost of living| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11487)|
| 3:11:31| pay significantly more than we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11491)|
| 3:11:33| if we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11493)|
| 3:11:35| loaded heavy on that end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11495)|
| 3:11:37| then I probably would take that into account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11497)|
| 3:11:39| in making my recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11499)|
| 3:11:41| but what I do is I do actually look at our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11501)|
| 3:11:43| respondent pool to ensure that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11503)|
| 3:11:45| pretty balanced, that we're sort of in the middle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11505)|
| 3:11:47| and so because of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11507)|
| 3:11:49| I don't feel it's as important to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11509)|
| 3:11:51| adjustment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11511)|
| 3:11:53| You saw a real difference in Segal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11513)|
| 3:11:55| when they added it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11515)|
| 3:11:57| It really does change the data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11517)|
| 3:11:59| and I guess that's probably one reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11519)|
| 3:12:01| I lean away from it unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11521)|
| 3:12:03| I see that our respondents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11523)|
| 3:12:05| are heavy on one end versus the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11525)|
| 3:12:07| In terms of your uniform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11527)|
| 3:12:09| employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11529)|
| 3:12:11| would you expect that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11531)|
| 3:12:13| the more attractive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11533)|
| 3:12:15| wages are going to be in big cities as opposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11535)|
| 3:12:17| to small ones? In other words, if you go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11537)|
| 3:12:19| Atlanta or Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11539)|
| 3:12:21| They do pay significantly better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11541)|
| 3:12:23| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11543)|
| 3:12:25| I don't really see much of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11545)|
| 3:12:27| turnover being for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11547)|
| 3:12:29| individuals that are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11549)|
| 3:12:31| a larger city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11551)|
| 3:12:33| either in a different area of the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11553)|
| 3:12:35| or a different state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11555)|
| 3:12:37| Most of our uniformed folks live here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11557)|
| 3:12:39| and want to live here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11559)|
| 3:12:41| If we lose individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11561)|
| 3:12:43| it's typically to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11563)|
| 3:12:45| private security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11565)|
| 3:12:47| which pays significantly more than we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11567)|
| 3:12:49| Is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11569)|
| 3:12:51| any trend that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11571)|
| 3:12:53| you feel is adverse in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11573)|
| 3:12:55| we train good employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11575)|
| 3:12:57| but they find better jobs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11577)|
| 3:12:59| somewhere else? In other words, is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11579)|
| 3:13:01| some area we don't compete in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11581)|
| 3:13:03| To some degree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11583)|
| 3:13:05| that is the case with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11585)|
| 3:13:07| police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11587)|
| 3:13:09| We have one of the best academies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11589)|
| 3:13:11| and we do tend to lose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11591)|
| 3:13:13| employees to the FBI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11593)|
| 3:13:15| TBI| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11595)|
| 3:13:17| because they come here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11597)|
| 3:13:19| and get a really stellar level of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11599)|
| 3:13:21| training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11601)|
| 3:13:23| We simply can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11603)|
| 3:13:25| but the issue is we really can't compete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11605)|
| 3:13:27| with the salaries they're paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11607)|
| 3:13:29| It's not realistic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11609)|
| 3:13:31| We basically look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11611)|
| 3:13:33| what else can we do to incentivize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11613)|
| 3:13:35| our employees because it's never going to be on salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11615)|
| 3:13:37| alone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11617)|
| 3:13:39| Things like our educational incentive, our longevity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11619)|
| 3:13:41| our pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11621)|
| 3:13:43| Those are things we use to try to retain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11623)|
| 3:13:45| those employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11625)|
| 3:13:47| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11627)|
| 3:13:51| Council lunch is upstairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11631)|
| 3:13:53| where we normally meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11633)|
| 3:13:55| so we'll go up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11635)|
| 3:13:57| We're going to reconvene at 1.30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11637)|
| 3:13:59| The afternoon session to order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11639)|
| 3:14:01| Council take their seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11641)|
| 3:14:05| Mr. Pavlis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11645)|
| 3:14:07| and Ms. Palmer will be joining us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11647)|
| 3:14:09| They're running behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11649)|
| 3:14:11| Good afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11651)|
| 3:14:13| I want to welcome the new folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11653)|
| 3:14:17| Christy and Jim, we're going to start with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11657)|
| 3:14:19| It's 1.30 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11659)|
| 3:14:21| I guess we're starting with finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11661)|
| 3:14:23| We're on page 2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11663)|
| 3:14:31| I think you're fine right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11671)|
| 3:14:35| Finance budget basically is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11675)|
| 3:14:37| pretty much the same as it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11677)|
| 3:14:39| In FY16| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11679)|
| 3:14:41| we're up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11681)|
| 3:14:43| six-tenths of a percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11683)|
| 3:14:45| from last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11685)|
| 3:14:51| Salaries are up about two-tenths of a percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11691)|
| 3:14:55| Everything else is pretty much the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11695)|
| 3:14:59| A couple of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11699)|
| 3:15:01| changes that we want to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11701)|
| 3:15:05| Some things that you may or may not know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11705)|
| 3:15:08| Within finance budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11708)|
| 3:15:10| there's one item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11710)|
| 3:15:14| That's a payment to Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11714)|
| 3:15:16| It's budgeted at $130,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11716)|
| 3:15:18| The city is required to pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11718)|
| 3:15:20| the property assessor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11720)|
| 3:15:22| a portion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11722)|
| 3:15:24| personal property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11724)|
| 3:15:26| assessment costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11726)|
| 3:15:28| That's what that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11728)|
| 3:15:30| Whenever the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11730)|
| 3:15:32| property assessor goes out and works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11732)|
| 3:15:34| I think he actually contracts out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11734)|
| 3:15:36| personal property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11736)|
| 3:15:38| When he handles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11738)|
| 3:15:40| personal property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11740)|
| 3:15:42| taxes, he sends us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11742)|
| 3:15:44| a bill and that's what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11744)|
| 3:15:46| line is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11746)|
| 3:15:48| Another change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11748)|
| 3:15:50| Christy hit on it, but I'll just reiterate it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11750)|
| 3:15:52| We have money in there for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11752)|
| 3:15:54| Knoxville Entrepreneurial Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11754)|
| 3:15:56| $50,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11756)|
| 3:15:58| for the center and then $10,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11758)|
| 3:16:00| for the start-up day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11760)|
| 3:16:02| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11762)|
| 3:16:04| that's pretty much it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11764)|
| 3:16:06| for finance, but I'll answer any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11766)|
| 3:16:08| that you might have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11768)|
| 3:16:10| Jim, if we were looking at your magic budget, what page| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11770)|
| 3:16:12| would we be on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11772)|
| 3:16:14| You would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11774)|
| 3:16:16| in the part that says budget detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11776)|
| 3:16:18| page 5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11778)|
| 3:16:20| Page 5, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11780)|
| 3:16:26| These are the weights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11786)|
| 3:16:28| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11788)|

| 3:16:34| Yeah, but he has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11794)|
| 3:16:36| the details that he was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11796)|
| 3:16:40| Does anyone have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11800)|
| 3:16:42| to Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11802)|
| 3:16:46| Councilman Delavope, don't let us down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11806)|
| 3:16:48| Yes, ma'am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11808)|
| 3:16:50| Jim, do you see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11810)|
| 3:16:52| any dramatic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11812)|
| 3:16:54| changes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11814)|
| 3:16:56| software utilization or anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11816)|
| 3:16:58| that your department will be using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11818)|
| 3:17:00| that will make either your tasks easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11820)|
| 3:17:02| or the idea of single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11822)|
| 3:17:04| entry even if it's out in the fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11824)|
| 3:17:06| coming to you without having to double| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11826)|
| 3:17:08| handle it? I mean, you've already got a lot of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11828)|
| 3:17:10| but do you see any changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11830)|
| 3:17:12| over time with technology improving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11832)|
| 3:17:14| Again, we're always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11834)|
| 3:17:16| looking at ways to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11836)|
| 3:17:18| handle things from a technological| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11838)|
| 3:17:20| standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11840)|
| 3:17:22| I think we have a pretty lean staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11842)|
| 3:17:24| particularly when you compare us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11844)|
| 3:17:26| some of our comparable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11846)|
| 3:17:28| cities and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11848)|
| 3:17:30| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11850)|
| 3:17:32| we're always looking at those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11852)|
| 3:17:34| I think we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11854)|
| 3:17:36| pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11856)|
| 3:17:38| using most of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11858)|
| 3:17:40| available technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11860)|
| 3:17:42| Obviously, there are always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11862)|
| 3:17:44| things that we're looking to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11864)|
| 3:17:46| but in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11866)|
| 3:17:48| of banking and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11868)|
| 3:17:50| we're pretty much totally automated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11870)|
| 3:17:52| payroll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11872)|
| 3:17:54| again, fully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11874)|
| 3:17:56| automated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11876)|
| 3:17:58| budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11878)|
| 3:18:00| I would say that I wish we had some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11880)|
| 3:18:02| better systems in place but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11882)|
| 3:18:04| we've managed to work through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11884)|
| 3:18:06| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11886)|
| 3:18:08| but again, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11888)|
| 3:18:10| always looking at ways that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11890)|
| 3:18:12| advance from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11892)|
| 3:18:14| a technological standpoint. We're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11894)|
| 3:18:16| shaving pennies off of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11896)|
| 3:18:18| so for example, if you just take a look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11898)|
| 3:18:20| check transactions, the fewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11900)|
| 3:18:22| checks that we can process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11902)|
| 3:18:24| the better we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11904)|
| 3:18:26| because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11906)|
| 3:18:28| again, can we save| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11908)|
| 3:18:30| a half cent off that transaction?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11910)|
| 3:18:32| Those tend to add up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11912)|
| 3:18:34| Do you aggregate payments to vendors and stuff like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11914)|
| 3:18:36| We definitely aggregate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11916)|
| 3:18:38| payments to vendors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11918)|
| 3:18:40| we try and do them electronically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11920)|
| 3:18:42| where possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11922)|
| 3:18:44| again, that's one place we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11924)|
| 3:18:46| we're obviously looking at things where we may| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11926)|
| 3:18:48| end up contracting out that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11928)|
| 3:18:50| payment of service where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11930)|
| 3:18:52| transmit a file and let somebody else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11932)|
| 3:18:54| handle the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11934)|
| 3:18:56| so we're always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11936)|
| 3:18:58| open to things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11938)|
| 3:19:00| This other question I apologize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11940)|
| 3:19:02| I'm totally ignorant on and that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11942)|
| 3:19:04| what kind of management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11944)|
| 3:19:06| periodic management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11946)|
| 3:19:08| reports do you generate where you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11948)|
| 3:19:10| compare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11950)|
| 3:19:12| budget specific planned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11952)|
| 3:19:14| items to actual expenditures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11954)|
| 3:19:16| and where you are percentage wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11956)|
| 3:19:18| or dollar wise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11958)|
| 3:19:20| we don't get to see those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11960)|
| 3:19:22| is the management team getting that kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11962)|
| 3:19:24| information flow that helps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11964)|
| 3:19:26| them do their job better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11966)|
| 3:19:28| Most people honestly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11968)|
| 3:19:30| download it themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11970)|
| 3:19:32| it's available to department heads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11972)|
| 3:19:34| and they do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11974)|
| 3:19:36| in some cases we will generate reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11976)|
| 3:19:38| for them if they desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11978)|
| 3:19:40| we're always basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11980)|
| 3:19:42| looking at that to try and spot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11982)|
| 3:19:44| some issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11984)|
| 3:19:46| if we think there are some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11986)|
| 3:19:48| Historically accounting has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11988)|
| 3:19:50| somewhat of a count the beans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11990)|
| 3:19:52| after the fact and I didn't know how you were doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11992)|
| 3:19:54| with terms of up to the minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11994)|
| 3:19:56| information that tells the manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11996)|
| 3:19:58| we're doing something wrong here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=11998)|
| 3:20:00| we're getting something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12000)|
| 3:20:02| we're looking at those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12002)|
| 3:20:04| in some cases on a daily basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12004)|
| 3:20:06| to try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12006)|
| 3:20:08| to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12008)|
| 3:20:10| you're tracking it for them you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12010)|
| 3:20:12| if we see problems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12012)|
| 3:20:14| we will alert them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12014)|
| 3:20:16| talk to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12016)|
| 3:20:18| we think we put adequate controls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12018)|
| 3:20:20| in place to handle a lot of issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12020)|
| 3:20:22| is that where they get that two letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12022)|
| 3:20:24| email from you that says no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12024)|
| 3:20:26| is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12026)|
| 3:20:28| they pretty much know that that's the standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12028)|
| 3:20:30| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12030)|
| 3:20:32| just to add to what Jim's saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12032)|
| 3:20:34| there you will see that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12034)|
| 3:20:36| $25,000 allocated under budgeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12036)|
| 3:20:38| software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12038)|
| 3:20:41| because we do need new budgeting software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12041)|
| 3:20:43| and it is expensive so we're just kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12043)|
| 3:20:45| putting some money aside place marking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12045)|
| 3:20:47| that at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12047)|
| 3:20:49| but we will eventually have to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12049)|
| 3:20:51| and ask for funding for new budgeting software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12051)|
| 3:20:53| then we learned from Janet that when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12053)|
| 3:20:55| you do that then you have more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12055)|
| 3:20:57| software maintenance costs but obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12057)|
| 3:20:59| if you can make each worker more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12059)|
| 3:21:01| you're gaining ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12061)|
| 3:21:03| the budgeting software we have right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12063)|
| 3:21:05| is certainly not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12065)|
| 3:21:07| antiquated and it makes it a tougher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12067)|
| 3:21:09| job on all of them but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12069)|
| 3:21:11| they do a really good job of tracking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12071)|
| 3:21:13| everyone and making sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12073)|
| 3:21:15| that if we have an issue that they are recognizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12075)|
| 3:21:17| that they alert everyone to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12077)|
| 3:21:19| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12079)|
| 3:21:21| any other questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12081)|
| 3:21:23| on finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12083)|
| 3:21:25| in terms of health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12085)|
| 3:21:27| and really that should be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12087)|
| 3:21:29| we call it the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12089)|
| 3:21:31| health care fund it really should be health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12091)|
| 3:21:33| and benefits because there's a lot of other benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12093)|
| 3:21:35| that are included| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12095)|
| 3:21:37| within that fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12097)|
| 3:21:39| is this under finance or is this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12099)|

| 3:21:59| thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12119)|
| 3:22:01| ok| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12121)|
| 3:22:03| the budget for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12123)|
| 3:22:05| again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12125)|
| 3:22:07| health care and benefits employee relations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12127)|
| 3:22:09| type activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12129)|
| 3:22:11| is actually pretty large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12131)|
| 3:22:13| it's close to 21 million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12133)|
| 3:22:15| but it's actually down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12135)|
| 3:22:17| for the year by about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12137)|
| 3:22:19| 421| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12139)|
| 3:22:21| thousand dollars compared to last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12141)|
| 3:22:23| now a portion of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12143)|
| 3:22:25| is due to some fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12145)|
| 3:22:27| that went away with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12147)|
| 3:22:29| just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12149)|
| 3:22:31| in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12151)|
| 3:22:33| third year of the transition for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12153)|
| 3:22:35| Affordable Care Act and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12155)|
| 3:22:37| had two years the first year was the most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12157)|
| 3:22:39| expensive the third year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12159)|
| 3:22:41| is down we see that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12161)|
| 3:22:43| that's down and we're also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12163)|
| 3:22:45| again looking at better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12165)|
| 3:22:47| ways to control some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12167)|
| 3:22:49| of our costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12169)|
| 3:22:51| again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12171)|
| 3:22:53| when you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12173)|
| 3:22:55| at things within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12175)|
| 3:22:57| this we have a number of voluntary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12177)|
| 3:22:59| benefits that people take advantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12179)|
| 3:23:01| of those are paid for by the employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12181)|
| 3:23:03| that can include accident insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12183)|
| 3:23:05| critical care insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12185)|
| 3:23:07| supplemental life insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12187)|
| 3:23:11| cancer insurance and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12191)|
| 3:23:13| forth and then within the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12193)|
| 3:23:15| itself we have obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12195)|
| 3:23:17| our health care plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12197)|
| 3:23:19| we have vision care we have dental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12199)|
| 3:23:21| we have long term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12201)|
| 3:23:23| disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12203)|
| 3:23:25| we have basic life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12205)|
| 3:23:27| insurance and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12207)|
| 3:23:29| forth but those are all part of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12209)|
| 3:23:31| are they shared expenses employer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12211)|
| 3:23:33| employee or are they just employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12213)|
| 3:23:35| purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12215)|
| 3:23:37| some of the things are employee purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12217)|
| 3:23:39| so for example accident| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12219)|
| 3:23:41| insurance critical care insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12221)|
| 3:23:43| those are employee only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12223)|
| 3:23:45| obviously health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12225)|
| 3:23:47| is shared between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12227)|
| 3:23:49| employees and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12229)|
| 3:23:53| employer the rough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12233)|
| 3:23:55| rule as we see picks up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12235)|
| 3:23:57| about 70% employees pick up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12237)|
| 3:23:59| about 30% of those costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12239)|
| 3:24:03| dental insurance we pay a portion of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12243)|
| 3:24:05| some people choose to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12245)|
| 3:24:07| go above our basic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12247)|
| 3:24:09| coverage that we offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12249)|
| 3:24:11| and so they basically can buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12251)|
| 3:24:13| but that's paid entirely by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12253)|
| 3:24:15| employee the same thing with vision care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12255)|
| 3:24:17| we offer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12257)|
| 3:24:19| pretty good basic plan but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12259)|
| 3:24:21| some people again choose to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12261)|
| 3:24:23| buy up at their own cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12263)|
| 3:24:27| another thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12267)|
| 3:24:29| that's in here is our wellness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12269)|
| 3:24:31| clinic and a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12271)|
| 3:24:33| portion of our wellness clinic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12273)|
| 3:24:35| falls under this another portion falls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12275)|
| 3:24:37| under our risk the PT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12277)|
| 3:24:39| portion and again a portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12279)|
| 3:24:41| for workers comp but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12281)|
| 3:24:43| for employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12283)|
| 3:24:45| you know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12285)|
| 3:24:47| falls here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12287)|
| 3:24:49| Katie can probably address it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12289)|
| 3:24:51| even we're currently going out for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12291)|
| 3:24:53| proposals on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12293)|
| 3:24:55| that clinic we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12295)|
| 3:24:57| that that clinic again we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12297)|
| 3:24:59| trying to control our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12299)|
| 3:25:01| cost we think that the clinic actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12301)|
| 3:25:03| helps in that regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12303)|
| 3:25:05| and also provides an increased level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12305)|
| 3:25:07| of service for our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12307)|
| 3:25:09| because we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12309)|
| 3:25:11| get people in and take care of some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12311)|
| 3:25:13| of the acute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12313)|
| 3:25:15| acute care issues without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12315)|
| 3:25:17| them having to go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12317)|
| 3:25:19| a regular physician| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12319)|
| 3:25:21| which is typically more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12321)|
| 3:25:23| costly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12323)|
| 3:25:25| they might lose a day's work too whereas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12325)|
| 3:25:27| they might be able to go down and get treatment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12327)|
| 3:25:29| and come back to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12329)|
| 3:25:31| that's possible as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12331)|
| 3:25:33| one thing that again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12333)|
| 3:25:35| we say this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12335)|
| 3:25:37| and I still don't know that people realize it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12337)|
| 3:25:39| the city is self insured which means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12339)|
| 3:25:41| that we pay the premiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12341)|
| 3:25:43| so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12343)|
| 3:25:45| we're not like an insurer we do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12345)|
| 3:25:47| buy insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12347)|
| 3:25:49| you know where they take the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12349)|
| 3:25:51| the city takes the risk so we pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12351)|
| 3:25:53| all the costs we do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12353)|
| 3:25:55| Blue Cross Blue Shield as an administrator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12355)|
| 3:25:57| of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12357)|
| 3:25:59| we don't think we can do that ourselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12359)|
| 3:26:01| and we take advantage of the discounts that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12361)|
| 3:26:03| negotiate with physicians| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12363)|
| 3:26:05| and hospitals but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12365)|
| 3:26:07| the city is actually paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12367)|
| 3:26:09| those costs so again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12369)|
| 3:26:11| the better that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12371)|
| 3:26:13| more healthy we can have our employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12373)|
| 3:26:15| the better off our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12375)|
| 3:26:17| employees are and the better off it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12377)|
| 3:26:19| from a cost standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12379)|
| 3:26:21| because we are paying those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12381)|
| 3:26:23| does that help you avoid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12383)|
| 3:26:25| Blue Cross apparently is talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12385)|
| 3:26:27| a 36% increase next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12387)|
| 3:26:29| if they're just managing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12389)|
| 3:26:31| your money is it different than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12391)|
| 3:26:33| being in a pool that they take the risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12393)|
| 3:26:35| on yes it's definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12395)|
| 3:26:37| let me just give you an example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12397)|
| 3:26:39| people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12399)|
| 3:26:41| underwrite and an insurance company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12401)|
| 3:26:43| typically is going to underwrite about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12403)|
| 3:26:45| where they want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12405)|
| 3:26:47| what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12407)|
| 3:26:49| of their total premiums they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12409)|
| 3:26:51| want to cover about 70 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12411)|
| 3:26:53| 80%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12413)|
| 3:26:55| more likely 70%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12415)|
| 3:26:57| of their costs so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12417)|
| 3:26:59| out of their premium they expect to pay about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12419)|
| 3:27:01| 70% out of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12421)|
| 3:27:03| claims| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12423)|
| 3:27:05| so there is basically somewhat of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12425)|
| 3:27:07| markup| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12427)|
| 3:27:09| significant markup you might say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12429)|
| 3:27:11| we again run this like an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12431)|
| 3:27:13| insurance company but our underwriting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12433)|
| 3:27:15| is we write up around 99| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12435)|
| 3:27:17| to 100% so we're not trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12437)|
| 3:27:19| to get that gap we're trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12439)|
| 3:27:21| to adequately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12441)|
| 3:27:23| accurately estimate what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12443)|
| 3:27:25| our costs will be and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12445)|
| 3:27:27| self insurance is actually a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12447)|
| 3:27:29| better mechanism for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12449)|
| 3:27:31| and again we do contract out the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12451)|
| 3:27:33| management of it because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12453)|
| 3:27:35| we don't have that big a staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12455)|
| 3:27:37| to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12457)|
| 3:27:41| just keep in mind too we're going to be moving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12461)|
| 3:27:43| our wellness center into the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12463)|
| 3:27:45| works complex this last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12465)|
| 3:27:47| year we've had an interim location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12467)|
| 3:27:49| off of Walker Boulevard that we've paid rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12469)|
| 3:27:51| so we'll be losing that rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12471)|
| 3:27:53| payment thank goodness and then we'll be moving our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12473)|
| 3:27:55| facility into the public works complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12475)|
| 3:27:57| which makes it very convenient for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12477)|
| 3:27:59| those people who work out of Lorain Street as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12479)|
| 3:28:01| well so it does allow people to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12481)|
| 3:28:03| over there get treated or to get physical therapy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12483)|

| 3:28:31| Mr. Chairman if I could ask one more question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12511)|
| 3:28:33| that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12513)|
| 3:28:35| I'm going to forget it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12515)|
| 3:28:37| oh there is some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12517)|
| 3:28:39| I'm not sure I quite| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12519)|
| 3:28:41| understand it for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12521)|
| 3:28:43| retirees who are before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12523)|
| 3:28:45| they get to Medicare age| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12525)|
| 3:28:47| do you allow them to either buy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12527)|
| 3:28:49| or get some interim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12529)|
| 3:28:51| coverage or bridge coverage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12531)|
| 3:28:53| or whatever you want to call it before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12533)|
| 3:28:55| employees who retire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12535)|
| 3:28:57| you know from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12537)|
| 3:28:59| can buy the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12539)|
| 3:29:01| insurance again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12541)|
| 3:29:03| they pay roughly 60% of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12543)|
| 3:29:05| the premiums and the city pays 40%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12545)|
| 3:29:07| of the premiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12547)|
| 3:29:09| once you reach Medicare age then you're no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12549)|
| 3:29:11| eligible to purchase that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12551)|
| 3:29:13| we don't have that longer term risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12553)|
| 3:29:15| no you know again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12555)|
| 3:29:17| from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12557)|
| 3:29:19| what accountants call that is other post| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12559)|
| 3:29:21| employment benefits we do have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12561)|
| 3:29:23| a liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12563)|
| 3:29:25| just to give you some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12565)|
| 3:29:27| our total liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12567)|
| 3:29:29| and it's mostly manufacturers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12569)|
| 3:29:31| like 1.7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12571)|
| 3:29:33| Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12573)|
| 3:29:35| Memphis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12575)|
| 3:29:37| their long term OPEB liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12577)|
| 3:29:39| is over a billion dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12579)|
| 3:29:41| and that's billion with a B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12581)|
| 3:29:43| not million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12583)|
| 3:29:45| so in addition to like unfunded pensions they would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12585)|
| 3:29:47| unfunded health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12587)|
| 3:29:49| again probably for Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12589)|
| 3:29:51| probably for Memphis as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12591)|
| 3:29:53| their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12593)|
| 3:29:55| other post employment benefit liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12595)|
| 3:29:57| is probably bigger than the total pension liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12597)|
| 3:29:59| that's not an unusual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12599)|
| 3:30:01| case but again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12601)|
| 3:30:03| ours is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12603)|
| 3:30:05| around 1.7 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12605)|
| 3:30:07| and again most of that is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12607)|
| 3:30:09| an actuary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12609)|
| 3:30:11| is going to calculate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12611)|
| 3:30:13| imputed costs and because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12613)|
| 3:30:15| older individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12615)|
| 3:30:17| or people who have retired from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12617)|
| 3:30:19| you know are older| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12619)|
| 3:30:21| they typically have higher health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12621)|
| 3:30:23| costs than younger people and so we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12623)|
| 3:30:25| factor that in and that's really what that liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12625)|
| 3:30:27| is but we pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12627)|
| 3:30:29| that annually and again we pay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12629)|
| 3:30:31| roughly 60%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12631)|
| 3:30:33| of that and that's been steadily declining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12633)|
| 3:30:35| over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12635)|
| 3:30:37| the last few years I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12637)|
| 3:30:39| have around 200| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12639)|
| 3:30:41| covered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12641)|
| 3:30:43| 200 and some odd covered lives in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12643)|
| 3:30:45| OPEB liability that's close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12645)|
| 3:30:47| you got help on the way here it looks like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12647)|
| 3:30:49| I don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12649)|
| 3:30:51| about 140| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12651)|

| 3:31:17| cut and dried| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12677)|
| 3:31:19| salaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12679)|
| 3:31:21| and most of what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12681)|
| 3:31:23| in our operating budget is city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12683)|
| 3:31:25| wide software maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12685)|
| 3:31:27| and that's somewhat of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12687)|
| 3:31:29| pass through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12689)|
| 3:31:31| our budget increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12691)|
| 3:31:33| about 108| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12693)|
| 3:31:35| thousand dollars this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12695)|
| 3:31:37| primarily due to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12697)|
| 3:31:39| Acela work order system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12699)|

| 3:31:43| budget is 4.6 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12703)|
| 3:31:45| do you have any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12705)|
| 3:31:47| on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12707)|
| 3:31:49| any of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12709)|
| 3:31:53| page 3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12713)|
| 3:31:57| yes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12717)|
| 3:31:59| I was just going to ask Janet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12719)|
| 3:32:01| will there come a time when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12721)|
| 3:32:03| city council forum will be easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12723)|
| 3:32:05| to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12725)|
| 3:32:07| every once in a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12727)|
| 3:32:09| one of us starts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12729)|
| 3:32:11| by mail that I can't get on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12731)|
| 3:32:13| well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12733)|
| 3:32:15| that software is free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12735)|
| 3:32:17| so I guess you get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12737)|
| 3:32:19| what you pay for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12739)|
| 3:32:21| the price is right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12741)|
| 3:32:23| so yes we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12743)|
| 3:32:25| but council would have to budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12745)|
| 3:32:27| for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12747)|

| 3:33:19| so I for one really appreciate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12799)|

| 3:33:39| AVO or whatever you just described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12819)|
| 3:33:41| system going in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12821)|
| 3:33:43| you can write a ticket| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12823)|
| 3:33:45| and it goes straight to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12825)|
| 3:33:47| city court programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12827)|
| 3:33:49| and we have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12829)|
| 3:33:51| chase the vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12831)|
| 3:33:53| wherever they are kind of software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12833)|
| 3:33:55| that's called the AVL software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12835)|
| 3:33:57| that's the AVL| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12837)|
| 3:33:59| do you have any other initiatives coming on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12839)|
| 3:34:01| in the upcoming year or years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12841)|
| 3:34:03| there are several things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12843)|
| 3:34:05| that we're going to be working on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12845)|
| 3:34:07| there's one a fire station alerting system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12847)|
| 3:34:11| it actually integrates with 911| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12851)|
| 3:34:13| when they dispatch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12853)|
| 3:34:15| the fire trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12855)|
| 3:34:17| from a fire station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12857)|
| 3:34:19| it opens up the garage doors for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12859)|
| 3:34:21| turns on the lights and sets off alarms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12861)|
| 3:34:23| and does that kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12863)|
| 3:34:25| so that is something we'll be working toward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12865)|
| 3:34:27| there's an e-learning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12867)|
| 3:34:29| software package| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12869)|
| 3:34:31| that we'll be putting in for the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12871)|
| 3:34:33| as well so they can get their certifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12873)|
| 3:34:35| online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12875)|
| 3:34:37| this is the continuing education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12877)|
| 3:34:39| or level certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12879)|
| 3:34:41| as I understand it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12881)|
| 3:34:43| you'll have to ask Chief Sharp| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12883)|
| 3:34:45| they have to have certain certifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12885)|
| 3:34:47| every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12887)|
| 3:34:49| to move up and also to keep their certifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12889)|
| 3:34:53| and last but not least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12893)|
| 3:34:55| we'll be doing phase 2 of our work order system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12895)|
| 3:34:57| we'll be bringing in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12897)|
| 3:34:59| engineering and building inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12899)|
| 3:35:01| and then inventory for them as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12901)|
| 3:35:03| and probably some other things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12903)|
| 3:35:05| so the guy in the field can notice a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12905)|
| 3:35:07| and it will get into the system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12907)|
| 3:35:09| where the fixer guy knows about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12909)|
| 3:35:11| we're actually doing that right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12911)|
| 3:35:13| codes enforcement, they have iPads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12913)|
| 3:35:15| and they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12915)|
| 3:35:17| put their inspection results| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12917)|
| 3:35:19| into the iPad| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12919)|
| 3:35:21| and yes it goes back to the mothership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12921)|
| 3:35:23| so instead of waiting to get back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12923)|
| 3:35:25| to the office and you write something up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12925)|
| 3:35:27| and the piece of paper travels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12927)|
| 3:35:29| that's exactly how it works and I think it's made us a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12929)|
| 3:35:31| efficient that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12931)|
| 3:35:33| good, thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12933)|
| 3:35:35| any other questions council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12935)|
| 3:35:37| thank you very much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12937)|
| 3:35:39| I thought you were going to ask for e-training for seniors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12939)|
| 3:35:41| but you didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12941)|
| 3:35:43| next we'll have Russ Jensen come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12943)|
| 3:35:45| he is the manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12945)|
| 3:35:47| for 311| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12947)|
| 3:35:49| we're back on page 1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12949)|
| 3:35:51| good afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12951)|
| 3:35:53| Russ Jensen, 311| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12953)|
| 3:35:55| I just want to take a minute to echo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12955)|
| 3:35:57| what Janet was talking about with the new software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12957)|
| 3:35:59| Knoxville did it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12959)|
| 3:36:01| completely different than any other city in the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12961)|
| 3:36:03| in that we put that software directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12963)|
| 3:36:05| in the call center in 311| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12965)|
| 3:36:07| so we're not using a second piece of software| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12967)|
| 3:36:09| to put service requests in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12969)|
| 3:36:11| and then transfer it over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12971)|
| 3:36:13| we're literally putting it directly into the same system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12973)|
| 3:36:15| that codes enforcement, public service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12975)|
| 3:36:17| and everybody else is looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12977)|
| 3:36:19| it was a gamble but it has paid off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12979)|
| 3:36:21| in spades, we are so happy with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12981)|
| 3:36:23| we are much faster with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12983)|
| 3:36:25| data entry one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12985)|
| 3:36:27| sorry? data entry one time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12987)|
| 3:36:29| and then it goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12989)|
| 3:36:31| and it follows it for the life of that service request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12991)|
| 3:36:33| so we're very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12993)|
| 3:36:35| from the call center end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12995)|
| 3:36:37| the IT folks and Janet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12997)|
| 3:36:39| we're really pleased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=12999)|
| 3:36:41| we weren't sure how that was going to go two years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13001)|
| 3:36:43| our budget also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13003)|
| 3:36:45| is very cut and dry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13005)|
| 3:36:47| one thing we did change operationally this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13007)|
| 3:36:49| is we did have a successful implementation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13009)|
| 3:36:51| of 211| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13011)|
| 3:36:53| in the call center which is a partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13013)|
| 3:36:55| with CAC's office on aging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13015)|
| 3:36:57| in collaboration with the United Ways of East Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13017)|
| 3:36:59| we moved that over July 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13019)|
| 3:37:01| with the beginning of the fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13021)|
| 3:37:03| and I met with United Way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13023)|
| 3:37:05| folks yesterday and by all accounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13025)|
| 3:37:07| it's been very successful, they are very happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13027)|
| 3:37:09| we did a one year pilot so we're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13029)|
| 3:37:11| about what we're going to do going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13031)|
| 3:37:13| so with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13033)|
| 3:37:15| I will throw it to questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13035)|
| 3:37:17| did you expand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13037)|
| 3:37:19| your offices that much? I see where there's an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13039)|
| 3:37:21| increase in your rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13041)|
| 3:37:23| for your space?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13043)|
| 3:37:25| he is expanding his office, he hasn't arrived yet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13045)|
| 3:37:27| but I know he's anxiously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13047)|
| 3:37:29| we are moving down to the third floor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13049)|
| 3:37:31| we're moving down to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13051)|

| 3:37:37| any questions council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13057)|

| 3:37:45| 211, we've all lived with 311| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13065)|
| 3:37:47| and we send our constituents there all the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13067)|
| 3:37:49| but what happens on 211?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13069)|
| 3:37:51| to kind of define it, and as a matter of fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13071)|
| 3:37:53| if you go to this month's issue of city view| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13073)|
| 3:37:55| there's a one page ad that kind of divvies up 311 and 211| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13075)|
| 3:37:57| and really spells it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13077)|
| 3:37:59| kind of an elevator speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13079)|
| 3:38:01| 311 obviously is Knoxville's phone number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13081)|
| 3:38:03| and it's anything to do with city services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13083)|
| 3:38:05| 211 is more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13085)|
| 3:38:07| human service related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13087)|
| 3:38:09| United Way type agencies but they do not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13089)|
| 3:38:11| to be United Way agencies for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13091)|
| 3:38:13| answer the phone for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13093)|
| 3:38:15| so everything from Second Harvest Food Bank to the Red Cross| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13095)|
| 3:38:17| to Ladies of Charity to Interfaith Health Clinic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13097)|
| 3:38:19| you name it, people call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13099)|
| 3:38:21| that are in some form of crisis or need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13101)|
| 3:38:23| some form of help and we do information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13103)|
| 3:38:25| and referral for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13105)|
| 3:38:27| in preparation for that last year I had three of my people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13107)|
| 3:38:29| cross train in what's called AIRS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13109)|
| 3:38:31| A-I-R-S which is the Association of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13111)|
| 3:38:33| Information and Referral Services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13113)|
| 3:38:35| so we literally have the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13115)|
| 3:38:37| 311 people, 211 people, they can answer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13117)|
| 3:38:39| either phone. You call in with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13119)|
| 3:38:41| the problem and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13121)|
| 3:38:43| the 211 folks figure out how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13123)|
| 3:38:45| route it to the right person to handle it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13125)|
| 3:38:47| Yes, but unlike a city request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13127)|
| 3:38:49| instead of taking care of that information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13129)|
| 3:38:51| for them on one call, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13131)|
| 3:38:53| generally have them call a different agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13133)|
| 3:38:55| we are kind of like directory assistants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13135)|
| 3:38:57| but quite a lot more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13137)|
| 3:38:59| detail. Oh, you can only refer them, you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13139)|
| 3:39:01| actually transfer them? We do not do the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13141)|
| 3:39:03| for them, we refer them to the agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13143)|
| 3:39:05| that best suits their needs. Everything from food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13145)|
| 3:39:07| assistants, utility assistants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13147)|
| 3:39:09| people that are looking for gas money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13149)|
| 3:39:11| shelter, dental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13151)|
| 3:39:13| assistant was a big one this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13153)|
| 3:39:15| How many calls did you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13155)|
| 3:39:17| We are at close to 12,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13157)|
| 3:39:19| calls for the year which is significantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13159)|
| 3:39:21| less than 311| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13161)|
| 3:39:23| but those calls take about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13163)|
| 3:39:25| 7.5 minutes. One thing I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13165)|
| 3:39:27| like to report is when we took that over from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13167)|
| 3:39:29| Nashville last year, they were averaging 4.5 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13169)|
| 3:39:31| a call and 3 referrals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13171)|
| 3:39:33| per client. So they were giving each client| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13173)|
| 3:39:35| 3 different agencies that could help them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13175)|
| 3:39:37| In the time that we've had it, we've cut a minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13177)|
| 3:39:39| off that call time down to 3 minutes and 24| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13179)|
| 3:39:41| seconds and we're giving 4 referrals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13181)|
| 3:39:43| per call on average. So we're giving them more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13183)|
| 3:39:45| information in about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13185)|
| 3:39:47| 75% of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13187)|
| 3:39:49| And they've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13189)|
| 3:39:51| got really nice people talking to them because I'm very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13191)|
| 3:39:53| lucky up there. I'm surrounded by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13193)|
| 3:39:55| really nice people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13195)|
| 3:39:57| And this is not senior only, this is any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13197)|
| 3:39:59| person with a human| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13199)|
| 3:40:01| need problem that you've got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13201)|
| 3:40:03| refer them. And two of the things we're tracking that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13203)|
| 3:40:05| weren't tracking before we took it over were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13205)|
| 3:40:07| people 60 and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13207)|
| 3:40:09| and getting them hooked up with SNAP program which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13209)|
| 3:40:11| Senior Nutrition Assistance Program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13211)|
| 3:40:13| and people that have had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13213)|
| 3:40:15| military service. They weren't asking those questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13215)|
| 3:40:17| prior to us moving it back here to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13217)|
| 3:40:19| It had been being answered in Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13219)|
| 3:40:21| and there are a lot of services that are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13221)|
| 3:40:23| for veterans that they may or may not be aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13223)|
| 3:40:25| so by asking that question we're able to get them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13225)|
| 3:40:27| more referrals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13227)|
| 3:40:29| Most importantly though as we've done that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13229)|
| 3:40:31| call time on our 301 calls has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13231)|
| 3:40:33| remained exactly the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13233)|
| 3:40:35| so it hasn't had an adverse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13235)|
| 3:40:37| effect on our 301 call volume at all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13237)|
| 3:40:39| and it's not costing taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13239)|
| 3:40:41| money to do that. The United Way funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13241)|
| 3:40:43| that. Are you in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13243)|
| 3:40:45| any way involved in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13245)|
| 3:40:47| never ending dispute about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13247)|

| 3:40:53| Absolutely not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13253)|
| 3:40:57| Any other questions council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13257)|

| 3:42:03| operated on Sundays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13323)|
| 3:42:05| We were also able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13325)|
| 3:42:07| lengthen our service hours on all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13327)|

| 3:42:13| which was considerably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13333)|
| 3:42:15| lengthened from previous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13335)|
| 3:42:17| And we have seen a 40%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13337)|
| 3:42:19| increase in ridership on Sundays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13339)|
| 3:42:21| So what people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13341)|
| 3:42:23| were telling us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13343)|
| 3:42:25| has actually come true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13345)|
| 3:42:27| They really needed that ridership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13347)|
| 3:42:29| on Sundays. A lot of people work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13349)|
| 3:42:31| on Sundays and most of our ridership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13351)|

| 3:44:15| you want to do to and from the bus stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13455)|

| 3:44:19| And you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13459)|

| 3:45:19| outside of the downtown where more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13519)|
| 3:45:21| one bus route meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13521)|

| 3:45:25| Where's Kirkwood? Remind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13525)|

| 3:45:29| Kirkwood is the short street there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13529)|
| 3:45:31| That's where the Superstop is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13531)|
| 3:45:33| So they can take a bus to there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13533)|
| 3:45:35| and then get one to another quadrant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13535)|
| 3:45:37| that they want to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13537)|
| 3:45:39| Exactly. Three routes meet there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13539)|
| 3:45:41| I'll close by saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13541)|
| 3:45:43| that we are going to be celebrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13543)|

| 3:45:55| I had mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13555)|
| 3:45:57| in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13557)|
| 3:45:59| that it would be wonderful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13559)|
| 3:46:01| if we could find a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13561)|
| 3:46:03| to have a rush hour bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13563)|
| 3:46:05| that went from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13565)|
| 3:46:07| somewhere in East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13567)|
| 3:46:09| maybe the Transit Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13569)|
| 3:46:11| to Forks of the River| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13571)|
| 3:46:13| where there are good jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13573)|
| 3:46:15| It seems to me there are lots of folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13575)|
| 3:46:17| in the inner city that don't have cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13577)|
| 3:46:19| and would be blessed to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13579)|
| 3:46:21| access to higher paying jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13581)|
| 3:46:23| How is that going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13583)|
| 3:46:25| I know there were some efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13585)|
| 3:46:27| of maybe trying to get some employer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13587)|
| 3:46:29| meeting times with people and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13589)|
| 3:46:31| Where is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13591)|
| 3:46:33| Actually, our staff has worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13593)|
| 3:46:35| with the Chamber of Commerce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13595)|

| 3:46:41| He set up some meetings with some employers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13601)|
| 3:46:43| at Forks of the River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13603)|
| 3:46:45| We have a concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13605)|
| 3:46:47| and the employers there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13607)|
| 3:46:49| are considering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13609)|
| 3:46:51| That's really all I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13611)|
| 3:46:53| about that at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13613)|
| 3:46:55| I'm thinking like a 7 to 8 run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13615)|
| 3:46:57| or a 4 to 5 run kind of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13617)|
| 3:46:59| where you get to work and you do your job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13619)|
| 3:47:01| and then you come home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13621)|
| 3:47:03| It does seem like it would be well used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13623)|
| 3:47:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13625)|
| 3:47:07| We'll continue to pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13627)|
| 3:47:09| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13629)|

| 3:47:21| at forum time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13641)|
| 3:47:23| for folks complaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13643)|
| 3:47:25| about the change in service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13645)|
| 3:47:27| to Summit Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13647)|
| 3:47:29| They do have a regular hourly service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13649)|
| 3:47:31| but they're looking not at the part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13651)|
| 3:47:33| of the glass that's full but that we lost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13653)|
| 3:47:35| several 15 minute runs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13655)|
| 3:47:37| How is that working out in practice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13657)|
| 3:47:39| as opposed to the emotional response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13659)|
| 3:47:41| that we've lost something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13661)|
| 3:47:43| that we need to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13663)|
| 3:47:45| The trolley changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13665)|
| 3:47:47| have been a challenge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13667)|
| 3:47:49| because of all the detours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13669)|
| 3:47:51| I'll just be honest about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13671)|
| 3:47:53| A challenge to everyone who drives downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13673)|
| 3:47:55| But I rode the trolley down here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13675)|
| 3:47:57| and it was absolutely on time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13677)|
| 3:47:59| and our employees are telling us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13679)|
| 3:48:01| that it's working well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13681)|
| 3:48:07| Change is hard for everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13687)|
| 3:48:09| but honestly this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13689)|
| 3:48:11| covering a larger area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13691)|
| 3:48:13| with the same amount of resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13693)|
| 3:48:15| and we think from the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13695)|
| 3:48:17| that we are hearing particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13697)|
| 3:48:19| from Summit Towers that it is working well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13699)|
| 3:48:21| for them as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13701)|
| 3:48:23| They know the time that it's supposed to arrive there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13703)|
| 3:48:25| so that if they plan they can get an efficient bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13705)|
| 3:48:27| Exactly. Once an hour. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13707)|
| 3:48:29| And that's about what a million to service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13709)|
| 3:48:31| the free trolley system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13711)|
| 3:48:33| The budget? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13713)|
| 3:48:35| And just to add to that Councilman DellaVolpe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13715)|
| 3:48:37| while you did hear one or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13717)|
| 3:48:39| very vocal people come to City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13719)|
| 3:48:41| we've had lots of people from Summit Towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13721)|
| 3:48:43| who are very, very excited about the change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13723)|
| 3:48:45| because what the change has allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13725)|
| 3:48:47| is for them to have Saturday service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13727)|
| 3:48:49| Right. They get an extra day of service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13729)|
| 3:48:51| Exactly. And they were very, very happy about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13731)|
| 3:48:53| That's good to hear. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13733)|
| 3:48:55| Has there been any discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13735)|
| 3:48:57| about the trolleys that are going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13737)|
| 3:48:59| to University Commons being on the outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13739)|
| 3:49:01| instead of in the garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13741)|
| 3:49:03| Yes. Some of our folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13743)|
| 3:49:05| have met with the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13745)|
| 3:49:07| and we're working with them to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13747)|
| 3:49:09| Are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13749)|
| 3:49:11| We're working in about two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13751)|
| 3:49:13| with the property owner to discuss that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13753)|
| 3:49:15| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13755)|
| 3:49:17| Vice Mayor? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13757)|
| 3:49:19| I also want to comment on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13759)|
| 3:49:21| actually for Summit Towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13761)|
| 3:49:23| and for seniors there's a senior discount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13763)|
| 3:49:25| which I believe is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13765)|
| 3:49:27| 75 cents. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13767)|
| 3:49:29| On the regular buses, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13769)|
| 3:49:31| It's half price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13771)|
| 3:49:33| So they have for Summit Towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13773)|
| 3:49:35| they have additional regular bus service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13775)|
| 3:49:37| In addition to the trolley you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13777)|
| 3:49:39| In addition to the trolley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13779)|
| 3:49:41| because they have the weekend service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13781)|
| 3:49:43| But while we're on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13783)|
| 3:49:45| since you brought it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13785)|
| 3:49:47| could you touch on the rationale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13787)|
| 3:49:49| for that change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13789)|
| 3:49:51| at Summit Towers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13791)|
| 3:49:53| It's all about scheduling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13793)|
| 3:49:55| and we did an extensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13795)|
| 3:49:57| public input process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13797)|
| 3:49:59| Some of you I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13799)|
| 3:50:01| joined us for some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13801)|
| 3:50:03| trolley outreach meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13803)|
| 3:50:05| We also had an online survey| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13805)|
| 3:50:07| that we got more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13807)|
| 3:50:09| 500 responses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13809)|
| 3:50:11| And over several months of collecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13811)|
| 3:50:13| data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13813)|
| 3:50:15| we actually were answering the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13815)|
| 3:50:17| of what the community wanted the trolley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13817)|
| 3:50:19| service to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13819)|
| 3:50:21| Who it should serve, what areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13821)|
| 3:50:23| it should serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13823)|
| 3:50:25| And by reorganizing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13825)|
| 3:50:27| the way that the schedules worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13827)|
| 3:50:29| we were able to run the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13829)|
| 3:50:31| trolleys later on weekday evenings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13831)|
| 3:50:33| which was a primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13833)|
| 3:50:35| request from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13835)|
| 3:50:37| hotels and employers and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13837)|
| 3:50:39| people who work downtown and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13839)|
| 3:50:41| residents. It now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13841)|
| 3:50:43| runs until 8| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13843)|
| 3:50:45| on the weekdays| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13845)|
| 3:50:47| and 10 on Friday and Saturdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13847)|
| 3:50:49| And we were able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13849)|
| 3:50:51| to extend into the Old City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13851)|
| 3:50:53| which was another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13853)|
| 3:50:55| request. And also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13855)|
| 3:50:57| to shorten the routes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13857)|
| 3:50:59| so that they meet up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13859)|
| 3:51:01| in each individual route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13861)|
| 3:51:03| for a quicker trip. So we were able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13863)|
| 3:51:05| to stay within our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13865)|
| 3:51:07| and do more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13867)|
| 3:51:09| with less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13869)|
| 3:51:11| While you're up there, just for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13871)|
| 3:51:13| information for people, for the public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13873)|
| 3:51:15| what is the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13875)|
| 3:51:17| now for a round trip| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13877)|
| 3:51:19| fare and transfer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13879)|
| 3:51:21| On the regular route?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13881)|
| 3:51:23| The trolleys are free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13883)|
| 3:51:25| The regular route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13885)|
| 3:51:27| system is $1.50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13887)|
| 3:51:29| and there's a 20 cent transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13889)|
| 3:51:31| But that is half price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13891)|
| 3:51:33| for seniors, 65| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13893)|
| 3:51:35| and older, anyone with a Medicare card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13895)|
| 3:51:37| students K-12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13897)|
| 3:51:39| Okay, thank you for that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13899)|
| 3:51:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13901)|
| 3:51:43| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13903)|
| 3:51:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13905)|

| 3:52:09| answer whatever questions you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13929)|
| 3:52:11| Kim was in the doctor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13931)|
| 3:52:13| late yesterday afternoon and she's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13933)|
| 3:52:15| well. She sent me an email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13935)|
| 3:52:17| saying that. So I heard from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13937)|
| 3:52:19| her this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13939)|
| 3:52:21| We'll let Mary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13941)|
| 3:52:23| Good afternoon everyone. It's a pleasure to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13943)|
| 3:52:25| I'll be speaking to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13945)|
| 3:52:27| today on behalf of the Convention Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13947)|
| 3:52:29| the Civic Auditorium and Coliseum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13949)|
| 3:52:31| and Chihuly Park. As you know, on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13951)|
| 3:52:33| November 1, we were asked to step in an emergency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13953)|
| 3:52:35| order for the other two facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13955)|
| 3:52:37| and so we also did the budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13957)|
| 3:52:39| for the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13959)|
| 3:52:41| I always like to begin by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13961)|
| 3:52:43| sharing with you though where we plan to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13963)|
| 3:52:45| finish the current fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13965)|
| 3:52:47| We are very happy to report with the Convention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13967)|
| 3:52:49| Center that we plan to finish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13969)|
| 3:52:51| the year $85,000 better to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13971)|
| 3:52:53| our budget, so we're pleased to report that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13973)|
| 3:52:55| For the Civic Auditorium and Coliseum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13975)|
| 3:52:57| we'll call that the KCAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13977)|
| 3:52:59| we plan to beat budget by $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13979)|
| 3:53:01| and Chihuly Park is relatively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13981)|
| 3:53:03| flat to current year budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13983)|
| 3:53:05| The majority of those savings, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13985)|
| 3:53:07| is in the savings of labor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13987)|
| 3:53:09| from the merger of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13989)|
| 3:53:11| executive management teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13991)|
| 3:53:13| and so that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13993)|
| 3:53:15| the update as we stand right now. Things are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13995)|
| 3:53:17| going really well and we've got some really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13997)|
| 3:53:19| good teams in place and we're excited about the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=13999)|
| 3:53:21| As far as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14001)|
| 3:53:23| the future goes, next year's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14003)|
| 3:53:25| operating budget, we are asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14005)|
| 3:53:27| for less funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14007)|
| 3:53:29| For the Convention Center, we are asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14009)|
| 3:53:31| for $74,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14011)|
| 3:53:33| less in the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14013)|
| 3:53:35| fiscal year, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14015)|
| 3:53:37| $1,541,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14017)|
| 3:53:39| to $75,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14019)|
| 3:53:41| savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14021)|
| 3:53:43| At the KCAC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14023)|
| 3:53:45| we are asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14025)|
| 3:53:47| for $1,092,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14027)|
| 3:53:49| which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14029)|
| 3:53:51| a savings of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14031)|
| 3:53:53| $372,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14033)|
| 3:53:55| And then at Chihuly Park, we're asking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14035)|
| 3:53:57| for $847,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14037)|
| 3:53:59| which is a savings of $101,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14039)|
| 3:54:01| The majority of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14041)|
| 3:54:03| savings really are labor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14043)|
| 3:54:05| and hourly labor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14045)|
| 3:54:07| watching the overtime,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14047)|
| 3:54:09| and again, that executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14049)|
| 3:54:11| management team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14051)|
| 3:54:13| having one team over all three facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14053)|
| 3:54:15| versus having three separate executive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14055)|
| 3:54:17| teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14057)|
| 3:54:19| We're continuing to watch utilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14059)|
| 3:54:21| That's one of the things that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14061)|
| 3:54:23| drilling down on with the newer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14063)|
| 3:54:25| facilities and implementing some of the programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14065)|
| 3:54:27| that we've implemented at the Convention Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14067)|
| 3:54:29| to try to reduce our carbon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14069)|
| 3:54:31| footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14071)|
| 3:54:33| And for the record, you'll note that Mary's numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14073)|
| 3:54:35| actually match my numbers and not Jim's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14075)|
| 3:54:39| Do you have a comment, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14079)|
| 3:54:41| We do have one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14081)|
| 3:54:43| capital funding request to ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14083)|
| 3:54:45| We were going to let Jim answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14085)|
| 3:54:47| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14087)|
| 3:54:49| Go ahead, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14089)|
| 3:54:51| She clings to her delusion as his answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14091)|
| 3:54:53| No, Mary's numbers do match Christy's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14093)|
| 3:54:59| We do have one capital funding request for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14099)|
| 3:55:01| KCAC, and that is for $180,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14101)|
| 3:55:03| for a fall arrest system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14103)|
| 3:55:05| That's a system that assists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14105)|
| 3:55:07| basically our OTC union.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14107)|
| 3:55:09| Anyone who's rigging in that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14109)|
| 3:55:11| it's a safety system where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14111)|
| 3:55:13| can tie off, be harnessed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14113)|
| 3:55:15| and tie off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14115)|
| 3:55:17| One thing important to note about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14117)|
| 3:55:19| that system is that 80% of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14119)|
| 3:55:21| investment can be moved if you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14121)|
| 3:55:23| should decide to build a new facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14123)|
| 3:55:25| in the future, so the investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14125)|
| 3:55:27| can be moved. But from an OSHA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14127)|
| 3:55:29| standpoint, we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14129)|
| 3:55:31| think this needs to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14131)|
| 3:55:35| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14135)|
| 3:55:37| Mr. Dellavope, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14137)|
| 3:55:39| Have you lined up the sponsors for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14139)|
| 3:55:41| Haslam Arena yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14141)|
| 3:55:43| Well, that would not be my place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14143)|
| 3:55:45| but I certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14145)|
| 3:55:47| could...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14147)|
| 3:55:49| Where are we on that, Christy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14149)|
| 3:55:51| We keep offering to name it the Dellavope Arena| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14151)|
| 3:55:53| anytime you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14153)|
| 3:55:55| But it's a very small kind of model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14155)|
| 3:55:57| We can show you a big model you can do, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14157)|
| 3:55:59| We're working on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14159)|
| 3:56:01| Obviously, it's a priority, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14161)|
| 3:56:03| probably in the next, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14163)|
| 3:56:05| 30 days, we're going to be looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14165)|
| 3:56:07| and meeting with some consultants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14167)|
| 3:56:09| who can help guide us through the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14169)|
| 3:56:11| of looking at the different options for how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14171)|
| 3:56:13| finance something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14173)|
| 3:56:15| That includes the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14175)|
| 3:56:17| auditorium as a rehab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14177)|
| 3:56:19| As a renovation. It would be a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14179)|
| 3:56:21| arena based on the study that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14181)|
| 3:56:23| CSL did that you guys all heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14183)|
| 3:56:25| about, and then a renovation of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14185)|
| 3:56:27| existing auditorium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14187)|
| 3:56:29| I assume an arena would not pay for itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14189)|
| 3:56:31| but would be an attraction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14191)|
| 3:56:33| to downtown. Absolutely. I mean, just like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14193)|
| 3:56:35| everything else, the Convention Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14195)|
| 3:56:37| Chilhowee Park, Auditorium Coliseum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14197)|
| 3:56:39| those are all economic impact drivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14199)|
| 3:56:41| They're not expected to be self-sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14201)|
| 3:56:45| I don't have any problem with you calling it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14205)|
| 3:56:47| the Coca-Cola building, either, if you find them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14207)|
| 3:56:49| Mary, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14209)|
| 3:56:51| We need to move ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14211)|
| 3:56:55| Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14215)|
| 3:56:57| David Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14217)|
| 3:57:01| Thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14221)|
| 3:57:03| We're on page four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14223)|
| 3:57:09| Page four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14229)|
| 3:57:15| Good afternoon. Good to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14235)|
| 3:57:17| So, I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14237)|
| 3:57:19| before you a couple times in the last six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14239)|
| 3:57:21| And, obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14241)|
| 3:57:23| Public Works is a large department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14243)|
| 3:57:25| We've got great colleagues behind us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14245)|
| 3:57:27| I know you're going to hear from all five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14247)|
| 3:57:29| of the departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14249)|
| 3:57:31| Public Works incorporates over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14251)|
| 3:57:33| 500 employees, more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14253)|
| 3:57:35| 90 million in operating, so it's big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14255)|
| 3:57:37| I think the message to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14257)|
| 3:57:39| just from my level, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14259)|
| 3:57:41| my job is to help coordinate resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14261)|
| 3:57:43| make sure the team of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14263)|
| 3:57:45| employees that you're going to hear from today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14265)|
| 3:57:47| are thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14267)|
| 3:57:49| efficiency, thinking about our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14269)|
| 3:57:51| business processes in a way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14271)|
| 3:57:53| we can add more value, do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14273)|
| 3:57:55| more with the existing resources through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14275)|
| 3:57:57| technology, through the review of how we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14277)|
| 3:57:59| operate our business, and meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14279)|
| 3:58:01| the needs of our customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14281)|
| 3:58:03| We have more demands, as you know, as elected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14283)|
| 3:58:05| presidents, for greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14285)|
| 3:58:07| for resurfacing, for sidewalks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14287)|
| 3:58:09| for infrastructure repair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14289)|
| 3:58:11| So our job is to try to maximize what we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14291)|
| 3:58:13| with our existing resources and do it in a professional way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14293)|
| 3:58:17| Just a few of the major projects that we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14297)|
| 3:58:19| I know these have been hit on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14299)|
| 3:58:21| The Acela work order management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14301)|
| 3:58:23| Again, desiloing, removing the silos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14303)|

| 3:59:33| in the last six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14373)|
| 3:59:35| I do want you to know that Public Works is a large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14375)|

| 3:59:39| very much like Police and Fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14379)|
| 3:59:41| who are our colleagues, that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14381)|
| 3:59:43| out at all hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14383)|

| 3:59:47| It could be a wind event, weather event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14387)|

| 4:00:01| with who's going to be here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14401)|
| 4:00:03| I think Peter Ahrens is our first director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14403)|
| 4:00:05| to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14405)|
| 4:00:07| We'll jump into it unless you have questions for me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14407)|
| 4:00:09| specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14409)|
| 4:00:11| Why don't we wait until after we hear from the folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14411)|
| 4:00:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14413)|
| 4:00:15| It's page six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14415)|
| 4:00:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14417)|
| 4:00:19| Good afternoon. Peter Ahrens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14419)|
| 4:00:21| Director of Planning, Review, and Inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14421)|
| 4:00:23| It's been a busy year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14423)|
| 4:00:25| A couple of the highlights include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14425)|
| 4:00:27| implementing the new sign ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14427)|
| 4:00:29| That's gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14429)|
| 4:00:31| pretty smoothly, actually, and I think you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14431)|
| 4:00:33| see a lot of old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14433)|
| 4:00:35| abandoned signs that have been taken down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14435)|
| 4:00:37| as a result of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14437)|
| 4:00:39| I think the sign contractors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14439)|
| 4:00:41| are familiar with the new rules and regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14441)|
| 4:00:43| and it's going well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14443)|
| 4:00:45| We've added a new Deputy Director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14445)|
| 4:00:47| Deanne Bogus, who has actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14447)|
| 4:00:49| taken some certification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14449)|
| 4:00:51| tests right now, but we've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14451)|
| 4:00:53| a lot of increased activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14453)|
| 4:00:55| in the form districts, whether that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14455)|
| 4:00:57| South Waterfront or Cumberland Ave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14457)|
| 4:00:59| and then with the Bearden Mixed Use District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14459)|
| 4:01:01| coming up. Her primary goal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14461)|
| 4:01:03| is to, or her primary responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14463)|
| 4:01:05| is going to be to administer those form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14465)|
| 4:01:07| districts, and that's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14467)|
| 4:01:09| a benefit to the building community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14469)|
| 4:01:11| the developing communities, to have a single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14471)|
| 4:01:13| point of contact to work through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14473)|
| 4:01:15| that process. As you know, a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14475)|
| 4:01:17| municipalities don't have the form districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14477)|
| 4:01:19| It's something relatively new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14479)|
| 4:01:21| and it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14481)|
| 4:01:23| I guess it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14483)|
| 4:01:25| we're fortunate to have her to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14485)|
| 4:01:27| our developing community work through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14487)|
| 4:01:29| One of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14489)|
| 4:01:31| big changes you'll see on our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14491)|
| 4:01:33| budget request is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14493)|
| 4:01:35| it appears that we're asking for quite a bit more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14495)|
| 4:01:37| but the reality is we're just integrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14497)|
| 4:01:39| neighborhood codes into plan review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14499)|
| 4:01:41| and inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14501)|
| 4:01:43| We see it as an opportunity to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14503)|
| 4:01:45| communication and collaboration between those two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14505)|
| 4:01:47| areas. I've actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14507)|
| 4:01:49| started managing Robert Moyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14509)|
| 4:01:51| and the Neighborhood Codes group already,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14511)|
| 4:01:53| and we're seeing positive impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14513)|
| 4:01:55| there, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14515)|
| 4:01:57| we're not asking for any additional funding for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14517)|
| 4:01:59| that group, but that group is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14519)|
| 4:02:01| with us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14521)|
| 4:02:03| We have increased our permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14523)|
| 4:02:05| fees this past year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14525)|
| 4:02:07| and we didn't really hear any negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14527)|
| 4:02:09| comments back. I see that the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14529)|
| 4:02:11| is following suit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14531)|
| 4:02:13| but with the increased activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14533)|
| 4:02:15| in the developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14535)|
| 4:02:17| world, in conjunction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14537)|
| 4:02:19| with the increased fees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14539)|
| 4:02:21| our revenues are increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14541)|
| 4:02:23| quite a bit, and I think Jim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14543)|
| 4:02:25| is happy that our subsidies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14545)|
| 4:02:27| from the general fund are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14547)|
| 4:02:29| reduced for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14549)|
| 4:02:31| year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14551)|
| 4:02:33| We have a total operating budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14553)|
| 4:02:35| request of about $3.5 million, and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14555)|
| 4:02:37| got 45 employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14557)|
| 4:02:39| and I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14559)|
| 4:02:41| What is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14561)|
| 4:02:43| 918,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14563)|
| 4:02:45| What are we looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14565)|
| 4:02:47| What did you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14567)|
| 4:02:49| say your total is, Peter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14569)|
| 4:02:51| 3 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14571)|
| 4:02:53| It's 3.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14573)|
| 4:02:55| It's about 2.5 for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14575)|
| 4:02:57| what was traditionally plans review and inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14577)|
| 4:02:59| and then Neighborhood Codes is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14579)|
| 4:03:01| adding...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14581)|
| 4:03:03| Briefly, what was the thought on combining the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14583)|
| 4:03:05| two, combining Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14585)|
| 4:03:07| Codes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14587)|
| 4:03:09| Neighborhood Codes goes out. They integrate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14589)|
| 4:03:11| They have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14591)|
| 4:03:13| lot of overlap, a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14593)|
| 4:03:15| complaints overlap with zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14595)|
| 4:03:17| and a lot of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14597)|
| 4:03:19| that are not zoning result in building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14599)|
| 4:03:21| permits and plumbing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14601)|
| 4:03:23| gas mechanical permits, so when they go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14603)|
| 4:03:25| out and they find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14605)|

| 4:03:33| building inspectors so that we know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14613)|
| 4:03:35| what exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14615)|
| 4:03:37| is going on. This isn't a budget question, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14617)|
| 4:03:39| I guess we call you now for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14619)|

| 4:03:47| or Peter. Peter is now responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14627)|
| 4:03:49| Most municipalities don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14629)|
| 4:03:51| have a separation. That was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14631)|
| 4:03:53| I've had a little longevity here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14633)|
| 4:03:55| Over a decade ago, that was done because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14635)|
| 4:03:57| personalities. We just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14637)|
| 4:03:59| corrected it now. We just corrected it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14639)|
| 4:04:01| It needed to be back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14641)|

| 4:04:09| going to get a hold of him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14649)|
| 4:04:11| Go to Peter. Go to Chad and myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14651)|
| 4:04:13| We'll make sure that he gets inspected and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14653)|
| 4:04:15| if there's an issue, you get a response from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14655)|
| 4:04:17| Mr. Moyers. If he gets elevated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14657)|
| 4:04:19| Peter's going to be the person that makes those decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14659)|
| 4:04:21| just like he does on any other building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14661)|

| 4:04:33| That's an old light. You don't have a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14673)|
| 4:04:35| If I may,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14675)|
| 4:04:37| the 918,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14677)|
| 4:04:39| I think that he was referring to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14679)|
| 4:04:41| is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14681)|
| 4:04:43| codes enforcement piece| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14683)|
| 4:04:45| that was formerly under public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14685)|
| 4:04:47| service and it's now under inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14687)|
| 4:04:49| It's the one that moved. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14689)|
| 4:04:51| The Moyers group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14691)|
| 4:04:53| Peter, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14693)|

| 4:04:57| Thank you. When| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14697)|
| 4:04:59| the codes enforcement people are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14699)|
| 4:05:01| out, are they still doing their drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14701)|
| 4:05:03| through the neighborhood every week or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14703)|
| 4:05:05| Yes. Okay. When they see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14705)|
| 4:05:07| these flag type signs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14707)|
| 4:05:09| and things flapping in the wind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14709)|
| 4:05:11| do they report those or do those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14711)|
| 4:05:13| need to be reported separately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14713)|
| 4:05:15| I ask because we seem to be having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14715)|
| 4:05:17| an epidemic and I know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14717)|
| 4:05:19| a sign company is featuring a special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14719)|
| 4:05:21| on those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14721)|
| 4:05:23| If you see them, we're happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14723)|
| 4:05:25| to follow up. We are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14725)|
| 4:05:27| trying to get some more cooperation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14727)|
| 4:05:29| between the different divisions there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14729)|
| 4:05:31| Definitely call into 311| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14731)|
| 4:05:33| and we'll be on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14733)|
| 4:05:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14735)|
| 4:05:37| Dan. How many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14737)|
| 4:05:39| do you have now to actually go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14739)|
| 4:05:41| and inspect? How many inspectors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14741)|
| 4:05:43| do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14743)|
| 4:05:45| What type of inspectors are we asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14745)|
| 4:05:47| Codes. Codes? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14747)|
| 4:05:49| Twelve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14749)|
| 4:05:55| Mr. Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14755)|
| 4:05:57| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14757)|
| 4:05:59| I'm just wondering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14759)|
| 4:06:01| do you expect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14761)|
| 4:06:03| to have very much involvement with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14763)|
| 4:06:05| the food truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14765)|
| 4:06:07| rule enforcement or is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14767)|
| 4:06:09| going to be very occasional?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14769)|
| 4:06:11| We do get involved on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14771)|
| 4:06:13| We inspect them to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14773)|
| 4:06:15| that their life safety measures are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14775)|
| 4:06:17| in place and we also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14777)|
| 4:06:19| have the opportunity to go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14779)|
| 4:06:21| We coordinate with the fire department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14781)|
| 4:06:23| if they go out and they see something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14783)|
| 4:06:25| that looks out of place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14785)|
| 4:06:27| or dangerous, we definitely get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14787)|
| 4:06:29| And relay you to get involved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14789)|
| 4:06:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14791)|
| 4:06:33| But we don't regulate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14793)|
| 4:06:35| we issue permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14795)|
| 4:06:37| for private property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14797)|

| 4:06:41| permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14801)|
| 4:06:43| but we don't regulate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14803)|
| 4:06:45| on street, the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14805)|
| 4:06:47| on street designations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14807)|
| 4:06:49| Is that police who does that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14809)|
| 4:06:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14811)|
| 4:06:53| Do you have any kind of resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14813)|
| 4:06:55| where I guess the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14815)|
| 4:06:57| codes guys will go out and see a problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14817)|
| 4:06:59| but the homeowner may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14819)|
| 4:07:01| really know how to get it solved and where they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14821)|
| 4:07:03| get information of who they might contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14823)|
| 4:07:05| in private business or some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14825)|
| 4:07:07| list of people that do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14827)|
| 4:07:09| whatever they need done. Is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14829)|
| 4:07:11| any resource you help them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14831)|
| 4:07:13| get their problem solved so they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14833)|
| 4:07:15| have a continuing mess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14835)|
| 4:07:17| We don't give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14837)|
| 4:07:19| recommendations. We don't want to give the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14839)|
| 4:07:21| idea that we have favorites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14841)|
| 4:07:23| out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14843)|
| 4:07:25| I would imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14845)|
| 4:07:27| it sounds like 2-1-1 might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14847)|
| 4:07:29| an opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14849)|
| 4:07:31| Chamber of Commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14851)|
| 4:07:33| I would say though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14853)|
| 4:07:35| the inspector's job is to find a solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14855)|
| 4:07:37| and so we route people to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14857)|
| 4:07:39| CAC, we may route people to 2-1-1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14859)|
| 4:07:41| So you do help them get to the place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14861)|
| 4:07:43| where they might be 70 years old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14863)|
| 4:07:45| and not sure how to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14865)|
| 4:07:47| Our goal is when you think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14867)|
| 4:07:49| enforcement you think punitive but the first step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14869)|
| 4:07:51| in any process is communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14871)|
| 4:07:53| I think law enforcement would say that, the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14873)|
| 4:07:55| marshal's office, Peter is going to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14875)|
| 4:07:57| You want the cure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14877)|
| 4:07:59| Our goal is health and safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14879)|
| 4:08:01| and to obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14881)|
| 4:08:03| promote investment and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14883)|
| 4:08:05| disinvestment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14885)|
| 4:08:07| Their role is to be a problem solver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14887)|
| 4:08:09| Can they say you need to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14889)|
| 4:08:11| a blank plumbing company? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14891)|
| 4:08:13| We cannot get into that but we can help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14893)|
| 4:08:15| refer people to agencies if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14895)|
| 4:08:17| have issues or challenges that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14897)|
| 4:08:19| are social service based.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14899)|
| 4:08:21| Sometimes it's just advising someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14901)|
| 4:08:23| this is not your primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14903)|
| 4:08:25| structure, where you live, you'll have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14905)|
| 4:08:27| to get a general contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14907)|
| 4:08:29| You can look in the phone book or online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14909)|
| 4:08:31| You'll need to get a licensed professional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=14911)|

| 4:14:07| maybe they have to pay something or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15247)|
| 4:14:09| whatever, is it possible that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15249)|
| 4:14:11| can begin to look into this to see where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15251)|
| 4:14:13| can move it so much quicker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15253)|
| 4:14:15| Absolutely. It's all a matter of funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15255)|
| 4:14:17| and I think Councilman DellaVolpe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15257)|
| 4:14:19| you had an article in the shopper that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15259)|
| 4:14:21| talked about what the backlog is and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15261)|
| 4:14:23| value of that backlog. It just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15263)|
| 4:14:25| hasn't been a priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15265)|
| 4:14:27| in past administrations and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15267)|
| 4:14:29| of course it is now because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15269)|
| 4:14:31| people are using so many different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15271)|
| 4:14:33| alternative methods of transportation. A lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15273)|
| 4:14:35| people are out walking so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15275)|
| 4:14:37| are definitely behind. We would love to catch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15277)|
| 4:14:39| up. We're not as bad off as a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15279)|
| 4:14:41| of other places but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15281)|
| 4:14:43| do want to improve our sidewalk and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15283)|
| 4:14:45| infrastructure and so we can definitely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15285)|
| 4:14:47| consider options for how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15287)|
| 4:14:49| to speed that up and how to get more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15289)|
| 4:14:51| sidewalks installed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15291)|
| 4:14:53| So much of it just has to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15293)|
| 4:14:55| with obtaining the right of way and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15295)|
| 4:14:57| it's not only just going through that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15297)|
| 4:14:59| but then also the financial cost of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15299)|
| 4:15:01| actually getting the right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15301)|
| 4:15:03| It's always easier to build a new sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15303)|
| 4:15:05| somewhere than it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15305)|
| 4:15:07| to go back and put in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15307)|
| 4:15:09| sidewalk and that's what takes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15309)|
| 4:15:11| such a long time but we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15311)|
| 4:15:13| definitely open to that and we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15313)|
| 4:15:15| actually talked internally about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15315)|
| 4:15:17| a couple of different options of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15317)|
| 4:15:19| how to get more sidewalks installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15319)|
| 4:15:21| at a faster rate and we'll continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15321)|
| 4:15:23| to have that conversation and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15323)|
| 4:15:25| could possibly come back to council with some ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15325)|
| 4:15:27| I think it would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15327)|
| 4:15:29| I think that what you just hit on is the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15329)|
| 4:15:31| people are walking more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15331)|
| 4:15:33| biking more and we want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15333)|
| 4:15:35| to be a walkable city and so therefore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15335)|
| 4:15:37| we need the sidewalks but I think all of us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15337)|
| 4:15:39| understand also what it costs to build a sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15339)|
| 4:15:41| but if there's some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15341)|
| 4:15:43| way that that conversation can continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15343)|
| 4:15:45| to where we can find out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15345)|
| 4:15:47| possible ways or alternatives to build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15347)|
| 4:15:49| these sidewalks I think it would be very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15349)|
| 4:15:51| helpful because I think all of us hear this in our neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15351)|
| 4:15:53| in terms of what people want today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15353)|
| 4:15:55| We will continue that conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15355)|
| 4:15:57| I do think we'll come back with some ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15357)|
| 4:15:59| and then of course engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15359)|
| 4:16:01| has a very detailed matrix that you all are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15361)|
| 4:16:03| all familiar with to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15363)|
| 4:16:05| rate the sidewalks and those are the greatest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15365)|
| 4:16:07| need and when you look at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15367)|
| 4:16:09| you look at any sidewalk around here and it looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15369)|
| 4:16:11| like oh there can't be any sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15371)|
| 4:16:13| that's needed more than this one right here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15373)|
| 4:16:15| and you look at the list and you go oh wow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15375)|
| 4:16:17| there really are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15377)|
| 4:16:19| I think one thing too that would be important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15379)|
| 4:16:21| is to broaden the discussion just beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15381)|
| 4:16:23| the new sidewalks as we've heard a lot about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15383)|
| 4:16:25| new and there is a backlog and they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15385)|
| 4:16:27| exceedingly expensive. I think engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15387)|
| 4:16:29| too would be great to broaden the discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15389)|
| 4:16:31| about what we put into the existing system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15391)|
| 4:16:33| because it's not only about the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15393)|
| 4:16:35| but we also have to take care of what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15395)|
| 4:16:37| the existing liabilities we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15397)|
| 4:16:39| and challenges so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15399)|
| 4:16:41| we have a sidewalk safety program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15401)|
| 4:16:43| that we contract annually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15403)|
| 4:16:45| we just did a grinding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15405)|
| 4:16:47| contract downtown to take care of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15407)|
| 4:16:49| some ADA issues downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15409)|
| 4:16:51| some raised lips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15411)|
| 4:16:53| we also have a curb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15413)|
| 4:16:55| cut program and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15415)|
| 4:16:57| Tom Clabo who is our chief civil engineer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15417)|
| 4:16:59| who really manages those projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15419)|
| 4:17:01| we also have the public service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15421)|
| 4:17:03| work orders that are written annually both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15423)|
| 4:17:05| for mostly replacement but some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15425)|
| 4:17:07| small new sections so I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15427)|
| 4:17:09| need to broaden that discussion too to not only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15429)|
| 4:17:11| look at what the needs are from a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15431)|
| 4:17:13| perspective but also what we have to do with the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15433)|
| 4:17:15| infrastructure because every mile we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15435)|
| 4:17:17| add new has long term costs as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15437)|
| 4:17:19| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15439)|
| 4:17:23| Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15443)|

| 4:17:27| Going back to sidewalk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15447)|
| 4:17:29| Gerald Green indicated that if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15449)|
| 4:17:31| use like a means number about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15451)|
| 4:17:33| it costs for linear foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15453)|
| 4:17:35| that we use $350 as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15455)|
| 4:17:37| an average estimate for linear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15457)|
| 4:17:39| foot for adding sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15459)|
| 4:17:41| but he indicated that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15461)|
| 4:17:43| he thought in new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15463)|
| 4:17:45| subdivisions if the developer who was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15465)|
| 4:17:47| putting the curb and the gutter and all that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15467)|
| 4:17:49| in place that you could probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15469)|
| 4:17:51| add a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15471)|
| 4:17:53| linear foot for $100| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15473)|
| 4:17:55| a running foot there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15475)|
| 4:17:57| is there any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15477)|
| 4:17:59| effort in the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15479)|
| 4:18:01| review to indicate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15481)|
| 4:18:03| that sidewalk should be added or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15483)|
| 4:18:05| must be added or do we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15485)|
| 4:18:07| code changes to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15487)|
| 4:18:09| facilitate that in other words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15489)|
| 4:18:11| is that a fair responsibility for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15491)|
| 4:18:13| a developer of a large track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15493)|
| 4:18:15| to take on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15495)|
| 4:18:17| and how do we get that done if we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15497)|
| 4:18:19| not make new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil160517BudgetHearingWithPublicForum?start=15499)|
