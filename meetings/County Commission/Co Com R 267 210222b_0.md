| 0:09:54| Last year, we weren't able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| Plus, I didn't have enough employees at the time, so we're going to do whatever we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| to not ever let this happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=602)|

| 0:10:25| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| Mr. Stooksbury, it kind of pains me to have to do this, but that is the thing since the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=626)|
| 0:10:32| law was broken, but I use your market, I appreciate it, and I appreciate you being business in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=632)|
| 0:10:38| the 7th District, but having the violation, I make a motion that we either have the $1,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=638)|
| 0:10:46| fine or you can, you know, I make a motion for the $1,000 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=646)|
| 0:10:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=656)|
| 0:10:57| Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=657)|
| 0:10:59| Just a point of clarification, Commissioner Busser, that's above what's outlined as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=659)|
| 0:11:06| first offense item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| Is that what you wish to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| I thought that was what we normally did, was $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=669)|
| 0:11:12| You have to give the option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| Yeah, that first offense under the beer board rules, the first offense gives the violator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| a choice between either a 30-day suspension or a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| Okay, we'll do the $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| You have to give the applicant a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=688)|
| 0:11:29| So, Ms. Stooksbury.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| I would do the $500 fine, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=691)|
| 0:11:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=694)|
| 0:11:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=695)|
| 0:11:36| So, if you could restate the motion, Commissioner Busser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| I believe our, historically, this body on first offenses has been a $1,000 fine or 30-day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=702)|
| 0:11:50| suspension of the beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| I'm just reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| That is our prerogative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=715)|
| 0:11:56| Yeah, it's the prerogative of any commissioner to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| I'm just reading what is outlined in our, as a guideline, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=720)|
| 0:12:05| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=725)|
| 0:12:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| When this was first done, we had the $5,000, $1,500, and we, for some reason, we set a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=727)|
| 0:12:14| precedence back some time ago that it was $1,000, and that's what we normally did as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=734)|
| 0:12:22| a body, even though what is written down there, but the precedence was set for $1,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=742)|
| 0:12:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=747)|
| 0:12:28| You can make, if you'd like to make that motion, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=748)|
| 0:12:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| As we've done in the past, and we've done all the others, it's $1,000 for a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=752)|
| 0:12:38| I'll make the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=760)|

| 0:58:05| Our first speaker is Julie Gautreaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3485)|
| 0:58:08| Are you with us, Julie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3488)|

| 0:58:33| I think if Mr. Lutton and Mr. Hammond, who are both Knox County employees, want to hold their comments until the end, until that item comes up, then I think that would be more than appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3513)|
| 0:58:44| But given that I'm not sure what everybody's timeline is for other speakers, I'd go ahead with the public if those two gentlemen would hold tight for that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3524)|
| 0:58:56| Because I imagine some of the questions will be more pointed towards that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3536)|

| 1:00:22| But I want to make the commission and the public aware of some local history around this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3622)|
| 1:00:29| I've been a public defender for 30 years, and I remember when the Roger D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3629)|

| 1:00:37| It was designed for in-person visitation for prisoners and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| Millions of county dollars were spent on its construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| In 2014, Sheriff Jones proposed a contract with Securus Technologies to install video visitation and other tech services, and that made sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3645)|
| 1:00:55| Times are changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3655)|
| 1:00:57| As technology presents new methods of communication, it's a great option for folks who can't visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3657)|
| 1:01:04| But after the commission approved that contract, the sheriff eliminated the in-person option that the Roger D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3664)|
| 1:01:11| Williams facility was designed for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3671)|
| 1:01:14| Every so-called security-based justification for this policy has been debunked by their own records that were obtained via open records in 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3674)|
| 1:01:24| The reason for the termination of in-person was financial incentive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| Incarcerated people or their families have to pay for remote visitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3688)|
| 1:01:33| The tech was installed at no cost to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| The sheriff didn't have the hassle of staffing on-site visitation, and the county got a 50% commission off the monies being paid to Securus by the families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3696)|
| 1:01:47| Now Sheriff Spangler has presented a deal with ICS with an even better percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3707)|
| 1:01:52| I understand it's 88%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| ICS can afford it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| Their parent company, the Keefe Group, made billions of dollars off prison commissary deals where people are charged up to $4 for a packet of beef jerky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3717)|
| 1:02:08| When people are in jail, their families, most of them poor, will scrape together what they have to make life more comfortable for their incarcerated loved ones, even when they know they're getting fleeced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3728)|
| 1:02:20| The Keefe Group is managed by HIG Capital, a private equity firm that recognizes how much money can be made off people who are trapped and their families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3740)|
| 1:02:30| It's a predatory enterprise worth billions of dollars to people with no connection to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3750)|
| 1:02:36| If you think this moral compromise is okay because the people being exploited are, quote, just inmates, please remember the vast majority of people in local custody are pretrial, not convicted of anything, and those who are are misdemeanor offenders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3756)|
| 1:02:53| Your 88% will be coming off the backs of struggling Knox County families spending the pennies they have to stay in contact with their loved ones in jail during some of the most difficult times since the Great Depression.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3773)|
| 1:03:07| I'm realistic about the fact that tech is here, but other states and jurisdictions, even in conservative states like Texas, have made laws that require the option of in-person visitation where video technology has been adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3787)|
| 1:03:21| I hope some of you will visit the detention facility one day, have a look at the tens of thousands of unused square feet that were laid out specifically for on-site visitation in 1992, perhaps before your next review of a contract like this, or before the construction of expensive new space for remote courtrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3801)|

| 1:05:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3940)|
| 1:05:42| My name is Kimberly Alicia Osori.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3942)|
| 1:05:45| I reside in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| I am speaking tonight on behalf of a personal experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3949)|
| 1:05:55| I had a child in custody, which was a very lengthy custody battle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3955)|
| 1:06:02| It was very difficult at times for me to be able to see my son and speak with my son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3962)|
| 1:06:10| At court was the time that I was able to unite with my son, and we could hug, and he could see who was supporting him, his sister, his older siblings were there, his sister and his older brother and myself, and my attorney, Margaret Held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3970)|
| 1:06:30| She fought for my kids, and I do have him back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| She's amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3994)|
| 1:06:36| Anyway, I was not able to see and talk to my son a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=3996)|
| 1:06:42| If it had not been for the court system, I would not have been able to see my son, which would have been very devastating on my end and devastating on his end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4002)|
| 1:06:54| He needed that support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| Isolation is horrible on all of us, and especially children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4017)|
| 1:07:05| That was a very difficult time in my life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4025)|
| 1:07:08| That was even prior to COVID, with it being very difficult for me to have contact with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4028)|
| 1:07:15| He needed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| We were able to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4038)|
| 1:07:20| You can't interact with your attorneys and be on a TV screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4040)|
| 1:07:27| Nothing replaces human contact and me being able to personally see my child versus on a screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4047)|
| 1:07:36| I just truly believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| Like someone else said, they're not convicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4060)|
| 1:07:43| They're just in there at the moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4063)|
| 1:07:47| My thing is I'm asking that you, unless there is major reasons of a child that can't speak due to the person that hurt them, can't speak with the person in the room, other than something of that sort, I am asking that you continue to let the children and the family unite together in a courtroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4067)|
| 1:08:15| I think it's very important for the child and the family, just for the child to see there are people rooting for them and there are people that love them and care and want them to get better, which can't be done if there's no human contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4095)|
| 1:08:31| That's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| Margaret did get my son back inside the family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4114)|
| 1:08:39| She did an amazing job with all three of my cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4119)|
| 1:08:43| But a lot went on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4123)|
| 1:08:45| But I would have been devastated and so would my child if I had not been able to see him in court and hug him and just let him know I'm his mom and I love him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4125)|
| 1:08:56| And I got his back, but it took a while, but there's people fighting for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4136)|
| 1:09:03| Thank you, Ms. Estrey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| I appreciate you joining us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4145)|

| 1:09:13| Or excuse me, Sarah McDonald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| Sarah McDonald, are you with us this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4155)|

| 1:09:32| Commissioner, she's going to have a phone number as her name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4172)|
| 1:09:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| Ms. McDonald, if you would please turn your mic on, if you can hear us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4178)|
| 1:09:46| And your screen on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4186)|
| 1:09:51| I just got a note that Margaret held is ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4191)|
| 1:09:54| So, Ms. Held, I'll go back to you first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| If you would turn your screen on and everything else off except for your mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4197)|
| 1:10:03| Ms. Held, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4203)|
| 1:10:07| Is there anyone with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4207)|
| 1:10:11| I am here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| Okay, there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| I can hear you, Ms. Held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4214)|
| 1:10:15| And can I see you as well, perhaps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4215)|
| 1:10:18| Yes, I'm trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4218)|
| 1:10:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4222)|
| 1:10:25| I was very concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4225)|
| 1:10:29| There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4229)|
| 1:10:31| Sorry, guys, I'm still learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4231)|
| 1:10:33| No problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4233)|
| 1:10:35| If you would please give your name and your county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| And you have five minutes to address commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4237)|
| 1:10:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4239)|
| 1:10:40| My name is Margaret held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4240)|
| 1:10:43| I am a lifelong resident of Knox County, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4243)|
| 1:10:47| I'm in Carson's district specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| And I'm here to talk to you today about the proposed $1.5 million allocated for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4250)|
| 1:10:56| video conferencing center for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| It is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4259)|
| 1:11:02| I am a civil rights attorney, among other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4262)|
| 1:11:05| I do mostly family law, but I also do civil rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4265)|
| 1:11:08| And I also am a county taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| And I would rather save my county taxes than sue the county as a civil rights attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4272)|
| 1:11:18| And I do believe that this proposal is going to cost the county quite a bit of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4278)|
| 1:11:24| Because I do believe that it violates several state statutes and the 6th, 5th, and 14th amendments of the U.S. Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4284)|
| 1:11:34| I only have five minutes, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4294)|
| 1:11:36| So I can't go into it too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4296)|
| 1:11:38| I would love questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4298)|
| 1:11:40| The crux of this requires us to make sure that criminal defendants are able to face their accusers face-to-face in the same room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4300)|
| 1:11:51| Unless there is a compelling state interest that is specific to this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4311)|
| 1:11:57| It can't just be a broad state interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4317)|
| 1:12:00| There has to be an interest in this case that says under this case it would be permissible to deprive them of being in the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4320)|
| 1:12:09| It has to be a case-by-case specific finding after an evidentiary hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4329)|
| 1:12:16| In other words, just saying, hey, this is going to save money and judges like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| And it's going to decrease the opportunity for car accidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4340)|
| 1:12:25| That's not good enough to satisfy the requirement for a face-to-face confrontation of the accused and the witnesses against them under the 6th amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4345)|
| 1:12:33| You're going to get sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| And we have suspended certain things, but this is such an important right of criminal defendants that the Tennessee Supreme Court had to suspend three separate criminal statutes during the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4355)|
| 1:12:49| When the pandemic is over, those three procedural requirements go back into effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4369)|
| 1:12:55| In fact, they will be back into effect under current Supreme Court orders by April 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4375)|
| 1:13:01| You guys are setting us up for expensive and protracted lawsuits by civil rights lawyers, myself included.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4381)|
| 1:13:09| I'll sue you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4389)|
| 1:13:11| And I'm not saying that to be a threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4391)|
| 1:13:13| I'd rather just save the money and get it right in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| There's also significant Fifth Amendment problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| That's the Equal Protection Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| There have been numerous studies, including studies by the Pew Institute, over the effects of the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4403)|
| 1:13:30| The average bond is 55 to 90% higher for video conferencing than for face-to-face conferencing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4410)|
| 1:13:40| This impacts people the most who are least able to afford it, who are poor people, who in Knoxville are disproportionately black, which also brings up the 14th amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4420)|
| 1:13:51| So now I get to see you on the 5th, the 6th, the 14th, and under three state statutes that y'all would have to violate just to use this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4431)|
| 1:14:02| And you're going to get sued, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4442)|
| 1:14:06| I just want you all to avoid this train wreck before it happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4446)|
| 1:14:10| The second thing, and, again, I love questions about this, is this so-called funding out of surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4450)|
| 1:14:15| If you will take a look at your budget, you will see that the county in 2020 actually has $2 million less in revenue than it did in the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4455)|
| 1:14:26| Take that drop in revenue, right, and if we just fund everything at current levels, we have a $2 million deficit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4466)|
| 1:14:35| But to find a $1.5 million surplus on top of that, you had to cut existing programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4475)|
| 1:14:42| $3.5 million is the deficit that we have, not $1.5 million surplus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4482)|
| 1:14:50| What you have is a $2 million shortfall in revenue plus $1.5 million cuts in existing funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4490)|
| 1:14:58| This includes funding for projects that are in existence, like the Family Justice Center, which is completely defunded under the current county budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4498)|
| 1:15:07| The Family Justice Center serves my clients, victims of domestic violence, okay, totally defunded under this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4507)|
| 1:15:16| For what? So that we can have better TVs to do court proceedings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4516)|
| 1:15:22| Which brings me to my third point. We have video conferencing capabilities right here, right now to do what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4522)|
| 1:15:31| What they're asking for is better, bigger, brighter, prettier TVs in a nice facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4531)|
| 1:15:36| To do that, they're defunding existing programs, claiming a surplus that does not exist, and putting this county at risk of multiple violations of state statutes and the federal constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4536)|
| 1:15:49| On every level, this is a poor plan. Feel free to call me, and I'll give you the details. I've got a written report on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=4549)|

| 1:36:59| So if you would please call the vote, or excuse me, call the caption, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5819)|
| 1:37:04| Okay, I'll be reading the caption from the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5824)|
| 1:37:07| the revised caption, other than what's printed on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5827)|
| 1:37:11| It is the resolution approving construction of a video courtroom facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5831)|
| 1:37:15| at 5001 Maloneyville Road at a cost not to exceed $1.5 million and approving a contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5835)|
| 1:37:23| with Shelton General Contractors for said purpose to be funded through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5843)|
| 1:37:27| an estimation and appropriation resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5847)|
| 1:37:33| Is this a revised caption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5853)|
| 1:37:37| That's the revised caption. I read it from the resolution and not the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5857)|
| 1:37:42| Okay, from the resolution. Okay. Sorry, I didn't see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5862)|
| 1:37:46| Okay, I'll start with a motion to open up discussion, a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5866)|
| 1:37:51| Is there a motion on item number 25?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5871)|
| 1:37:56| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5878)|
| 1:38:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5882)|
| 1:38:03| Second by Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5883)|
| 1:38:05| Okay, that gets us to a discussion point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| I'm going to first call on public defender, Mr. Eric Lutton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5888)|
| 1:38:12| I'm going to provide you five minutes to address commission, sir,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5892)|
| 1:38:16| if we can have that timer back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| Although we may have comments and questions, I'm going to give you both,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| you and Mr. Hammond, five minutes each as we did in public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5902)|
| 1:38:28| So Mr. Lutton, if you would please state your name and your department in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5908)|
| 1:38:32| and you have five minutes to address commission, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| My name is Eric Lutton. I'm the Knox County public defender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5915)|
| 1:38:38| I largely kind of presented my issues last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5918)|
| 1:38:42| I wanted to sign up to speak again this week for a couple of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5922)|
| 1:38:46| One, I was asked a question last Tuesday when I spoke by one of the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5926)|
| 1:38:53| about whether or not I agreed with the $100,000 savings number that it would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5933)|
| 1:38:58| that this proposed facility would supposedly save the taxpayers each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5938)|
| 1:39:03| And at that time, I had not heard that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5943)|
| 1:39:05| That was the, you know, I was learning that for the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| And so I was not able to intelligently speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| And since I had been asked that question, I wanted to try and look into that a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5950)|
| 1:39:14| so I could provide an answer from a perspective of someone who's working in the court system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5954)|
| 1:39:19| And I think that that number, if the information I've gotten is correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5959)|
| 1:39:23| then I would dispute that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5963)|
| 1:39:25| What I have been told by a third party where that number is coming from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5965)|
| 1:39:30| is that currently the sheriff's department spends about $135,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5970)|
| 1:39:35| in fuel costs in their transportation division.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| And that the estimate is that roughly 65 to 70% of those fuel costs that are spent each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5977)|
| 1:39:44| are for transportation of inmates back and forth from the Roger E. Wilson Detention Facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| and the city county building, which does come out to about $100,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5988)|
| 1:39:53| But I think it's important to note, as this is looked at from a financial perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5993)|
| 1:39:59| that this facility being built would not mean that individuals would not be going to court anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| It doesn't cut the transportation costs from everybody going all the way down to nobody going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6004)|
| 1:40:09| It would, under Rule 43, would potentially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6009)|
| 1:40:13| result in some additional arraignments being conducted out of the detention facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6013)|
| 1:40:19| And then, of course, if there was a change in Rule 43, which I know was mentioned as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6019)|
| 1:40:23| possibility that some people are moving for that at a statewide level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| However, if that rule were to be changed, we, one, would have no idea what it would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| But two, under the Tennessee Constitution, there's only so much they could tweak the rule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6033)|
| 1:40:38| because there's plenty of case law on point about the individual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6038)|
| 1:40:42| about the fact that somebody has a right to confront their accuser face-to-face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6042)|
| 1:40:47| So I think any time you were having any sort of a hearing where witnesses were present,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| there's no way to modify the rule where that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| So I still think that you're talking about the vast majority of individuals would still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6053)|
| 1:40:57| be being transported. And so I think that if the information that I've gotten is accurate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6057)|
| 1:41:02| then I think that $100,000 number would be significantly, significantly smaller than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6062)|
| 1:41:09| The only other thing that I wanted to speak to, I had gotten a question from a commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6069)|
| 1:41:14| that perhaps I did not do a very good job of explaining something last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| And so I wanted to talk about how there is sometimes a benefit to the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6078)|
| 1:41:25| that individuals are brought to court, specifically on those low-level misdemeanors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6085)|
| 1:41:30| Basically, what happens, like, let's say that you have somebody arrested for public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6090)|
| 1:41:33| intoxication on Saturday night, and the magistrate decides not to release them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| That individual, as it would stand outside of COVID times, would be brought to misdemeanor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6097)|
| 1:41:44| court for their arraignment, typically on that Monday in court, where a plea offer would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6104)|
| 1:41:49| presented, and they would have the option to typically accept a time-served offer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6109)|
| 1:41:53| which gets them out of custody. If they were to modify Rule 43 to allow pleas to take place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6113)|
| 1:41:59| I'm sorry, as it currently stands, you cannot take pleas remotely, except for under the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6119)|
| 1:42:07| current Supreme Court COVID order. That's the only reason we're able to take pleas remotely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6127)|
| 1:42:09| currently. So what I think would end up happening is you'd have this very large number of category| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6129)|
| 1:42:15| of clients that are charged with low-level misdemeanors that are getting out when they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6135)|
| 1:42:19| having their initial appearance in court, or rather their arraignment in court, that if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6139)|
| 1:42:23| were to not transport those individuals, what happens is you don't transport a Monday, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6143)|
| 1:42:28| then you're going to have to transport them Tuesday or Wednesday, and the taxpayers are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6148)|
| 1:42:31| going to eat that $77 a day that they're going to sit in custody for longer. And so you've not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6151)|
| 1:42:38| eliminated the transportation. You have just moved it a day or two. And those were the issues that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6158)|
| 1:42:44| wanted to speak. I wanted to try and answer the question that was posed to me last week and try| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6164)|
| 1:42:48| and provide a better explanation of what I was trying to say last week on the misdemeanor pleas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| but then also wanted to make myself available in case anyone had any questions for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6172)|
| 1:42:58| CHAIR BAILET Thank you, Mr. Lutton. If you'll kind of hang in the on-deck circle here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| if there are questions, we will get to those. Well, we could actually, if there's any questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6182)|
| 1:43:08| for Mr. Lutton, we could actually address those now. I think he'll stay with us through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6188)|
| 1:43:12| conversation, but is there any questions immediately from any commissioners before I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| go to Mr. Hammond? I'm not seeing any hands up, so hang with us, Mr. Lutton. And Mr. Hammond,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6197)|
| 1:43:26| if you would please state your name and your department, and you have five minutes to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6206)|
| 1:43:30| commission. MR. HAMMOND Thank you. I'm Mike Hammond, Knox County Criminal Court Clerk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6210)|
| 1:43:33| 400 Main Street, number 149. I've made some notes. I'm going to be referring to my notes here as I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6213)|
| 1:43:39| give you some information. As you know, I sent you an email last week which outlined a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6219)|
| 1:43:45| things, and I don't want to go into all of that again because I'm sure that you have read that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6225)|
| 1:43:49| and you kind of have a good feel for what we were trying to portray to you in terms of numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6229)|
| 1:43:55| both for juvenile, for the magistrates, what is happening in some other states and what is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6235)|
| 1:44:00| going on in Chattanooga. They already have a video courtroom for each of their criminal divisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6240)|
| 1:44:05| and they've had it even before the pandemic. But I would like to call attention to one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6245)|
| 1:44:10| things that was in that email, and that is from the Supreme Court rule on February 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6250)|
| 1:44:17| 21, which paragraph 7, which said, judges are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| court constitutional functions and rights are protected. Now, having a video courtroom is not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6262)|
| 1:44:27| going to change that. It is up to the judges to make sure that the rights are protected, and today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6267)|
| 1:44:35| sent you an email from the three criminal judges and the five General Sessions judges. They all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6275)|
| 1:44:42| signed it, and I would call your attention to a couple of paragraphs there which I think are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6282)|
| 1:44:46| extremely important. They go to say that there are certain types of court appearances that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6286)|
| 1:44:51| always require that the defendant appear in the courtroom in person. Yes, you do have a right to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6291)|
| 1:44:57| face your accuser. Children are not involved in this. They're out of the juvenile facility, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| they're right next door to the courtroom. So children are an entirely different type situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6301)|
| 1:45:08| However, this email goes on to say, however, it's estimated that thousands of inmates every year are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6308)|
| 1:45:14| scheduled for appearances in Knox County Court that can easily be done over a video link with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6314)|
| 1:45:20| the court in accordance with the law and the Constitution. We're talking about administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6320)|
| 1:45:25| type hearings, arraignments, those types of things. Yes, you have a right to face your accuser. There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6325)|
| 1:45:31| will be many instances where people will be brought to court, and we will have trials and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6331)|
| 1:45:35| hearings. Now, this email goes on to say, in order to facilitate timely video appearances and clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6335)|
| 1:45:41| communication, I want to mention clear communication because, as I mentioned last time, Judge Irwin's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6341)|
| 1:45:47| been doing this for two years. And what they do is they take a laptop, they take it into the pod,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6347)|
| 1:45:52| and they try to communicate via Skype. And so you've got noise, you've got people yelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6352)|
| 1:45:56| you've got all kinds of noise. It's not very conducive to conducting a hearing. So these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6356)|
| 1:46:01| folks have an opportunity and should have an opportunity to have a quiet place where they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6361)|
| 1:46:06| communicate with the folks who are doing this video arraignment. And the same thing goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6366)|
| 1:46:11| with the magistrates. And so it goes on to say clear communication between the defendant and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6371)|
| 1:46:16| his or her attorney. The proposed video facility at the Knox County Detention Facility is a necessity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6376)|
| 1:46:23| Such a resource will be used well beyond the end of the pandemic. So they're on record as saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6383)|
| 1:46:29| that it's going to be used beyond the pandemic. Let me mention a couple of other things. And I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6389)|
| 1:46:34| was pleased to hear Mrs. Hill say that her clients have gone to the Family Justice Center. I'm the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6394)|
| 1:46:39| board president of the Family Justice Center, and I'm glad to hear her say that people are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6399)|
| 1:46:44| served there and receiving the services that they need. Funding for the Family Justice Center has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6404)|
| 1:46:48| not been cut by Knox County or the city of Knoxville, both which provide funding. Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6408)|
| 1:46:54| takes care of the building. And if there's anything that goes wrong with that building, we call Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| County, they come and fix it. And the city of Knoxville has not cut their funding as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6417)|
| 1:47:02| But I'd also like to say that I sat in your city for a number of years, and I'm glad that you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6422)|
| 1:47:07| are there now instead of me. I'm enjoying the job that I have. I cannot tell you the number of times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6427)|
| 1:47:13| that we as a commission were threatened with lawsuits. And so I know that you were threatened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6433)|
| 1:47:18| with lawsuits here today. I will tell you again, the judges have said their responsibility is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6438)|
| 1:47:24| make sure that constitutional rights are protected. They have put that in writing for you. And so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6444)|
| 1:47:30| guess that what I would like to do is just close by saying you have your juvenile court judge in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6450)|
| 1:47:36| favor. Your magistrates are in favor. You have your three criminal judges that are in favor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6456)|
| 1:47:42| calling it a necessity. Five sessions judges are in favor. Your criminal court clerk is in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6462)|
| 1:47:48| I would add this. I talked with Judge McMillan in Fourth Circuit on Friday. He says that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6468)|
| 1:47:53| bring in about 10 to 50 inmates per month. By having this would help him. He actually has to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6473)|
| 1:47:58| fight for time now because I believe we have two cameras out there now. I'm talking about six video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6478)|
| 1:48:03| courtrooms, which is going to help expedite things a lot. There's no question that this is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6483)|
| 1:48:07| provide savings. But my point is, we're elected officials too. And so it's our responsibility to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6487)|
| 1:48:14| come to you and say, we believe we have an efficient means that's going to help the process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6494)|
| 1:48:20| that is going to be a long term, something that will be learned going on long term, even past the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| pandemic. And so we answer the taxpayers just like you do. And so we're here asking you for this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6505)|
| 1:48:30| because as the judges said, we believe it's a necessity. And I'm not sure how much time I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6510)|
| 1:48:35| left. Do I have about a minute, Mr. Chairman? You don't, but I'll go ahead and give you one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6515)|
| 1:48:40| because I imagine there'll be some questions. And then I am going to get to one of our public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6520)|
| 1:48:44| speakers that was in the forum. But go ahead and wrap it up, Mr. Chairman. My last minute is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6524)|
| 1:48:50| How did this all come about? I think that's important. We have been having meetings for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6530)|
| 1:48:54| several months of what we call the stakeholders. That's the judges. That's the DA, public bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6534)|
| 1:49:01| the public defender, the clerks, the sheriff's office. We've been having meetings for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6541)|
| 1:49:07| And this issue of not having the ability to do remote hearings has been brought up several times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6547)|
| 1:49:13| And so three to four months ago, it was brought up that, can we do something? Is there something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6553)|
| 1:49:18| we can do to help provide a better means of communication, a better means of having these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6558)|
| 1:49:23| remote hearings? And so at that point, the sheriff came back with a proposal and says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6563)|
| 1:49:29| I believe we can build a facility at the detention center. And at that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6569)|
| 1:49:32| the stakeholder said, let's go for it and let's see if we can do this. And so that's how it all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6572)|
| 1:49:39| came about. It wasn't something that just came up last week or last month. This is something we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6579)|
| 1:49:43| been talking about for several weeks. And so that's why we're presenting it to you now. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6583)|
| 1:49:49| really feel that this is something that will be helpful in the future. And Mr. Jay, let me also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| mention one other thing. I have my chief deputy Richard Major here. I'm not a lawyer. He can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6593)|
| 1:49:58| into the weeds and answer any questions that you might have in the weeds. And so I just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6598)|
| 1:50:02| know that he is available to do that. But thank you so much for giving me the chance to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6602)|
| 1:50:06| CHAIR BAILET Thank you very much, Mr. Hammond. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6606)|
| 1:50:09| stand by with your team. I'm going to, before we open up for more conversation amongst the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6609)|
| 1:50:14| commissioners, I'm going to call on our last public forum member who had this as an item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6614)|
| 1:50:19| We had a little technical difficulty. So we're going to try one last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6619)|
| 1:50:22| Calling Sarah McDonald. And if Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| MR. MCDONALD I just spoke with her a few moments ago and she was having technical difficulties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6625)|
| 1:50:29| CHAIR BAILET Okay. Well, we tried three times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6629)|
| 1:50:32| MR. MCDONALD Oh, here she is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6632)|
| 1:50:33| CHAIR BAILET Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6633)|
| 1:50:34| MR. MCDONALD See if we can get her in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6634)|
| 1:50:35| CHAIR BAILET Let's see if we can get her in. And if so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6635)|
| 1:50:37| we'll hear from her and we will then proceed. Ms. McDonald.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6637)|
| 1:50:56| Ms. McDonald, are you with us? I believe. Oh, there you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6656)|
| 1:51:02| MS. MCDONALD Yay. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| CHAIR BAILET No problem. If you would, please state your name and your county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6664)|
| 1:51:09| And you have five minutes if you're unable to see the screen. Are you able to see the screen or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6669)|
| 1:51:14| MS. MCDONALD I'm not. I'm a dial in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6674)|
| 1:51:16| CHAIR BAILET You have five minutes and I will give you a warning with one minute left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6676)|
| 1:51:20| MS. MCDONALD Awesome. Thank you. Okay. Well, I am Sarah McDonald. I am in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6680)|
| 1:51:28| And obviously, I have a few problems with my ability to connect to Internet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6688)|
| 1:51:34| or phone access for Zoom meetings, which is why I am opposing this measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6694)|
| 1:51:42| Public is a wide range of abilities. And although I am generally a competent person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6702)|
| 1:51:50| being a survivor of domestic abuse has left me in a situation where I am unable to access what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6710)|
| 1:51:56| would be normal Internet, normal communications for the average person. As a matter of fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6716)|
| 1:52:04| this is something, it's a horrible, slippery slope for people who are working in the juvenile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| justice system, who are working with the courts. Because I am expected to, I'm expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6728)|
| 1:52:27| to be able to access the Internet. So, I think the technical difficulties are going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6747)|
| 1:52:30| ahead of us. Jacob, if you would just, I'm sorry, Ms. McDonald, that the technical difficulties are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6750)|
| 1:52:36| not going to allow us to hear from you. So, Jacob, if you would maybe just remove that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6756)|
| 1:52:42| We'll start by opening up to questions. I see Commissioner Daly first and then Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6762)|
| 1:52:48| Biggs, if you would go ahead, Mr. Daly. MR. DALY Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6768)|
| 1:52:55| give the opportunity to Sheriff Spangler and our law department to make any comments on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6775)|
| 1:53:01| speakers and especially the sheriff. And I'll turn it over to you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6781)|
| 1:53:07| CHAIRMAN HOVLAND Okay. Commissioner, Sheriff Spangler, are you with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6787)|
| 1:53:12| COMMISSIONER SPANGLER I am, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| CHAIRMAN HOVLAND If you would just identify yourself and go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6794)|
| 1:53:18| COMMISSIONER SPANGLER Tom Spangler, North County Sheriff, 400 Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6798)|
| 1:53:21| I'm not sure where to start other than maybe I can clarify some things. I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6801)|
| 1:53:28| obviously the bus that's sitting on top of me is pretty heavy right now. I say that in a joking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6808)|
| 1:53:33| manner, but I'm also serious about the fact that I think that with what was going on, I think when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6813)|
| 1:53:40| presented this to the stakeholders, I thought maybe this was a good idea, and I still think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6820)|
| 1:53:46| it's a great idea. But I guess I'm the mouthpiece for the whole group, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6826)|
| 1:53:54| But this commission will make their decision on how they feel things are going. I am for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6834)|
| 1:54:03| I understand that there are some questions, and I understand that people have some concerns about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6843)|
| 1:54:09| But I don't think that it seems like we jumped into this, but as Mr. Hammond said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6849)|
| 1:54:14| we've been talking about this for quite some time, and maybe I should have come up with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6854)|
| 1:54:19| a long time ago, but I guess my slowness, or whatever you want to call it, just didn't catch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6859)|
| 1:54:24| on. And when I proposed that this could possibly happen out there, I was looking for a remedy for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6864)|
| 1:54:32| all of Knox County. This is a minimal, if you will, for the Knox County Sheriff's Office. I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6872)|
| 1:54:38| not standing up here advocating this just for the Sheriff's Office. There is no way that I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6878)|
| 1:54:44| come to this commission and ask them for $1.5 million for something I think that would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6884)|
| 1:54:49| fruitless, and I think I've told you all that from the very beginning. This is something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6889)|
| 1:54:53| came from a group, and here I am as the mouthpiece for it, and I think Mike Hammond put it very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6893)|
| 1:55:01| eloquently. This is something that is definitely needed. Now, you've got both sides. There's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6901)|
| 1:55:06| always two sides to the story, and you're going to hear both sides, and you've heard both sides,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6906)|
| 1:55:13| and that's for you all to determine how you want to go with it. I think what it does, it does help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6913)|
| 1:55:19| within us bringing people. Mr. Hammond mentioned in that memo, yeah, the judges are going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6919)|
| 1:55:26| the ones who decide how much they use this. That will be up to them. Some of the question was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6926)|
| 1:55:33| is it going to be used after the pandemic? From what I hear from several of the judges,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6933)|
| 1:55:37| they absolutely want to do that, and that's great. Some judges may say, well, we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6937)|
| 1:55:42| have more hearings back downtown. Yeah, that's going to reduce if we have the hearings at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6942)|
| 1:55:48| facility, in this new facility, then yeah, that's going to cut back on some of our trips or quite a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6948)|
| 1:55:54| bit of our trips because what's going to be heard, 65% of the cases that are going to be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6954)|
| 1:56:00| virtually by video arraignment is going to be arraignments and plea deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6960)|
| 1:56:05| It's not going to be trials. They're not going to do trials on the internet, period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6965)|
| 1:56:09| That's not going to happen. I think there's a misconception there, so we just want to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6969)|
| 1:56:14| sure that that's clear too. I'm not sure what questions that I will have towards me. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6974)|
| 1:56:21| the majority of them may come from Mr. Hammond or at least towards him and Mr. Major and him being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6981)|
| 1:56:29| the attorney. Like Mr. Hammond said, I'm sure anytime you get threatened with a lawsuit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6989)|

| 1:56:38| sheriff and you're running the jail, those happen on a daily basis. The judges would not sign off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=6998)|
| 1:56:46| on something that they thought that they were violating somebody's rights of any kind. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7006)|
| 1:56:50| think that that's ever going to happen. Trusting me when I say that, look, this is something that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7010)|
| 1:56:57| I think that it's beneficial for all of Knox County. I'm not coming to you as a sheriff saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7017)|
| 1:57:03| just the sheriff's office needs this. No, I'm not. I'm not doing that. I'm doing this and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7023)|
| 1:57:08| being the mouthpiece for all of the stakeholders that are involved in this. Like I said, that bus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7028)|
| 1:57:14| sitting on my chest right now is pretty heavy, so I'll leave it at that. Thank you, Sheriff Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7034)|
| 1:57:19| Commissioner Daley, you still have the floor and you have the mute button to hit as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7039)|
| 1:57:27| I apologize. I hate Zoom meetings. Hey, Sheriff, have you talked to the Sheriff of Hamilton County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7047)|
| 1:57:34| and got any information back from him how they've been doing video court for a couple of years now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7054)|
| 1:57:40| As a matter of fact, I was at the Tennessee Sheriff's Association last week with Paul asking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7060)|
| 1:57:45| yes, I did talk to them about it. It's going very well for them. They've been using it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7065)|
| 1:57:50| quite some time. As I mentioned, and as you said, we don't do any of them on trial. We don't do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7070)|
| 1:57:57| that. Obviously, you can't do that. We're not going to take away the rights of the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7077)|
| 1:58:02| I think part of what also this does, and I don't mean to get away from your question there. I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7082)|
| 1:58:07| I'm rambling a little bit, but what it does too is it gets those individuals back out of our facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7087)|
| 1:58:13| quicker and gets them back to their families if that's where they're going. They're not having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7093)|
| 1:58:18| to be brought down here for that hearing or that plea deal, taken back to the facility and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7098)|
| 1:58:22| brought back to the city county building to be released because that's the way it's supposed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7102)|
| 1:58:26| go. It does help on transporting that when getting those individuals back to their families and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7106)|
| 1:58:34| getting them out of the facility. When they come downtown to this facility as well, there is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7114)|
| 1:58:39| we call the slam. That's where the inmates are held until they are heard. You talk about lawsuits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7119)|
| 1:58:46| that's one coming right there. Too many people in one area and we have to be able to keep them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7126)|
| 1:58:51| confined in one area and to be able to make sure that security is handled just as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7131)|
| 1:58:57| But yes, he's very happy the way things have been going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7137)|
| 1:59:01| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7141)|
| 1:59:06| Thank you, Chairman Jay. I have a few questions. Number one, I was reading the resolution that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7146)|
| 1:59:12| attached and it's not the new resolution that we were presented last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7152)|
| 1:59:21| The resolution caption that was read and is attached, you're saying is not the same one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7161)|
| 1:59:26| that was sent out on Friday afternoon? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7166)|
| 1:59:30| What is the difference? Hang on, I'll read it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7170)|
| 1:59:35| It was one sent out for commissioners. It looks like 422 on Friday by Drusilla.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7175)|
| 1:59:45| Yes, sir. The one that's attached to the agenda that doesn't speak anything about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7185)|
| 1:59:49| the second whereas where it states that the facility wouldn't be used for any other purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7189)|
| 1:59:54| other than virtual meetings or virtual court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7194)|
| 2:00:06| You're saying it doesn't have a whereas or that states that? I know that's stated in the email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7206)|
| 2:00:14| Are you saying that you're looking for a whereas in the language? I'm sorry to I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7214)|
| 2:00:20| clarify. Yeah, I guess I guess it was a friendly amendment for the new resolution, but it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7220)|
| 2:00:25| on this language that we have attached to our working agenda. So is this the one that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7225)|
| 2:00:31| specifically voting on? Or is it the new resolution? I guess is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7231)|
| 2:00:39| It would be the new one that was emailed out on Friday. If it's not attached here. Let's get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7239)|
| 2:00:45| attached real quick. If this is not the exact same one. I'm sorry, we just said it looks like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7245)|
| 2:00:51| clear I'm getting a note from drew this that she's attaching it now. So I'll go ahead. Let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7251)|
| 2:00:58| continue the kind of I'll come back. Do you have additional questions while we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7258)|
| 2:01:03| Yeah, my second question was was I was trying to look through all the data that we were provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7263)|
| 2:01:09| It talks about maybe technical difficulties. You know, I mean, it's been stated tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7269)|
| 2:01:14| you know, we don't really overly care for all the things that's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7274)|
| 2:01:20| And this isn't going to be managed by Knox County it I would imagine so it'll be managed by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7280)|
| 2:01:25| sheriff's department it is that something as well as I was kind of hoping that I would see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7285)|
| 2:01:32| something that states how many prisoners we had let out during the COVID and how that went,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7292)|
| 2:01:39| as well as where the numbers are at the current moment. And do we expect those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7299)|
| 2:01:43| numbers to accelerate and come back into where they were pre COVID numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7303)|
| 2:01:48| I'm not sure where to start by answering that Commissioner Biggs. What I will tell you is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7308)|
| 2:01:52| we've got over 2600 on pre trial right now, which means those are the people who whenever they come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7312)|
| 2:01:59| in, they spend enough time in there to be booked and they're back out of our facility before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7319)|
| 2:02:07| before COVID hit, you had a facility out there you're looking at times anywhere from 1200 to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7327)|
| 2:02:13| 1300 inmates and we're down to I believe it is 900, maybe 800 right now with that number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7333)|
| 2:02:22| I think you heard last week or at least last month from Mr. Hammond saying that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7342)|
| 2:02:27| 18,000 cases now, because of COVID that are backed up. So that's going to take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7347)|
| 2:02:35| Who knows how long that's going to be. So that's what I have for you right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7355)|
| 2:02:41| Thank you, Sheriff. Is there anybody from IT that could answer my technical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7361)|
| 2:02:46| difficulties problem? Can you restate that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7366)|
| 2:02:50| So just like you know, tonight, people having technical difficulties coming in through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7370)|
| 2:02:54| lines and things of that nature and video feed, I was just wanting to see you know, what where are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7374)|
| 2:03:00| we at? Is that going to be an additional IT cost, things of that nature, like once this is established?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7380)|
| 2:03:08| Oh, I can speak to what I know if that's okay. If you could just identify yourself and your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7388)|
| 2:03:12| department, sir. Zach Webb, Knox County IT. So my understanding is that that entire operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7392)|
| 2:03:18| will be handled by the Sheriff's IT side. Now that said, we'll be interfacing with courtrooms on at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7398)|
| 2:03:24| the CCB that is handled by Knox County IT proper, if that makes sense. So it's kind of two. We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7404)|
| 2:03:29| already doing it now. This is just an expanded, you know, we're going to be doing it in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7409)|
| 2:03:34| two. We're already doing it now. This is just an expanded facility to do the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7414)|
| 2:03:40| Yeah, the main reason is, Mr. Webb, is I was just kind of wondering, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7420)|
| 2:03:45| what happens if the feed's messed up? Does that backlog us even more with courts and things of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7425)|
| 2:03:49| that nature and just kind of make sure that we're not going to have a huge area where kinks are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7429)|
| 2:03:54| going to be placed in there for us? Yeah, I think from our side, from the courtroom side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7434)|
| 2:04:00| the management in the CCB and the areas here, no, because we already have that plan for and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7440)|
| 2:04:06| we're already covered and we're doing that. I would ask, you know, the Sheriff to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7446)|
| 2:04:12| Aaron Arnell and the people on his side to speak to their need. But as far as my side goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7452)|
| 2:04:16| we're covered. Okay. So also, you know, I know sometimes people break into meetings and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7456)|
| 2:04:23| of that nature. We've seen it multiple times through Zoom conference calls throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7463)|
| 2:04:27| Is that also going to be protected by the Sheriff's Office so things of that nature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7467)|
| 2:04:31| don't happen in the middle of court? So the meeting itself is handled on the courtroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7471)|
| 2:04:35| side unless that's changed on the back end. We use a secure internal platform for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7475)|
| 2:04:40| They're not public meetings like these Zoom meetings are. The links, you're secured through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7480)|
| 2:04:45| our multi-factor authentication on the back end. Mr. Chairman, if I might, if I might inject here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7485)|
| 2:04:51| on Mr. Biggs, Richard Major is here and he works very closely with IT on putting all this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7491)|
| 2:04:56| If it's appropriate, I'd like for him to answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7496)|
| 2:04:59| Sure. Go ahead. If you could identify yourself and your department, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7499)|
| 2:05:05| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Richard Major from Knox County. I currently serve as Magistrate and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7505)|
| 2:05:11| Administrator for the Criminal Courts. And one of my interesting jobs that we've taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7511)|
| 2:05:16| on in the last year was working with Zach Webb's folks to set up the video court process that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7516)|
| 2:05:21| been developed over the last year. And first of all, I'd like to say that you cannot say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7521)|
| 2:05:26| enough good about Knox County IT and the hard work they have done in supporting the courts as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| we've begun to roll this process out over these last many months. To Commissioner Biggs' question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7531)|
| 2:05:40| a moment ago as to how the process is working and how individuals may break into a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7540)|
| 2:05:46| the Knox County Criminal Courts have been doing the vast majority of their work by video through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7546)|
| 2:05:51| Microsoft Teams for most of the last nine months. I have participated in, I wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7551)|
| 2:05:57| say the majority of, but a great number of those conferences specifically. I've administered many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7557)|
| 2:06:02| of them. And I am unaware of any case of anyone breaking into a meeting who was not invited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7562)|
| 2:06:07| The way that structure works is we set up a team. That team is limited to the members that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7567)|
| 2:06:15| court administrator or secretary allows into the meeting. That's usually a specific number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7575)|
| 2:06:19| of lawyers in addition to a specific number of users at the jail as well as the judges. You have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7579)|
| 2:06:25| to be a member to be allowed into the meeting. So that's how we control who gets in and who does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7585)|
| 2:06:31| get in. Thank you, Mr. Major. I will also note that the revised resolution has been uploaded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7591)|
| 2:06:40| to the online agenda and that is live now for your review. Moving down the list, Mr. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7600)|
| 2:06:47| you have the floor. I believe, well, Commissioner Ward's hand is up before mine, but if he's okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7607)|
| 2:06:58| I'll go ahead. Sorry, I didn't, I just got him as I saw him. So go ahead. You can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7618)|
| 2:07:07| First question I have is do we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7627)|
| 2:07:10| change our motion to reflect this resolution that does have the language in it in the second whereas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7630)|
| 2:07:22| as opposed to what is on the floor, on the floor was the resolution off of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7642)|
| 2:07:29| Just a technical question there. Second, I wanted to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7649)|
| 2:07:35| Director Caldwell, one of our public speakers referenced our financial situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7655)|
| 2:07:45| And she said that we were, I believe, a couple million dollars behind on revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7665)|
| 2:07:52| I want you to address that, please. Thank you, Commissioner Smith. As we discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7672)|
| 2:07:59| at Finance Committee last week and the documentation that you all received,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7679)|
| 2:08:04| and we went over at Chairman's briefing as well, our revenues in the general fund are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7684)|
| 2:08:09| 5.3 million dollars higher through December than they were last December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7689)|
| 2:08:15| Our expenses are about the same. Local option sales tax is up 4% over our five-year average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7695)|
| 2:08:23| through that same time frame. Property tax is up 6% over our five-year average through that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7703)|
| 2:08:29| same time frame. So we are trending well above what we had budgeted for in revenue. I would tell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7709)|
| 2:08:38| you sales tax will probably get in more than 25 million more than what was budgeted for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7718)|
| 2:08:45| including schools, of course, and then the bulk of that goes to schools. But no, from a financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7725)|
| 2:08:51| standpoint, we are nowhere near a deficit. We are in great financial shape and we most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7731)|
| 2:08:58| definitely, as we sit here today, will have a budget surplus to end the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7738)|
| 2:09:04| So to be perfectly clear, nothing will be cut for this capital, to do this capital project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7744)|
| 2:09:10| Nothing will be cut, and I would go back to what Mr. Hammond said. I don't know where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7750)|
| 2:09:17| information came from about cutting of the Family Justice Center. That is not true. We own the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7757)|
| 2:09:23| building that the Family Justice Center is in, and we pay for that operation. It's about $150,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7763)|
| 2:09:30| annually. And so last year, as we did the budget process, if you'll recall, we really didn't make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7770)|
| 2:09:39| drastic cuts. We just reduced it to reflect what we were being told from our peers and the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7779)|
| 2:09:46| as to what we could expect in revenue. Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7786)|
| 2:09:51| Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Smith. Back to your first question, I think what you might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7791)|
| 2:09:58| doing is offering a friendly amendment to Commissioner Daley that his motion be to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7798)|
| 2:10:05| the revised resolution. Is that accurate? Is that okay with you, Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7805)|
| 2:10:10| It is. And Commissioner Smith has a second on that. You're okay with that as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7810)|
| 2:10:15| Okay. We'll take that. Commissioner Ward, you're up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7815)|
| 2:10:21| Thank you. I have two clarifying questions and then one actual question, just so that I make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7821)|
| 2:10:28| sure I understand. If any inmate requests to have an in-person court hearing, they can have an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7828)|
| 2:10:33| in-person court hearing, correct? Who wants to answer that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7833)|
| 2:10:41| If the judge wants to provide that, yes. So they would make their appeal to the judge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7841)|
| 2:10:45| and the judge would make that decision. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7845)|
| 2:10:50| Say, if I may, there are some where the courts would be required to. Obviously, the judges are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7850)|
| 2:10:56| going to have some discretion on some things. I do think a lot of this is speculative, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7856)|
| 2:11:02| because as it stands right now, Rule 43 only would allow for arraignments and initial appearances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7862)|
| 2:11:09| And so, if that rule is changed at some point in the future, we have no way of knowing what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7869)|
| 2:11:15| rule, how that would read if it were to be changed. And so, I don't know that I could answer that for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7875)|
| 2:11:23| certain, because it's sort of calls for an answer of something that hasn't come to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7883)|
| 2:11:27| Is the Supreme Court hearing anything about this anytime soon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7887)|
| 2:11:31| I don't know. I mean, they have periodically been extending orders. Our initial order from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7891)|
| 2:11:37| Supreme Court dates back to March of last year. And at that time, they'd set an expiration of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7897)|
| 2:11:42| that order for a couple of months, and then it just periodically, as it gets close to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7902)|
| 2:11:45| expiration, they extend it, and they sometimes tweak it a little bit. As our numbers have gone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7905)|
| 2:11:51| up, sometimes they've made some changes. As COVID numbers have gone down, they've made other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7911)|
| 2:11:55| changes. For example, like suspension of jury trials, they've made some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7915)|
| 2:11:59| For example, like suspension of jury trials. We're not having jury trials right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| but those are going to start back up again soon. So, I have no idea what the Supreme Court's going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7922)|
| 2:12:08| to do. Got you. Thank you, sir. The second question I had was, we currently have three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7928)|
| 2:12:14| virtual courtrooms, correct? And we'll be adding an additional six, so we'll have nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7934)|
| 2:12:19| virtual courtrooms in total. Is that correct? Mr. Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7939)|
| 2:12:27| Yes, I'm going to let Mr. Major talk about that, because again, he's my IT guru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7947)|
| 2:12:35| Commissioner Ward, that is essentially correct. There are three available spaces with cameras,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7955)|
| 2:12:40| but it's important to note how those are distributed. Obviously, the sheriff can speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7960)|
| 2:12:44| to his facility better than I can, but there are two rooms out of the detention facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7964)|
| 2:12:48| on Maloneyville. One of those, those are divided up by men and women, which is a limitation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7968)|
| 2:12:54| The third is actually a small library space here downtown in this building that has a camera in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7974)|
| 2:13:00| Okay. I wouldn't necessarily call that a full courtroom space, but it is what we may do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7980)|
| 2:13:05| if we have someone who's down in the jail currently. So, are we going to-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7985)|
| 2:13:08| As I understand the proposal, the six spaces out of the Maloneyville facility would be larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7988)|
| 2:13:17| and equipped in such a way to provide a more court-like experience for the individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=7997)|
| 2:13:23| Rather than what is sometimes required now in these tiny spaces, we have to make do with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8003)|
| 2:13:28| Okay. So, are we going from three to six, or are we going from three to nine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8008)|
| 2:13:33| I think the answer is you're going from three to the capacity to nine, but really six that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8013)|
| 2:13:39| of a sufficient size to conduct a process the way it ought to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8019)|
| 2:13:43| Okay. So, if there is overflow, we do have the ability to go to nine if need be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8023)|
| 2:13:47| is what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8027)|
| 2:13:48| The issue has always been space. It's not technology. It's having the physical space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8028)|
| 2:13:51| to do so, and the place to isolate individuals from the rest of the folks who are being detained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8031)|
| 2:13:56| so that you have the necessary level of quietness to conduct a proceeding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8036)|
| 2:14:00| Understood. Thank you, sir. My last question is, from what I'm reading from the resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8040)|
| 2:14:09| that there's already a contractor in here. Is that- I don't think I've seen that before in any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8049)|
| 2:14:15| other resolution that's ever come before me, at least in my limited time on commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8055)|
| 2:14:19| But is that normal? And if so, are there blueprints and engineering specs and all that kind of stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8059)|
| 2:14:23| that are out there that we haven't gotten to see yet? And if so, what did the contract bid come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8063)|
| 2:14:28| at? What is- why is there a contractor already in this resolution? Is there an RFI that went out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8068)|
| 2:14:37| that I don't know about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8077)|
| 2:14:38| I think Mr. Myers or Mr. Caldwell might want to address that. There are specs and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8078)|
| 2:14:47| drawings in the presentation online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8087)|
| 2:14:53| That's out of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8093)|
| 2:14:55| Mr. Caldwell or Mr. Myers, do either of you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8095)|
| 2:15:01| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Matt Myers, Knox County Procurement. Yeah, I think in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8101)|
| 2:15:07| new resolution, we did add a contract for construction. It does have a rendering of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8107)|
| 2:15:14| the building. It also has a floor plan. More engineering documents will be forthcoming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8114)|
| 2:15:22| obviously, for the construction of the building. We wanted to go ahead and get the contract in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8122)|
| 2:15:28| place as well on this resolution, just so we can get going and get started and get the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8128)|
| 2:15:34| built. The contractor is one of our term contractors through the Public Building Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8134)|
| 2:15:42| They do contracts to certain levels. Shelton General Contractor has been a good contractor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8142)|
| 2:15:49| for Knox County, certainly more than capable to provide this service. And, you know, unless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8149)|
| 2:15:57| Sheriff Spangler has any more to add, that's why you're seeing a little bit of amended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8157)|
| 2:16:02| resolution from last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8162)|
| 2:16:04| Is there a number they've given us already that they think the construction cost is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8164)|
| 2:16:09| that's more accurate than just the general 1.5 cap?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8169)|
| 2:16:14| Well, I haven't been given any figure other than the 1.5. And that's why we put in the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8174)|
| 2:16:20| that it is not to exceed $1.5 million. I know Sheriff Spangler and some of his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8180)|
| 2:16:28| people have probably had a little bit more deeper conversation as they continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8188)|
| 2:16:32| to look at the site, look at the location of where the building is going to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8192)|
| 2:16:38| how we're connecting to the detention facility and things like that. Sheriff Spangler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8198)|
| 2:16:47| Yes, Matt, you're correct. And part of that is we went off of what our one prefab building that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8207)|
| 2:16:52| we have out there for our training facility was right at $750,000. And the PP&E, just to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8212)|
| 2:16:59| figure all of the rest of it in there, that's where that figure came from, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8219)|
| 2:17:04| We wanted to make sure we didn't exceed anything. That way, when we come to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8224)|
| 2:17:08| letting you know that could come in even cheaper than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8228)|
| 2:17:11| Okay. So do we have any competing bids? Or are we just saying we're going to go with this guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8231)|
| 2:17:15| and that's it? That's a question you'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8235)|
| 2:17:18| have to ask Mr. Myers. I think that has to do with the RA contract that they have that will piggyback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8238)|
| 2:17:26| That is correct, Sheriff. You know, the Sheriff's office came to us with this particular contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8246)|
| 2:17:31| who had already looked at the property. As I said, they are a term contractor. They have done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8251)|
| 2:17:37| numerous projects for us. They're a very trusted, very secure contractor. And I feel very good about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8257)|
| 2:17:45| Lynn Shelton or Shelton General Contractors performing the work here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8265)|
| 2:17:50| Sure. I'm sure they're a great contracting company. The Sheriff just told me a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8270)|
| 2:17:54| similar to it costs $750,000. You're asking for double and just having us write a blank check| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8274)|
| 2:18:00| just doesn't sit particularly well with me, but I understand the situation also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8280)|
| 2:18:06| That's all the questions I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8286)|
| 2:18:11| Okay, thank you, Commissioner Ward. Commissioner Lundy, you're up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8291)|
| 2:18:15| Well, thank you, Chairman Drake. I have a few constituents emailing me and I have a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8295)|
| 2:18:20| questions. This is more about the justice of it and this human rights. With this action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8300)|
| 2:18:26| could our public access and transparency within the judicial system? Can somebody answer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8306)|
| 2:18:37| Mr. Majors, do you want to address that? Mr. Hammond said you were on the legal side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8317)|
| 2:18:42| I'm happy to, Mr. Chairman. I'm happy to address that. As far as transparency and access to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8322)|
| 2:18:50| courts, Commissioner, looking to a post-pandemic world where you will have open physical courtrooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8330)|
| 2:18:59| in the event that this video technology was used, people would have access to the physical courtroom| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8339)|
| 2:19:05| in the same way that they have always had access to a physical courtroom. They would be able to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8345)|
| 2:19:10| the inmate in open court as they're discussing their case for arraignment or whatever other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8350)|
| 2:19:16| matter. The only difference would be that the inmate would not physically be in the room, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8356)|
| 2:19:21| rather would be available by video. But it would still be open courts and open access in a way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8361)|
| 2:19:26| it always was pre-pandemic. Okay, thank you. Another question, will the individuals facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8366)|
| 2:19:34| charges feel more isolated and less likely to assess resources and advice from their counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8374)|
| 2:19:40| on their behalf? So I guess I'm saying, will they have that privacy to talk to their attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8380)|
| 2:19:46| Commissioner, obviously I don't want to venture a guess to how folks may feel or what their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8386)|
| 2:19:55| individual interpretation may be of the situation. As far as access, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8395)|
| 2:19:59| they would have the same access to meeting with their lawyer prior to court as they would in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8399)|
| 2:20:06| in-person appearance. That's really all I can say to answer that question. Mr. Lutton may have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8406)|
| 2:20:12| thoughts on that as well, and the Sheriff can speak more to what their actual visitation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8412)|
| 2:20:15| process at the jail is. But merely having a process like an arraignment over video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8415)|
| 2:20:22| does not prohibit lawyers from meeting with their clients. But the only option will be for them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8422)|
| 2:20:29| meet with them prior to their appearance, but they can't talk to them during the arraignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8429)|
| 2:20:38| Well, if the process that we have been using now in the courts is what this would look like in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8438)|
| 2:20:44| long term, and I think that's probably a fair assumption, there is a phone line available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8444)|
| 2:20:49| where lawyers can speak with their clients while they are in court if they have any questions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8449)|
| 2:20:54| want to have a conversation that is private and not open to others. I can't imagine that that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8454)|
| 2:21:00| would be removed by any judge, and that's what's available right now, and that's how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8460)|
| 2:21:05| that has been handled by the judges for the last nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8465)|
| 2:21:10| Mr. Lutton, I would love to hear your thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8470)|
| 2:21:14| I do think that there are some issues there, and among my concerns is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8474)|
| 2:21:22| practicing law has been incredibly challenging during the pandemic, and one of the ways that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8482)|
| 2:21:27| it is incredibly challenging is not having an ability to lean over and talk to your client,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8487)|
| 2:21:33| or the number of times that I will see things sort of go off the rails a little bit because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8493)|
| 2:21:37| a client is, you're not directly beside them. During normal times, a client might start to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8497)|
| 2:21:42| speak up and either assert some fact or say something out loud where they really need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8502)|
| 2:21:48| not asking, they need to be asking their lawyer questions and not speaking up and interacting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8508)|
| 2:21:51| directly with court, and unfortunately, that does happen when you don't have the lawyer that can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8511)|
| 2:21:55| there and, you know, put a hand on their shoulder or, you know, hey, ask me, you know, ask me the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8515)|
| 2:21:59| question. There's also, you know, in terms of access to justice, there's also issues of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8519)|
| 2:22:06| you know, we know from data that recidivism rates go up, that people are more likely to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8526)|
| 2:22:12| reoffend if you cut off their community ties when they're incarcerated. Among the things that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8532)|
| 2:22:17| happen, even at arraignments, you know, this might not seem like a big deal, but even at arraignments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8537)|
| 2:22:21| you know, where we're getting appointed to a case and, you know, the family is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8541)|
| 2:22:25| and you're able to sort of go talk to the family and talk to your client, hey, your mom's here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8545)|
| 2:22:30| your sister's here, you know, they want to be a pass along that they love you, they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8550)|
| 2:22:34| try and do a video chat with you next Tuesday. The communication that you can sort of have back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8554)|
| 2:22:39| and forth, you know, contemporaneously, I think is important during court proceedings. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8559)|
| 2:22:46| candidly, it is, I do believe that it is critical during arraignments, but it is obviously more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8566)|
| 2:22:52| critical in other proceedings. And so with talk of, you know, possibly an attempt to amend Rule 43,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8572)|
| 2:23:00| which would allow potentially other types of proceedings to be heard remotely, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8580)|
| 2:23:04| I worry what that means for justice going forward. I think it's important to remember that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8584)|
| 2:23:10| supposed to be operating a criminal justice system and not a criminal processing system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8590)|
| 2:23:14| although I do recognize the challenges of that we are way behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8594)|
| 2:23:19| Thank you. Also, just some data that I just want to share since we are public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8599)|
| 2:23:28| it said one study of criminal bail hearings found that defendants whose hearings are conducted over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8608)|
| 2:23:33| video have a higher bond amount set than an in-person counterpart. Also, another study of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8613)|
| 2:23:40| immigration courts found that the detained individual will more likely be deported when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8620)|
| 2:23:46| their hearings occurred over video conference rather than person. And then the last one is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8626)|
| 2:23:54| a three out of six surveyed immigrants court judges identified instances where they had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8634)|
| 2:23:58| changed credibility assessments made during a video hearing after holding an in-person hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8638)|
| 2:24:05| So, it seems like it's going to be a lot of confusion with communication. I'm all for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8645)|
| 2:24:13| efficiency. I believe in efficiency, but I just don't think this is the right time for this right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8653)|
| 2:24:19| now. I think it's, you know, we still need to—people who are in jail or going on trial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8659)|
| 2:24:26| they're still humans, and I'm with you, Mr. Lutton, that we need to make sure we maintain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8666)|
| 2:24:31| that human contact because they—even though they've probably done some bad things or illegal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8671)|
| 2:24:36| things, they're still humans, and they need to see their family and all this, so we don't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8676)|
| 2:24:41| to take away that from them. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner Lundy. By evidence of all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8681)|
| 2:24:49| the reminders that are popping up on the screens around commission, our zoning meeting starts at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8689)|
| 2:24:54| seven. So, I see Commissioner Durrett, Hill, and Beeler. We can either march through and head| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8694)|
| 2:25:04| towards a vote before seven, or we can continue with the conversation, recess, and come back to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8704)|
| 2:25:10| it. I'm obviously open to either one of those. I just want to keep everybody aware that in 14| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8710)|
| 2:25:16| minutes we have zoning. So, I'll call on Commissioner Durrett, and we'll see how it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8716)|
| 2:25:21| I'm willing to hold off if we need to, as long as Eric Lutton and Richard Major can be here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8721)|
| 2:25:31| as long as they can stay on past the zoning and come back so we can talk with them more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8731)|

| 2:25:46| That won't be a problem, Commissioner. I can certainly do that. Can I ask how long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8746)|
| 2:25:53| you anticipate zoning to last? I'm trying to figure out if I have time to grab a quick dinner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8753)|

| 2:26:08| have a quick break. Now, we will hold and put this meeting into recess and return to item 25,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8768)|
| 2:26:15| so we have the ability to have a substantive discussion before a vote on that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8775)|
| 2:26:22| Yes, sir? I'm sorry. I've got another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=8782)|

| 2:31:12| Mr. Garnard, maybe you could, uh, identify who is supporting the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9072)|
| 2:31:19| That would be, um, Gerald Green, Chris Granju, and Mike Brousseau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9079)|
| 2:31:25| Okay. And, uh, can I then assume that Charles Taylor and Courtney Shea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9085)|
| 2:31:34| are they with us, and are they our opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9094)|

| 2:32:06| I don't believe she's going to participate. I took her place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9126)|
| 2:32:09| Okay. All right. Thank you for identifying yourself. Okay. Um, I'll try to do my best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9129)|
| 2:32:14| to balance, uh, both of those, but if, uh, we could start with, um, Ms. Brooks from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9134)|

| 2:32:35| because it is consistent with the North City Sector Plan's low-density residential designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9155)|
| 2:32:41| and retain the F Floodway Overlay District by a vote of 13 to 0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9161)|
| 2:32:46| Okay. Thank you very much. We'll start with the applicant, Mr. Gennard. Now, you have four people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9166)|
| 2:32:52| on your team. I'm going to give you a total of 15 minutes, if we could put up a clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9172)|
| 2:33:01| and then I will give the same amount of time if they wish to the opposition. You can stop and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9181)|
| 2:33:07| start that as you will, but if you would, uh, you have the floor, and if you all would identify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9187)|
| 2:33:12| yourself with by your name and your address as you take, uh, the position and present to Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9192)|
| 2:33:18| We'll start with you, Mr. Gennard. Yeah. Uh, Commissioner Jay, um, we don't need 15 minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9198)|
| 2:33:27| unless the Commission wants to ask us questions, but I'd like the opposition to go first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9207)|
| 2:33:31| Um, we, we, we're going to follow the rules of our Commission, which says that the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9211)|
| 2:33:37| goes first, and then we hear from opposition that will go back and forth. So, you're up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9217)|
| 2:33:42| Okay. Randy Gennard, 5408 Fountain Gate Road. All property owners of Knox County have the right to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9222)|
| 2:33:50| the highest and best use for their land. We know the highest and best use for this property is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9230)|
| 2:33:56| development with single-family homes. With a housing inventory at an all-time low in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9236)|

| 2:34:08| the plans for this rezoning. I'm asking to rezone this land from flood, industrial, and general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9248)|
| 2:34:16| residential to plan residential with a density of 2.51 dwelling units per acre. As for planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9256)|
| 2:34:24| staff recommendation, this will also help in fulfilling the affordable housing need in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9264)|
| 2:34:31| Responsible development takes a team. We have assembled one that is second to none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9271)|
| 2:34:39| Here are some of our team members who are available to answer questions during this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9279)|
| 2:34:44| Gerald Green, the former Executive Director of MPC from 2015 through 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9284)|
| 2:34:51| Michael Brousseau, former Staff Planner for MPC from 2000 to 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9291)|
| 2:34:59| Chris Ronjue, former Knox County Stormwater Director for over 24 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9299)|
| 2:35:07| The team has shared letters of support for this project via email with all of the commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9307)|
| 2:35:13| to further explain their stance. There will be 16 acres of land donated to Legacy Parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9313)|
| 2:35:20| Foundation when this rezoning is granted. This land donation also includes a walking trail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9320)|
| 2:35:26| easement located on the ridgetop that leads to shopping and to Knox County Parks. The reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9326)|
| 2:35:33| the land has not yet been donated is that should this property not be rezoned and remains industrial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9333)|
| 2:35:39| the land could be used for parking lots and storage areas for materials. They could include,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9339)|
| 2:35:44| but are not limited to, tires, asphalt shingles, building materials, scrap cars, parks, and more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9344)|
| 2:35:55| As it is currently zoned, the land can have manufacturing plants in the lower section of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9355)|
| 2:36:00| the land, while the upper portion can have up to 252 apartments. The majority of commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9360)|
| 2:36:09| have toured the site and those who have have seen the true potential in developing this land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9369)|
| 2:36:18| into a community with affordable homes. It is without a doubt a challenging site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9378)|
| 2:36:25| especially if the traditional scrape and build concept of development is to occur. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9385)|
| 2:36:32| developed a preliminary green build concept plan that ensures the infrastructure will be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9392)|
| 2:36:39| for this site. This would be addressed more specifically at the concept plan stage. I ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9399)|
| 2:36:46| that you vote to follow the staff recommendation rezoning with no less than 2.51 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9406)|
| 2:36:54| Should the rezoning request be amended to less than 184 homes, I will respectfully request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9414)|
| 2:37:02| withdrawal of this application, at which point the property will remain as industrial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9422)|
| 2:37:08| and apartments. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9428)|
| 2:37:11| Thank you, Mr. Gennard. You used approximately four minutes, and I know the rest of your team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9431)|
| 2:37:18| is there for additional questions, so I'll look to Mr. Charles Taylor on the opposition. I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9438)|
| 2:37:23| give you also four minutes to begin, and then we'll take it from there. So, Mr. Taylor, if you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9443)|
| 2:37:29| would, please turn your microphone on and your camera, if possible, and please state your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9449)|
| 2:37:35| and address for the record, and you have four minutes. I'm trying to get my... There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9455)|
| 2:37:43| There you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9463)|
| 2:37:44| Can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9464)|
| 2:37:44| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9464)|
| 2:37:46| Thank you, commissioners. I am Charles Taylor. I am the attorney for many of the hundreds of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9466)|

| 2:37:58| as suggested. I'm also a resident of the area. I live very close to this development. I live at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9478)|
| 2:38:03| 4801 Tazewell Pike. Some of the many neighborhood associations that have joined us in opposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9483)|
| 2:38:10| this development include Fountain City Town Hall, the Alice Bell Spring Hill Neighborhood Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9490)|
| 2:38:16| the Tazewell Pike Beverly Station Neighborhood, the Oakwood Lincoln Park Neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9496)|
| 2:38:22| and Fairmont Emeryland Neighborhood. And altogether, these organizations represent over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9502)|
| 2:38:28| 700 families who oppose and will be severely affected by this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9508)|
| 2:38:34| The track we're talking about, ladies and gentlemen, is basically a ridgeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9514)|
| 2:38:38| It's got White's Creek and a railroad on one side and Beverly Road and Greenway Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9518)|
| 2:38:44| on the other side. That track has approximately 80 acres, but only 61 acres are buildable. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9524)|
| 2:38:51| rest are in a floodway. Nothing can be built there. And this is not just a floodway by name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9531)|
| 2:38:57| It's a real floodway. If you had a chance to look at the many photographs that my neighbors and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9537)|
| 2:39:02| sent to you before this meeting, you can see some of the flooding that's taking place there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9542)|
| 2:39:07| two or three times every year. Two or three times every year, White's Creek floods Beverly Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9547)|
| 2:39:14| right at the entrance where this development is going. The only entrance to this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9554)|
| 2:39:19| has three to four feet of water. And this is three or four times a year. The flooding just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9559)|
| 2:39:25| doesn't affect White's Creek because White's Creek runs into First Creek and then it goes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9565)|
| 2:39:29| down Broadway, as you all know. And neighborhoods miles away are going to suffer from this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9569)|
| 2:39:35| Back in 2018, when the developer first proposed this project and went before the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9575)|
| 2:39:41| Commission for the very first time, Executive Director Gerald Green said, and I'm quoting him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9581)|
| 2:39:48| quote, this is the worst piece of property that has ever come before the MPC, end of quote. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9588)|
| 2:39:55| staff planner Michael Brousseau, who later left the Planning Commission and apparently is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9595)|
| 2:40:00| working as a consultant for the developer, this is what he said. He said, when you talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9600)|
| 2:40:06| rough properties, this is about as rough as a piece of property as I've ever seen, end of quote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9606)|
| 2:40:13| And because this property was so unsuitable for development, the Planning Commission in 2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9613)|
| 2:40:19| turned down the developer's request for over 200 units and instead limited it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9619)|
| 2:40:23| one unit per acre, excluding the floodway, not to exceed a maximum of 61 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9623)|
| 2:40:31| The developer then came before you, the Commission. There was a meeting in June of 2018| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9631)|
| 2:40:36| and tried to get you to ignore the Planning Commission's recommendation. But my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9636)|
| 2:40:41| and I didn't ignore it. We showed up and over a hundred of us showed up in buses and we expressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9641)|
| 2:40:47| our opposition to it. And because of that, when it became evident that you were not going to grant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9647)|
| 2:40:54| what the developer wanted, when the developer saw the writing on the wall, he withdrew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9654)|
| 2:40:59| just like he's threatening to withdraw now if you don't give him what he wants tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9659)|
| 2:41:02| but he withdrew and went home. At this point, ladies and gentlemen, and I'll stop after this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9662)|
| 2:41:07| in the summer of 2018, the developer wasn't out any money. He didn't own the property then. He only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9667)|
| 2:41:13| had an option to buy. He could have walked away and saved himself money, but he decided to gamble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9673)|
| 2:41:19| He decided he could convince you eventually to give him what he wanted. So he rolled the dice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9679)|
| 2:41:24| and he bought the property. I see my time is about, my four minutes is running out, so I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9684)|
| 2:41:30| stop for now. But this was just the first time he came before you. There's been two more additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9690)|
| 2:41:34| times, and I'll talk about those in just a minute. Okay. I'm going to give Mr. Gennard, maybe since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9694)|
| 2:41:41| they were mentioned, a member of your team up to four more minutes to sort of rebut, and then Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9701)|
| 2:41:48| Taylor, we'll hear from you again, and then I'll kind of open it up to commissioners. So Mr. Gennard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9708)|
| 2:41:53| does any member, you or your member, you're on a team, don't want to sort of respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9713)|
| 2:41:59| Well, if Chris Grangeau could just address flooding right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9719)|
| 2:42:04| If you could identify yourself and your name and address, please, for the record, Mr. Grangeau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9724)|
| 2:42:11| Yeah. Hi. Can you all hear me? Yes, sir. Excellent. Okay. Chris Grangeau, 5405 Blue Ridge Drive, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9731)|
| 2:42:17| I think the key issue to consider with flooding is that the site plans proposed is not something, it's not the typical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9737)|
| 2:42:34| site plan that has a lot of runoff in a detention pond, sort of the normal formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9754)|
| 2:42:41| What's being proposed is keeping the development out of the floodplain. It's actually more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9761)|
| 2:42:47| conservative with regard to flooding and increased runoff volumes than anything that'd be allowed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9767)|
| 2:42:54| the current zoning. So I've seen some of the photos. I'm familiar with flooding. I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9774)|
| 2:43:07| lived in Knoxville all my life. I know Dr. Smoot. He's a well-respected hydrologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9787)|
| 2:43:15| The point that I think is pertinent here is that what's being proposed is something different than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9795)|
| 2:43:21| the usual development that folks are used to seeing in Knox County. You've probably seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9801)|
| 2:43:28| the letter I wrote, so I'd be repeating that, but one thing that I didn't say in it is one of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9808)|
| 2:43:34| responsibilities at Knox County was the floodplain manager, so I was responsible for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9814)|
| 2:43:39| the county's compliance with FEMA programs and concepts and policies related to floodplain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9819)|
| 2:43:45| management. Site plans that do what is being proposed would be a dream for someone managing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9825)|
| 2:43:53| a floodplain. Them doing it voluntarily is fairly extraordinary on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9833)|
| 2:44:02| Again, staying out of the slope, staying out of the floodplain and concentrating development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9842)|
| 2:44:11| in the appropriate development areas is a new pattern. It's not something everybody's familiar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9851)|
| 2:44:17| with and you can go drive around the county and look at, but it's probably something we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9857)|
| 2:44:22| to see. Whether we see it here, whether we see it somewhere else, we're going to see this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9862)|
| 2:44:27| the pattern we're going to be seeing in the future in Knox County, so I think I'll quit at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9867)|
| 2:44:35| Thank you, Mr. Graju. Mr. Taylor, I'll look back to you and then we'll go to our commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9875)|
| 2:44:39| for questions. Mr. Taylor. Thank you. As I was saying, in 2018, a developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9879)|
| 2:44:45| failed in his first try to get this rezoned, but he went ahead and bought the property anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9885)|
| 2:44:50| even though he didn't own it then, he just had an option. He waited a year and then he came back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9890)|
| 2:44:55| December of 2019 and he once again tried to get you to change your minds and give him what he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9895)|
| 2:45:02| wanted, but once again, at the January 2020 commission meeting, over 100 of my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9902)|
| 2:45:08| and I showed up and brought buses again and we expressed our opposition and once again, it became| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9908)|
| 2:45:14| clear that you, the commission, were not going to give him what he wanted, so once again, he withdrew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9914)|
| 2:45:20| and went home, and that brings us back to now, today, the third try, and just as you've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9920)|
| 2:45:25| Mr. Winard is threatening you once more that if you don't give him what he wants, he's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9925)|
| 2:45:30| withdraw, and I really take issue with this idea that if you don't give him what he wants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9930)|
| 2:45:36| then he's going to go out there and put tires and other materials there and store them on site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9936)|
| 2:45:42| That's a threat. That's all it is, a threat, and I really take issue with this idea that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9942)|
| 2:45:47| the flooding isn't real. You know, these pictures, this is from January 3, 2020, that shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9947)|
| 2:45:53| three feet of water on Beverly Road. This is not a projection of what might happen in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9953)|
| 2:45:59| This is not a weather prediction. This is what's out there right now. That's out there where the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9959)|
| 2:46:05| rainwater now is being absorbed by the ground. Can you imagine what it's going to be like if 200 plus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9965)|
| 2:46:11| units are out there and now all that water that used to be absorbed by the ground is running off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9971)|
| 2:46:15| roads and driveways and asphalt and into White's Creek and then into First Creek and down and onto| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9975)|
| 2:46:21| Broadway? That's what's going to happen, and not only are the people downstream going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9981)|
| 2:46:27| adversely affected, the people in the neighborhood are going to be affected. You know, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9987)|
| 2:46:32| this is the only entrance to that neighborhood. That means that two or three times a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9992)|
| 2:46:37| the people who live in that neighborhood are going to be marooned. They can't get in or out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=9997)|
| 2:46:43| If their house catches on fire, a fire truck can't get to them. If they have a medical emergency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10003)|
| 2:46:48| an ambulance can't get to them. Mothers are not going to be able to go pick up their kids from school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10008)|
| 2:46:54| because of the flooding. With all respect, ladies and gentlemen, the planning commission was correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10014)|
| 2:47:00| back in 2018. This is the worst piece of property to come before the NPC. My neighbors and I are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10020)|
| 2:47:07| willing to compromise. If you feel like that some residential development is permissible on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10027)|
| 2:47:14| property, then please go back to what the planning commission did in 2018 and allow a density of only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10034)|
| 2:47:21| one dwelling unit per acre, excluding the floodway, which means a maximum of 61 units. If you will do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10041)|
| 2:47:29| that, then we'll live with it. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. I'll open the questions up for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10049)|
| 2:47:35| commissioners first. I'll look to the commission district representative first, unless you'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10055)|
| 2:47:41| to defer, Ms. Durrett. Sure, we can. I'll defer to other commissioners for questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10061)|
| 2:47:48| Commissioner Beeler, I see your hand up first. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I guess probably this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10068)|
| 2:47:55| question is maybe for Mr. Gennard or a member of his team. With respect to both sides, I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10075)|
| 2:48:02| very obvious to everybody that if nothing is done to this property, it floods, as it is. It clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10082)|
| 2:48:10| floods. Sometimes it floods very badly. And so I guess, and forgive me if Mr. Grungew addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10090)|
| 2:48:19| this and my layman's ear didn't catch it as well as I should have, but what is the plan or is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10099)|
| 2:48:25| any plan to potentially improve the flooding propensity of this property if it is developed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10105)|
| 2:48:33| in the way that Mr. Gennard and his team intend to develop it? And I'll wait for your response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10113)|
| 2:48:43| You're on mute, Mr. Gennard or Mr. Grungew, whoever wants to take that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10123)|
| 2:48:48| Okay. Yeah, I'll see if I can take that. It sounded like it had to do with hydrology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10128)|
| 2:48:56| Well, a couple things. One is, when you're looking at land development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10136)|
| 2:49:03| land development isn't going to prevent flooding. Those photos of flooding on First Creek and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10143)|
| 2:49:09| White's Creek, you can save the fuel and just change the dates on them. Because when we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10149)|
| 2:49:19| extreme rainfall events, especially when they're on the heels of heavy rainfall seasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10159)|
| 2:49:26| we're going to have flooding. It's just, it's the nature of where we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10166)|
| 2:49:31| A good development is a development that does no harm. So, it's going to be a development that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10171)|
| 2:49:37| going to not add a flood risk. And I think that was what the designer was charged with on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10177)|
| 2:49:45| is how do you take this really difficult piece of land and do a design where you do no harm?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10185)|
| 2:49:51| Well, what he did was look at techniques of infiltration. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10191)|
| 2:49:57| you're right, you're adding hard surfaces. There's no way to build dwellings humans live in without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10197)|
| 2:50:03| them having hard surfaces. But there are opportunities to infiltrate and infiltrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10203)|
| 2:50:07| in areas that don't already infiltrate. In other words, outside or above the floodplain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10207)|
| 2:50:13| basically in a soil sense, when you look at hydrology. And that's what the designer is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10213)|
| 2:50:18| And that's why earlier, I didn't go into the detail of why. But I said, this is an innovative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10218)|
| 2:50:23| approach. It's a new concept that, you know, whether it goes now or goes a year from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10223)|
| 2:50:29| it's going to be what we're seeing, what we see in Knox County. And it's the best approach for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10229)|
| 2:50:37| this area. So, will it prevent flooding? No, nothing's going to prevent flooding that any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10237)|
| 2:50:42| individual will do on a piece of land that size. But asking it to not create a flood risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10242)|
| 2:50:50| but asking it to not create an additional flood risk is a very realistic goal, realistic request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10250)|
| 2:51:01| Commissioner Bailey, is that? Yes, that's all for now. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10261)|
| 2:51:05| Okay. Thank you, Commissioner Biggs. Thank you, Chairman Jay. I have a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10265)|
| 2:51:09| for Jim Snowden, please. Yes, go ahead, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10269)|
| 2:51:16| Director Snowden, how are you? I'm all right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10276)|
| 2:51:21| I was looking at the map and where we have the apartment complex and housing units and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10281)|
| 2:51:28| things of that nature. Can you tell me a little bit more where on this, I guess, is designated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10288)|
| 2:51:34| maybe RB, the hilltop and slope protection program, as well as the grading and things of that nature?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10294)|
| 2:51:42| Yes, Commissioner Biggs. And I think in the packet that Amy's folks have put together kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10302)|
| 2:51:49| of shows a little bit of that. There's a slope and hillside analysis sheet. If you can see kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10309)|
| 2:51:55| of the primary area that is zoned RB is contained within the 25 to 40 and greater than 40 percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10315)|
| 2:52:05| slope. Looks like there's probably in the neighborhood of about 28 acres there. So the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10325)|
| 2:52:12| bulk of the RB zone property on Mr. Grenard's property appears to be within the slope and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10332)|
| 2:52:20| hillside protection. Now, keep in mind that that is advisory in the county, not mandatory, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10340)|
| 2:52:26| the bulk of where the RB property is does appear to lie within the steeper slope area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10346)|
| 2:52:33| Okay. So does this road, whenever to gain entrance into this development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10353)|
| 2:52:45| is it a county road or is it a city road? It is a city street. The property is in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10365)|
| 2:52:54| but the Greenway Drive at that location is a city street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10374)|
| 2:52:58| Okay. I'm going to jot some stuff down and I'll come back. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10378)|
| 2:53:06| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs. Commissioner Bussler, you're up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10386)|
| 2:53:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Back in 1992, there was a plan made and it was almost it was approved by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10389)|
| 2:53:18| MPC because I was on MPC when it did to help mitigate the water runoff. There was a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10398)|
| 2:53:26| of the community came up and just got really requested, made it political and it did not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10406)|
| 2:53:35| There was another issue came up later on that could have made it better, won't stop the flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10415)|
| 2:53:42| but lessen the damage that the flooding would do. And the people in the community that weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10422)|
| 2:53:47| living right there on it. And again, there is a industrial steel plant that's right there next to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10427)|
| 2:53:55| it. They decided not to do anything for it back then. So in the early 90s, there were plans made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10435)|

| 2:54:18| mitigate some of that. But in plan residential, the developer has to address the issue of getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10458)|

| 2:54:50| and it will flood. Yes, you won't be able to cross that road sometimes. But if we do something now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10490)|
| 2:54:56| we can lessen that issue of flooding in that area. And plans have come about and with plan residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210222b?start=10496)|
