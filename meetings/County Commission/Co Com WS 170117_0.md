| 0:10:20| working to make this a much better deal and a safer deal for the county and the taxpayer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=620)|
| 0:10:27| and also Mr. Chesney for being willing to work with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=627)|
| 0:10:34| Motion properly before us and seeing no further discussion, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=634)|
| 0:10:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=638)|
| 0:10:39| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=640)|
| 0:10:41| Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=641)|
| 0:10:42| Page 7, item number 26, Resolution 701.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=642)|
| 0:10:49| It's approving a lease agreement with River Sports Outfitters, Incorporated for the operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| of outfitter services at the Colbert Concord Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=653)|
| 0:10:58| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=658)|
| 0:10:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| I'd like to ask Doug Battelle to come forward and have a couple of quick questions for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=667)|
| 0:11:09| Doug Battelle, Knox County Parks and Recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=669)|
| 0:11:17| River Sports Outfitters is the current firm under contract and they've had it for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=677)|
| 0:11:23| last five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| You can just kind of briefly explain that that was a contract based on just the rentals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=685)|
| 0:11:34| of the boats at the cove, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=697)|
| 0:11:38| It was just a services contract, so it was running canoes, kayaks, paddle boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=698)|
| 0:11:43| Food service was an option within the contract, but again, more of an option within it as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| opposed to a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| And then this past year they had how much in revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| I think the total gross revenue was just a little under $100,000 and we got 5% of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=715)|
| 0:12:04| Based on the five-year contract, they filled all of their obligations to Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=724)|
| 0:12:10| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=730)|
| 0:12:11| And then on the new contract, there was three proposals for outfitter services at the cove.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=731)|
| 0:12:20| Did one outfitter excel as far as what the plan of service was and what they were going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=740)|
| 0:12:30| to offer Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Do you mind to elaborate just a little bit about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| Sure, and I don't have the scoring in front of me, so I won't get real specific here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=756)|
| 0:12:41| but in general, the three proposals gave us their packages and we scored, I believe it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| was five categories, having to do with both the program, proposed improvements, and their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=766)|
| 0:12:52| finances and revenue to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| Yeah, when you look at the top two, one proposal did very good on the program and the improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=775)|
| 0:13:02| to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| The other proposal excelled in the financial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=783)|
| 0:13:07| So again, a very close race, very good competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=787)|
| 0:13:10| That's just the way the scoring came out on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| Okay, and then the two firms had two different fees that they were going to return to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| county based on sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Could you tell us what those amounts were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=800)|
| 0:13:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=802)|
| 0:13:23| The top proposal was 10% of gross revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| The second proposal was 6% of gross revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=806)|
| 0:13:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=809)|
| 0:13:30| Did you have any questions at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| I was going to defer to Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=819)|
| 0:13:41| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=821)|
| 0:13:42| Doug, is it possible for us to get the old contract for the past five years so we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| have that for a reference, and then was there any audience done for River Sports in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=826)|
| 0:13:52| last five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| I don't believe there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| I think within the contract, we had the right to require that, but typically we don't do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| that unless there's a question about something, but again, I'd want to go back and read that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| contract to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| I showed Commissioner Schoonemaker what we really did with this new contract is take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=847)|
| 0:14:11| the old one and revise it with new requirements, so the new requirements really are about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=851)|
| 0:14:15| improvements to the facility, and there's benchmarks in there that River Sports will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=855)|
| 0:14:20| have to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=860)|
| 0:14:21| If they don't meet them, we can terminate the contract then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=861)|
| 0:14:26| If you would, check and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| I'd like to have all commissioners have a copy of the old contract, and of course we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=867)|
| 0:14:30| got the new one, but I also would like to see, make sure that there was no audit done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| because I think there's a question that has been presented of whether total sales have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| I don't know if that can be done or not, so if you would look for that and let us know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=882)|
| 0:14:47| next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=889)|
| 0:14:50| Yes, Mr. Patel, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=890)|
| 0:14:58| Do we have any kind of liability risk with them renting their product?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=898)|
| 0:15:05| Yes, sir, well, the contractors required to provide liability insurance, so those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| all the requirements set by purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| I think any time we have any contractor operating in the park, and I'd want to defer law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| but we still obviously have liability as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=919)|
| 0:15:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=923)|
| 0:15:25| Commissioner Schoonemaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| If anybody had a question for Doug, I'll go ahead and defer, and then come back to somebody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| I think earlier you had mentioned they had just finished a five-year contract, and this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| new contract is set for ten with an option to renew for another ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=938)|
| 0:15:41| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=941)|
| 0:15:42| If you could clarify, just for the sake of our team, why the move from a five-year to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=942)|
| 0:15:47| a ten-year contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| Yes, sir, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| The old contract, again, was just services, providing services, essentially for canoes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=949)|
| 0:15:57| kayaks, paddle boats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=957)|
| 0:15:59| The new contract, we were looking for the contractor to come in and make capital investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=959)|
| 0:16:04| The top two proposals were well over $100,000 in improvements, so again, in exchange for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=964)|
| 0:16:10| that capital investment, the longer-term contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=970)|
| 0:16:14| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| I wanted to talk to Perry for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| Thank you, Doug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=983)|
| 0:16:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| Hello, Perry Benshoff, 400 Main Street, Knox County Finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=985)|
| 0:16:40| Thanks, Perry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| In our discussions earlier, you were charged with going through the financials of all three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1001)|
| 0:16:49| of the bidders for this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1009)|
| 0:16:53| Is there a difference between the top one, the one that won the contract, and the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1013)|
| 0:16:58| one in line?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1018)|
| 0:17:01| Yes, and what I was explaining to you a little bit earlier, and hopefully this will make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1021)|
| 0:17:08| a little more sense, what we do when I take a look at the financials section of any type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1028)|
| 0:17:14| of bidding process, I just take a look at various ratios, financial ratios, profitability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| ratios, and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| And that way, we can kind of compare apples to apples for companies that are larger and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| smaller to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| And just by doing that, it was pretty clear that one was just more financially stable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1049)|
| 0:17:38| So that's how we did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1059)|
| 0:17:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| Commissioner Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1065)|
| 0:17:47| Commissioner Schoonmaker-Perry should be on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1067)|
| 0:17:49| I was just going to say that when we conclude our discussion, I'm going to make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1069)|
| 0:17:53| to move this with no recommendation, because I have not had a chance to sit down with Matt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1078)|
| 0:17:59| We've been playing some telephone tag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| And also to sit down with Doug on a couple other questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| I'll entertain that motion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| Well, does he, since we have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1086)|
| 0:18:09| We'll continue discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1089)|
| 0:18:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1091)|
| 0:18:12| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1092)|
| 0:18:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1093)|
| 0:18:14| Continuing discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1094)|
| 0:18:15| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| One more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| I think we've all gotten calls from one of the losing bidders that feels like they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1099)|
| 0:18:25| not treated fairly, I guess, is the only way to describe it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| So I want to make sure we do, I told him to come up here next week if he wants to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| something that would be informative to us, that he should do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1117)|
| 0:18:40| So I want to make sure we do give him that opportunity and pass this with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1120)|
| 0:18:46| so we can just clear the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1126)|
| 0:18:52| Seeing no further discussion, the motion that is properly before us is to send to full commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1132)|
| 0:18:57| no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1141)|
| 0:19:02| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1142)|
| 0:19:04| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| Madam Clerk, I think we're down to the, there are like four spreads of record, but I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1148)|
| 0:19:11| to pause for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1151)|
| 0:19:14| I believe I saw just a moment ago the Honorable Mayor of Knox County, Mr. Tim Burchett, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1154)|
| 0:19:20| he still present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| I see him waving to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| Mayor Burchett, would you like to have a word or are you just going to wave at us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1164)|
| 0:19:31| Also while he's approaching the podium, the Knox County Clerk is also in attendance, Foster| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1171)|

| 0:28:11| gotten one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1691)|

| 0:28:21| to try to get a hold of this and get our teenagers and all who do have an addiction to help them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1701)|

| 0:29:08| the conversion over to the new LED lights as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1748)|

| 0:29:18| appreciate it out in southwest Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1758)|

| 0:29:31| with several different scout groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1771)|
| 0:29:33| The Webelos level of scouting, before they cross over to become full Boy Scouts, one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1773)|
| 0:29:38| of their requirements is to meet with a community or government leader and learn about governmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1778)|
| 0:29:43| problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1783)|

| 0:29:56| six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1796)|
| 0:29:57| I'm going to try to make that more of a bigger deal in future years so that perhaps we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1797)|
| 0:30:02| coordinate that with multiple regions of scouting in our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoComWS170117?start=1802)|
