| 0:05:45| and thank you for this looks like very concise report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=345)|
| 0:05:48| Oh, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| Drusilla has been so kind to put me up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=351)|
| 0:05:53| It feels like every February or March or January we're talking about some natural disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=353)|
| 0:05:59| We've had floods in 19 and 20, snows in 22, so I'm not sure what's going to be next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=359)|
| 0:06:04| but we'll give it a shot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=364)|
| 0:06:05| But I did want to update you all, appreciate the consideration last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| just coming off the heels of this event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=369)|
| 0:06:11| Worked at the county 25 years and never have seen anything quite like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=371)|
| 0:06:16| Obviously, what happened, you know, that Friday, or pardon me, that Sunday and Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=376)|
| 0:06:23| which was Martin Luther King Day, it snowed 10 inches in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=383)|
| 0:06:27| and it was followed by temperatures that didn't get above freezing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=387)|
| 0:06:31| The lows, you know, in the zeros, not five, eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| for a weekly average of 11 degrees for the next eight days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| So a lot of folks obviously, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=400)|
| 0:06:43| were accustomed to kind of seeing the temperatures rise up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=403)|
| 0:06:46| and our crews really making a lot more headway and getting the roads clear in a more prompt fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| but we weren't able to necessarily do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=410)|
| 0:06:52| But that speaks a little bit to why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=412)|
| 0:06:55| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=415)|
| 0:06:56| And I wanted to put this kind of together for comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| Kind of the last decent snow we had was Christmas Day, actually, 2020.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=420)|
| 0:07:06| We got four inches that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=426)|
| 0:07:09| But thankfully, the following low temperatures were all above freezing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=429)|
| 0:07:14| So that made my staff's job a lot easier to be able to get out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=434)|
| 0:07:19| and get those roads clear in a timely fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=439)|
| 0:07:23| So I actually looked, went back to 93.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=443)|
| 0:07:26| You know, that's the snowstorm that everybody kind of correlates with this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=446)|
| 0:07:29| Obviously, we got 15 inches of snow in March 12th and 13th, 1993.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| But if you'll look, there was some cold temperatures immediately after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=454)|
| 0:07:38| But then, you know, within a few days, it got above freezing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=458)|
| 0:07:42| and somewhat kind of stayed above freezing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=462)|
| 0:07:44| So, you know, technically this snowstorm, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=464)|
| 0:07:47| was probably the worst one we've had in this community in a long, long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| My guys worked really hard, but unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=471)|
| 0:07:54| sometimes didn't see the results on the road conditions that we'd have liked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=474)|
| 0:07:58| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=478)|
| 0:08:00| It kind of speaks to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=480)|
| 0:08:02| What we see is what happened was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| temperatures those days got to about freezing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=485)|
| 0:08:07| Sun would come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=487)|
| 0:08:09| It would kind of melt that first few inches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=489)|
| 0:08:12| Obviously, folks were still getting out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=492)|
| 0:08:14| Traffic was on those roads, and it packed them down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=494)|
| 0:08:16| And then it got to, you know, zero and five and nine that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| And it created essentially a layer of ice on every county roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=500)|
| 0:08:24| Next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=504)|
| 0:08:26| And this, this is in District 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=506)|
| 0:08:29| This is taken on Steel Road by myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=509)|
| 0:08:31| As you can see, cross-sectional view there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=511)|
| 0:08:34| It was five inches of ice on Steel Road right in front of the elementary school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=514)|
| 0:08:38| Tried to plow it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=518)|
| 0:08:40| It wouldn't come off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=520)|
| 0:08:42| We would salt it, plow it, salt it, plow it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| And it was just an iterative process that, unfortunately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=525)|
| 0:08:49| resulted in just a lot of challenges for my guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| But I did want to kind of show that it's just kind of what ultimately we were dealing with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=532)|
| 0:08:57| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| These next couple of slides just speak to the conditions that we were dealing in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| You can see we had a couple of trucks off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=544)|
| 0:09:07| This particular slide here, taken in Commissioner Daley's end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=547)|
| 0:09:12| sent two of our truck drivers to the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=552)|
| 0:09:15| And this was actually, I think this was on Thursday of that week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| so this was four or five days after the snow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=559)|
| 0:09:21| So, obviously, there was still a lot of treacherous road conditions in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=561)|
| 0:09:26| Guys were trying as hard as they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| But, unfortunately, like I said, just a lot of ice out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=568)|
| 0:09:32| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=572)|
| 0:09:34| This is a good in case on Washington Pike in Commissioner Beeler's end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| You can see the truck in front of us there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| It's a brine truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| We typically apply brine in a pretreatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| But one of the things we kind of learned from this storm was the brine actually started to break down the ice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=587)|
| 0:09:54| quicker than the granular salt would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| So what we did here was we tagged up trucks with a plow on the front, brine in the back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=596)|
| 0:10:02| and then another plow behind it to try to stage that effort to try to get it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| And as you can see, that lane coming back the other direction is we had done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=607)|
| 0:10:11| So even under those efforts, we were still challenged with a lot of issues there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=611)|
| 0:10:17| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| These are just some statistics as far as kind of what we used and how we used them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=619)|
| 0:10:25| We have about 103 people in public works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=625)|
| 0:10:28| That includes shop employees that performed admirably, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=628)|
| 0:10:34| because, obviously, when you have this kind of event, you're running trucks 24-7 for eight days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=634)|
| 0:10:39| You have a lot of equipment breaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| So about 90 of those people are what you would consider to be public works,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| probably about 13 are in the garage making sure those trucks work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| The average overtime premium pay was 160 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| So that just goes to show you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| I'll get into a little bit of cost later on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| but this will just kind of give you an idea of the kind of man hours we put forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| We used 75,000 gallons of brine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| We got the water bill from KUB this week, and it's normally about $300 for our facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=668)|
| 0:11:14| It was over $6,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| So it just shows you how much brine we made and applied on the streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| We have about 26 trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=681)|
| 0:11:23| Some of those are dump trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| Some are pickup trucks with salt sprayers and plows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=685)|
| 0:11:29| We got with our phone system and, look, we had over 15,000 calls for service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| We eventually got to every one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=694)|
| 0:11:36| Now, obviously it may have took us a little longer than a lot of folks would have liked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| but we did get on each one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| And we have GPS on all our trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| So we looked, and I did a mileage comparison of all our trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=703)|
| 0:11:48| So we did a total of 48,000 miles driven in this week's time, a little over a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=708)|
| 0:11:55| So those 26 trucks, divide that up, essentially that's every truck going to Miami and back around trip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=715)|
| 0:12:02| So we were out there trying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=722)|
| 0:12:04| We tried a lot, but unfortunately it didn't really result in, you know, it didn't look like we were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| And this is kind of the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=731)|
| 0:12:14| Chris Caldwell said I could spend a million dollars quicker than anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=734)|
| 0:12:18| So we did spend pretty close to a million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| And, like I said, 1,500 man hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| Half of that was in overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| So we got the overtime log for the last pay period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| and in two weeks' time we expended $195,000 in premium pays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| That's above and beyond the regular pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| Obviously, you know, a lot of gas, diesel used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=758)|
| 0:12:42| Speak to those repairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=762)|
| 0:12:43| We repaired 162 specific items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| We used 3,000 tons of salt, which at 128 tons values almost $400,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=767)|
| 0:12:54| There's the water bill we previously discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| And ultimately, in about a week's time, the county spent $700,000 in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| trying to get the roads in as good a safe condition as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| Next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| And this just gives you kind of scope and scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=789)|
| 0:13:12| This is our salt shed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| This is the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| We had made some brine that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| So you could see there was a little bit taken out of the left in the center bin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| but that was the salt supply when we started the snow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=800)|
| 0:13:25| And next slide shows the slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| That is after the snow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| And I was going to take another picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=810)|
| 0:13:33| The shed now is fuller than the first picture because, as I told the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| running out of salt is a career-ending decision for a public works director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| so we're not going to run out of salt for the next storm event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=822)|
| 0:13:45| So if it does snow again, the county salt supply is ample.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=825)|
| 0:13:51| And, you know, next slide, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| Okay, well, what did we learn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=834)|
| 0:13:55| What can we improve upon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| Because that's one of the things we always want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=836)|
| 0:13:58| We want to take these challenges and come out of them with a better fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=838)|
| 0:14:05| And one of the things we noticed was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=845)|
| 0:14:07| we spoke a little bit about the brine and the calcium chloride| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| breaking the ice better than the salt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=850)|
| 0:14:12| And in addition to that, that brine dilutes at about a 25% reduction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=852)|
| 0:14:17| so we use essentially 75% less cost with more effectiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=857)|
| 0:14:21| So that's one of the things we'll probably use next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| We have revised our snow routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| One of the things we looked at is we haven't had snow like this in a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=866)|
| 0:14:30| so a lot of our routes maybe need to be revised based on current traffic conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=870)|
| 0:14:36| And then one of the things we are going to look and do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| have a little bit of expense about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=878)|
| 0:14:40| is typically we don't get our larger dump trucks out after the snow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| We brine with them before, but we don't get them out because typically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=885)|
| 0:14:49| they're a lot bigger trucks and a lot of our roads are very narrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=889)|
| 0:14:52| but we are going to buy some equipment for them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=892)|
| 0:14:55| and get those trucks out on the roads like Cedar Bluff and Dry Gap Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=895)|
| 0:14:59| the bigger roads, to just provide a little more redundancy in our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| So we're still obviously trying to digest it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| but those are some of the few brief things that we think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| we might could do better next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| And obviously, you know, I want to commend my guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| They worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=916)|
| 0:15:17| We had folks on the clock consistently for over eight days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=917)|
| 0:15:21| and they did great work, and like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=921)|
| 0:15:24| I'm thankful to be in a position to work with those guys every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| So I'd be happy to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| My last slide is just, I think, a question slide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=930)|
| 0:15:32| so I'd be happy to entertain any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| I just appreciate your all support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=938)|
| 0:15:40| I will call on you all, but I have to be first to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=940)|
| 0:15:45| I thought that you all did a remarkable job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| It was truly thankless, and I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| All of us were receiving a lot of phone calls, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| but without question, we know that you and your staff just knocked themselves out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=957)|
| 0:16:02| So that is greatly, greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=967)|
| 0:16:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Ditto what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=971)|
| 0:16:14| Jim, thanks to all the guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=974)|
| 0:16:15| Do you have any gals?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=975)|
| 0:16:18| We actually do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=978)|
| 0:16:19| We have one lady that this was like her second or third week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=979)|
| 0:16:25| and she's still with us, which is kind of surprising.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| But, yeah, she was second week on the job and got to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| Update on the two drivers out in South 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| They okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| They're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| They're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| He had a little banged up shoulder, but he's out of the brace now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=999)|
| 0:16:42| and everybody's in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| So we were very fortunate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1004)|
| 0:16:46| And, actually, all the trucks you saw that were damaged,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1006)|
| 0:16:48| none of those repairs were significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| So we were very, very lucky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1011)|
| 0:16:53| And last request is can we get the revised snow routes as soon as you can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1013)|
| 0:17:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| We'll have them emailed out to you tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1022)|
| 0:17:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| Mr. Snowden, what did you learn about the communications side of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| Because I think some people tried to call directly to the engineering department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1034)|
| 0:17:18| Some people tried to call a hotline, which I was never understanding which was which.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1038)|
| 0:17:23| And some people called us, and some people called the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| I mean, from a broader, if this happens again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1045)|
| 0:17:29| what would you do different from a constituent communication standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1049)|
| 0:17:33| to be able to route all of those requests instead of having 37 sources come at you 24-7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1053)|
| 0:17:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| And I think, for us, electronic communication just makes it a little easier to track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1061)|
| 0:17:46| I mean, I was up there, and you couldn't imagine the phone calls that we were trying to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| And we have one line into our shop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1071)|
| 0:17:53| So he was on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1073)|
| 0:17:55| There were messages leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| He continually had to go in and check the messages to clear them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| because then they would become full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1080)|
| 0:18:02| For me, I think we would, and we do have a general EPW operations e-mail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1082)|
| 0:18:09| We may, the next time this happens, push that out a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1089)|
| 0:18:12| just to make sure that we get those requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1092)|
| 0:18:15| because certainly we want to get each one of them codified and responded to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1095)|
| 0:18:19| And sometimes that phone call is just very hard to manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1099)|
| 0:18:22| I would love for your team to be thinking about how, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1102)|
| 0:18:27| could we do a better central system or some other way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| There will be another snow event,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| but there may be another natural disaster event like our tornado situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1113)|
| 0:18:36| There may be other ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Just how can we do that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| And then one of the issues I ran into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1119)|
| 0:18:42| although the routes were really based on traffic loads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| and, you know, some of our major arteries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1126)|
| 0:18:50| were neighborhoods that, you know, there's not many flat places in all of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1130)|
| 0:18:55| but there are probably at least two or three dozen neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| that essentially, you know, enter and exit on a really, really steep hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1139)|
| 0:19:04| and those were on the third or fourth or fifth rung.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| And so you had entire neighborhoods that were just locked in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1149)|
| 0:19:14| because if you even attempted to go in or out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1154)|
| 0:19:17| one of them was up off Cunningham Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| If you had attempted to exit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| you'd literally be in the ditch on the other side of Cunningham Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| On the north side, same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| In the River Bend area, there were Glen Cove and a few others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| that you would literally be down in the next ravine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| I would love some consideration from the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| to maybe look at where are those steepest entrance and exits neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| and maybe add those up to a higher priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| because it is so dangerous to even attempt to getting it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1182)|
| 0:19:45| versus some of the other neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| which obviously can just, you know, take a little time and be more patient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1187)|
| 0:19:50| And that's funny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| We've actually, and I would assume that's Reddidge out on Cunningham Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1195)|
| 0:19:56| It's very, very steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1196)|
| 0:19:57| We've actually done some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1197)|
| 0:19:59| Certainly, we'll look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1199)|
| 0:20:00| But if you'll notice, and we can highlight some of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1200)|
| 0:20:03| some of those areas have been moved up to priority two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1203)|
| 0:20:07| due to the fact that they are just so steep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1207)|
| 0:20:09| So, you know, there's one off of, I guess, High Vista| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| out in the Hardin Valley community off of Gwinn Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1213)|
| 0:20:16| I mean, it's kind of a hazard to drive in the dry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| let alone in the wet, you know, snow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| So, yes, we have done some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| And certainly, if anybody in their, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1224)|
| 0:20:26| commissioner has certain ones in their district that are like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1226)|
| 0:20:28| we can certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| Thank you for the hard work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| Appreciate you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1230)|
| 0:20:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Again, we do appreciate everything your team did for us during that event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1234)|
| 0:20:39| It was pretty incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| In conversations with constituents that were concerned about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1241)|
| 0:20:46| equipment and where it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| I explained to them that you have a snow plan with dedicated equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1249)|
| 0:20:53| to different areas of town and that it's not all in south Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| or not all in east Knoxville or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1258)|
| 0:21:01| And then I think in conversations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1261)|
| 0:21:03| they were also impressed that how hard our employees worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1263)|
| 0:21:07| when I related that the truck that went into the ditch in my district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| at 930 at night on a Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| And when I told people that, they were like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1275)|
| 0:21:17| oh, you mean they just didn't go home at dark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1277)|
| 0:21:19| I go, no, they were out there trying to do what they could do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| to make it better for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1283)|
| 0:21:26| And then some people said, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| why can't you just have all this equipment there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1287)|
| 0:21:30| And when you start to look at it, you can't have snow equipment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1290)|
| 0:21:35| and put it in a warehouse and keep it there for an event like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1295)|
| 0:21:38| that may not come for another 10 or 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| You can't make the capital expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1301)|
| 0:21:43| And then finally, after you kind of talked them through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| it made sense to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| But I think you guys did, with what the personnel and the equipment you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1308)|
| 0:21:53| and the supplies, I think you guys did just a fantastic and phenomenal job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1313)|
| 0:21:59| and we do appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1319)|
| 0:22:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| Commissioner Oster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| I'm going to echo some of the other comments that were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| Sometimes people think out in West Knox, well, we don't have bad roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| and they didn't come down Bob Gray or Sanders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| or some that we talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| And I appreciate you moving some of them up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| and you know I'll probably have some neighborhoods to add to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1343)|
| 0:22:25| because they're like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1345)|
| 0:22:28| We do have a lot of new people in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| and they've come from maybe other areas of the country| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| that are used to this on a monthly basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| And so I made sure to let them know that this is unusual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1358)|
| 0:22:42| and we're not going to park 26 more trucks on top of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| for something that's going to happen in 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| I think, and you've probably heard from every commissioner up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1369)|
| 0:22:52| but I want to say it publicly, not that I've not said it to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| but you guys did a phenomenal job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| And I don't think, as hard as our jobs can be sometimes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| as many people as we heard from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| there was not one of us that was thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1385)|
| 0:23:07| that we wanted to be Jim Snowden that week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1387)|
| 0:23:11| And so just for your leadership is so appreciated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1391)|
| 0:23:18| because it helps our jobs so much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1398)|
| 0:23:21| to be able to get information out to constituents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1401)|
| 0:23:24| And for your guys to go out there and risk their lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| which I don't think sometimes people are thinking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| that it's as dangerous for them out in those big trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1411)|
| 0:23:34| brawling in the roads as it was for anybody else to try to get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| So I just, I don't think there's probably enough thank yous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| and gratitude for you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| but I sure hope you feel it from all of us sitting up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1423)|
| 0:23:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1427)|
| 0:23:51| Seeing no light, oh, I'm sorry, Commissioner Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1431)|
| 0:23:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| Forgive me, Mayor Jacobs, for just a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| but I got to say I think Director Snowden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| is the hardest working man in all of Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| Honest to gosh, this guy right here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| you led us with an immense amount of integrity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| through a very challenging situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| This is a weather incident that no one really predicted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| And the way that you and your team and this county responded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| is something that I'm tremendously proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1463)|
| 0:24:26| And I'm grateful that you are in the position you are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| and that you lead with such a respect for both your team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1470)|
| 0:24:38| for everyone you work with, and our constituents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1483)|
| 0:24:45| You treat them like they're your family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1485)|
| 0:24:48| And, you know, as a former HR person, I'm like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| you know, you can teach people skills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| but you can't teach them with some of the characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1493)|
| 0:24:57| that you have, and we are just so fortunate to have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1497)|
| 0:25:02| I'm going to follow that with a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1502)|
| 0:25:05| Do you think that because of, I mean, I agree with most,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1505)|
| 0:25:10| I mean, my colleagues when they say that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1510)|
| 0:25:13| we got phone calls about materials and resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| and equipment, and we do have adequate resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| and equipment for the weather that we have here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1519)|
| 0:25:23| in this part of East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1523)|
| 0:25:27| In the event that it happens again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1527)|
| 0:25:30| do you think that possibly we could look at maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| some sort of contractual agreement in the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1534)|
| 0:25:38| that we do need more staff or more equipment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1538)|
| 0:25:40| Is that something that you think we should consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| or because this happens so rarely?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| But, you know, I know that other counties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| they're not as fortunate as we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| They don't have 26 trucks and the staff and the resources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1551)|
| 0:25:57| and they do have contractual relationships with folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| who can come in and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1560)|
| 0:26:01| So do you think that's something we should consider?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1561)|
| 0:26:03| It's something we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1563)|
| 0:26:05| One of the things actually we even talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1565)|
| 0:26:07| and engaged a little bit with TDOT is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1567)|
| 0:26:11| TDOT obviously has a lot fewer roads,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1571)|
| 0:26:13| and the roads that they do have are a lot easier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| to plow than ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| So they got their roads clear prior to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| I'm talking to them and looking at the potential to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1580)|
| 0:26:25| if we did have an event like this occur,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1585)|
| 0:26:27| maybe some kind of interlocal government agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1587)|
| 0:26:29| to where TDOT could come and help us as an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| I think the contracted service industry in this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| wouldn't necessarily be very effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| because they're more set up for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1599)|
| 0:26:40| parking lots and things, but I think that TDOT option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1600)|
| 0:26:43| is something we could explore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1603)|
| 0:26:45| That's a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| That we're kind of talking to them about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| Appreciate your kind words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| Seeing no other lights, thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| Thank you so much, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| You're greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| My guys did all the hard work, so thanks to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1618)|
| 0:27:04| Our next item is the approval of minutes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1624)|
| 0:27:06| from the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1626)|
| 0:27:08| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| Motion by Daly, second by Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1630)|
| 0:27:13| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| Madam Clerk has reminded me technically we don't have any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1635)|
| 0:27:19| because we did not have our workshop last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| so we did approve 12.11 and 12.18 at the January meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1642)|
| 0:27:29| So having said that, just strike the call for the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1649)|
| 0:27:38| Next item is consideration of the acceptance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| Next item is consideration of the acceptance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1661)|
| 0:27:43| of New County Roads, A. Edwards Place Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1663)|
| 0:27:57| Next item is public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| No problem, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1681)|
| 0:28:02| You're doing a wonderful job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1682)|
| 0:28:06| We have two speakers signed up to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| specifically an agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| They both are speaking on the same item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| so they'll each have three minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| First one down is Kevin Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| If you come forward, please, and give us your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1703)|
| 0:28:33| Okay, that's a magic button to get this to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1713)|
| 0:28:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Kevin Murphy, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| I'm speaking on item 32, the growth plan that's in front of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| There's two dominant themes from advanced Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| and public input surveys that came out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1725)|
| 0:28:49| One, a need or desire for more housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| and two is the value of rural character farmland| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1732)|
| 0:28:55| and open spaces, and both of these compete for land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1735)|
| 0:28:59| The draft growth plan and comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1739)|
| 0:29:01| they deliver on the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| They give more area for growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| and they allow more uses in those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| But I don't think they deliver quite on the second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| in terms of keeping rural character, natural spaces, and farmland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| And here's why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| The draft growth plan, it does in the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| reduce the density from three units to two units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1759)|
| 0:29:22| and we've been told that will make development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1762)|
| 0:29:24| less likely and less financial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| But next month, Smithville will be in front of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| telling you they can make two units work in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| And so by itself, that reduction in density in the rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| probably isn't going to reserve that all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| for natural areas and rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| So next we turn to the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| It has some encouraging words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| It has a goal of conservation, a goal of community character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1786)|
| 0:29:50| It has policies that state, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1790)|
| 0:29:53| ensure development is sensitive to existing community character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| and encourage development practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1796)|
| 0:29:58| that can serve and connect natural features and habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1798)|
| 0:30:00| And these do capture the sentiment of public feedback,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1800)|
| 0:30:03| but they aren't legally binding requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1803)|
| 0:30:06| I sat in a courtroom recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| where the law director successfully argued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1809)|
| 0:30:11| that the current general plan and sector plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1811)|
| 0:30:13| are advisory in intent and they aren't rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| The judge noted that since the word requirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1816)|
| 0:30:19| isn't used in the area we're looking at in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| that it wasn't a firm requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| So that got my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1827)|
| 0:30:29| Our new plan is toothless if it doesn't use the terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1829)|
| 0:30:32| shall and require, and those aren't terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1832)|
| 0:30:34| that you really find in the new draft plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1834)|
| 0:30:37| For over 20 years, the community's advocated for rural character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| The 2003 general plan calls for prime and agricultural land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1841)|
| 0:30:44| to be protected for continued farm use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| The sector plans and East Knox community plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1846)|
| 0:30:49| have action steps to codify rural character| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1849)|
| 0:30:52| and farmland conservation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| but these plan steps haven't been implemented yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| So we're hoping for some teeth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| We've been told we might get that in the UDO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1859)|
| 0:31:01| but it will be several years until we have a UDO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| So without an updated growth plan or until that UDO takes effect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1864)|
| 0:31:08| we can probably expect the planning commission to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| commissioners to continue recommending plan amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1871)|
| 0:31:14| and rezonings of rural and agricultural land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1874)|
| 0:31:18| especially in this expanded 10,000 acres of planned growth area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1878)|
| 0:31:24| Our group, we've looked at other counties inside and outside of Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| that have enforceable policies in their plans and zoning ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| They've addressed property rights when they did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1891)|
| 0:31:34| We think it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1894)|
| 0:31:36| We'd suggest you might want to hold a general workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1896)|
| 0:31:39| on the general plan around rural protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| So I'll wrap up very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| We're at a junction this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1905)|
| 0:31:47| You could postpone, hold a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1907)|
| 0:31:49| see what planning commission does with the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| or you can approve the growth plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1912)|
| 0:31:54| which has 10,000 new acres of planned growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1914)|
| 0:31:57| and takes a lot of guardrails around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1917)|
| 0:32:00| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1920)|
| 0:32:01| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=1921)|

| 0:34:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2055)|
| 0:34:17| Everyone here knows of the untimely death of Mike McMillan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2057)|
| 0:34:24| and that his passing resulted of several months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| before an election could be held to replace his position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2068)|
| 0:34:37| My understanding is that we have a Republican primary coming up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| and that there are two candidates on the ballot for school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2082)|
| 0:34:46| and district eight in the Republican primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2086)|
| 0:34:50| There are no candidates on the ballot in the Democratic primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2090)|
| 0:34:55| also being held on March 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2095)|
| 0:35:01| I'm going to turn the floor over to Commissioner Beeler| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| to suggest a recommendation on how the commission collectively handles this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2105)|
| 0:35:12| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you for moving this item up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| I guess this would be an appropriate time for me to say a word or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2118)|
| 0:35:22| about Mike McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2122)|
| 0:35:23| I just wanted to say what a remarkable life of public service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2123)|
| 0:35:29| Mike McMillan had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| It really, unparalleled when you think about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| serving the eighth district on county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| as really a legacy county commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| because his father was a county commissioner before that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2139)|
| 0:35:41| and then on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2141)|
| 0:35:43| I don't think there's ever been a school board member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| certainly not in the eighth district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| that had quite the legacy that Mike McMillan had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| in terms of just the physical improvements to the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2153)|
| 0:35:56| in district eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2156)|
| 0:35:58| I know there were two new schools built under his watch on school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2158)|
| 0:36:03| He was a skilled parliamentarian.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2163)|
| 0:36:08| I think his time on county commission served him really well on the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| and I know he was instrumental, to say the least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2173)|
| 0:36:16| in getting Gibbs Middle School approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2176)|
| 0:36:19| which was a huge, huge thing for our community, for my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| But more than all that, he was a great friend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| a great friend to me, to my family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| going all the way back to my grandfather and his father,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| and so he will be greatly, greatly missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2193)|
| 0:36:36| In terms of the vacancy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| I've obviously been contacted by several people in the district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2199)|
| 0:36:42| concerned about the fact that we don't have a representative in that seat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| We all know that Mike did have an illness that he struggled with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| and had to miss a meeting or two later in his tenure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2213)|
| 0:37:01| and so they were concerned as to when we were going to appoint somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| and I had several people reach out that said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| well, we'd be willing to serve until September or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| but as I looked at it, because I believe the first school board meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2231)|
| 0:37:17| after his passing was February 7th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2237)|
| 0:37:20| and there just wasn't time to go through a fair procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2240)|
| 0:37:23| to appoint someone in time for that meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| and there was really no point in trying to appoint someone after that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2247)|
| 0:37:32| when we have an opportunity to appoint the winner of the March 5th primary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| in time for the March school board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2257)|
| 0:37:40| Am I correct, Madam Chair, that there is a school board meeting on the 6th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2260)|
| 0:37:44| Is it the first Wednesday of the month that the school board meets?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| You have me at a disadvantage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2269)|
| 0:37:51| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2271)|
| 0:37:52| I believe that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2272)|
| 0:37:53| Is there anyone who can?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2273)|
| 0:37:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| Okay, thank you, Dr. Roswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2277)|
| 0:37:59| So the election is on the 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| There's a meeting on the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| I would like to request of Madam Chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| that we have a special called meeting on the 6th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| once we know that there is a clear winner of the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| and then we can go ahead and make the appointment in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| for someone in that seat to represent District 8 that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2299)|
| 0:38:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| Is there any discussion about any comments or questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| about what Commissioner Beeler is proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| I will not be in the country at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| I'll be out of the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2314)|
| 0:38:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2315)|
| 0:38:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2316)|
| 0:38:38| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2318)|
| 0:38:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2319)|
| 0:38:40| I concur with Commissioner Beeler's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2320)|
| 0:38:43| I think because of the length of time till the August election| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2323)|
| 0:38:48| that you cannot leave the 8th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| unrepresented on the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| So I'm 100% in favor of your recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2333)|
| 0:38:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2339)|
| 0:39:00| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2340)|
| 0:39:01| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| I would just ask that the Chair be in touch with Chris Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| our Elections Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| Obviously those aren't certified until much later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| but we want to just rely on his report to us about the best final count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2356)|
| 0:39:24| he has that night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| No offense to our news media that may repeat the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| but we want to just make sure he's involved with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| and give him ample enough time as well as with the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| to prepare for a brand new member in a couple of hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2380)|
| 0:39:41| And just in response to that, I did check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2381)|
| 0:39:44| The actual election results are not certified until March 20th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2384)|
| 0:39:50| Perhaps we may have a caveat in all of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2390)|
| 0:39:54| that if there were any dispute over the election,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2394)|
| 0:39:58| it was a matter of a few votes that we might need to preface it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2398)|
| 0:40:04| assuming that does not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2404)|
| 0:40:08| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2410)|
| 0:40:11| This is a primary, and the primary has to go on to the general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| That person will not be elected on March 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2417)|
| 0:40:20| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2420)|
| 0:40:21| They have to vote for themselves in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| If they don't vote for themselves, they're going to lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| So as far as March 6th goes, we can appoint whoever on March 6th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2427)|
| 0:40:33| and we appoint the winner on March 5th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| That's just an appointment is all that is until September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2435)|
| 0:40:39| So there's no question about having to wait until March 20th or whatever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2439)|
| 0:40:44| because they're not elected until August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2444)|
| 0:40:48| Correct, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| And you are correct about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| However, we would be remiss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| I would be thinking to make an appointment that perhaps would be overturned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2456)|
| 0:41:05| as the results of a certification of an election three weeks later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2465)|
| 0:41:10| But you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2470)|
| 0:41:12| It is merely an appointment, and the actual swearing-in will not happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| until September 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| Are there any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| Do we want to go ahead and set a time so that our team can notice it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2483)|
| 0:41:26| and we can go ahead and put it on our calendar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| Do we want to do that here tonight, or do we already have an idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| Actually, I was going to leave that to our commission secretary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2493)|
| 0:41:41| because the first thing she will need to do is check on availability of the room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| But tentatively, we hope to have the exact time and date| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2507)|
| 0:41:54| and location out to you by tomorrow afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| So, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2521)|
| 0:42:02| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2522)|
| 0:42:03| I'll be here in the morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2523)|
| 0:42:04| I fly out at 11, so if you guys can make it for a.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| like 8, 9 o'clock in the morning, then I can make it on the 6th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2527)|
| 0:42:11| But I'll be gone from the 6th into the following week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2531)|
| 0:42:14| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| If you'll take note of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2537)|
| 0:42:20| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2540)|
| 0:42:22| Law Director, is this anything that requires a vote to put this on the special call meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2542)|
| 0:42:30| No, I think you have the authority to call a special meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| All right, thank you then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2553)|
| 0:42:35| Anything else along these lines, Commissioner Wheeler, before we move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2555)|

| 0:49:20| a lot of people can't do and don't want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2960)|
| 0:49:25| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=2965)|

| 0:52:10| It gets approved this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3130)|
| 0:52:12| The good thing is we're coming into spring weather, which will allow for grading and construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| Southern Constructors, I think, is the contractor on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| So they've expressed interest to go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| No, it's Harrison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3143)|
| 0:52:24| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3144)|
| 0:52:25| To get started on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3145)|
| 0:52:27| So I would anticipate a construction start no later than late March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3147)|
| 0:52:32| This does include the connection you were saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| And one of the things else that we've looked at at this project is the at-grade crossings at Woodhaven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| We're going to put activated flashers there so folks can walk up, hit a button,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3160)|
| 0:52:46| and it will turn on and actually hopefully provide a little more advanced warning for traffic going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| So this project does include some active flashers at those locations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3172)|
| 0:52:57| When you say both locations, the one at Twin Creek and one at Woodhaven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3177)|
| 0:53:04| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3187)|
| 0:53:08| Yeah, the one at Twin Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3188)|
| 0:53:10| The Twin Creek subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3190)|
| 0:53:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3191)|
| 0:53:12| The crosswalk there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3192)|
| 0:53:13| The crosswalk there and then the crosswalk at where Woodhaven and I can't think of the name of that other subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| The four-way intersection there, closer to the high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| That's good news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3206)|
| 0:53:27| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| We have a motion on the floor by Daly, second by Ward to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3209)|
| 0:53:39| I apologize, to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3219)|
| 0:53:42| Seeing no lights, all those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3224)|
| 0:53:45| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3225)|
| 0:53:46| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3226)|
| 0:53:49| Item number 32 is resolution 901 to amend the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3229)|
| 0:54:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3240)|
| 0:54:02| I requested that this be pulled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3242)|
| 0:54:10| I did imagine there might be some discussion on this, and I know, Ms. Starbuck, that you had signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3250)|
| 0:54:18| Before we begin, though, do we have a motion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3258)|
| 0:54:30| Motion by Daly, second by Ward to move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3270)|
| 0:54:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3277)|
| 0:54:38| We are in the discussion phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| Ms. Starbuck, if you'd like to come, and I will give you three minutes to speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3280)|
| 0:54:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| I'm not sure your mic is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3292)|
| 0:54:55| There you are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| Thank you for the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3297)|
| 0:55:00| As I have on many occasions, I'm speaking tonight on land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3300)|
| 0:55:05| I realize that land use issues are some of the most difficult and controversial issues that you as commissioners have to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3305)|
| 0:55:13| And it can't be very pleasant for you to have this come up month after month after month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3313)|
| 0:55:19| I was very hopeful that the advanced NOx process and the subsequent comprehensive plan and resulting ordinance would remove a lot of the uncertainty around zoning and land use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3319)|
| 0:55:30| If we could only make plans and ordinances that unequivocally set forth the rules regarding development, everyone would know what can and can't be developed in certain ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3330)|
| 0:55:41| and there would not be a need to have these controversies come up every month that ends up with a lot of upset people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3341)|
| 0:55:48| Think how much more efficiently county commission could function if you didn't have to make these decisions every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3348)|
| 0:55:55| With a land use plan and ordinances that the community can trust won't be changed at the whim of a developer looking to make a buck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3355)|
| 0:56:03| you wouldn't have these controversies all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3363)|
| 0:56:06| I realize that land use does need to change from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3366)|
| 0:56:09| However, there should be strict limits on what changes can be made according to an actual plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3369)|
| 0:56:17| I'm concerned that the growth plan amendment as currently proposed does not accurately reflect the objectives of advanced NOx.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3377)|
| 0:56:25| It does not really make sense that we should make such sweeping changes to the rural area of the growth plan based on rather subjective estimates of population increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3385)|
| 0:56:38| and without any specific information about the comprehensive plan details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3398)|
| 0:56:45| It was clear during the advanced NOx and also the survey that was done by the realtors that conservation and protecting the rural character of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3405)|
| 0:56:58| in addition to providing affordable housing, were the two main concerns established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3418)|
| 0:57:04| The draft comprehensive plan does not seem to reflect either of those priorities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| and I am concerned that once the growth plan has been passed and thousands of rural acres have been targeted for development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3429)|
| 0:57:18| that the companion comprehensive plan will not have the specifics needed to protect this large swath of land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3438)|
| 0:57:26| The comprehensive plan does away with the sector plans and other important plans such as the hillside plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3446)|
| 0:57:33| and while some of this is supposed to be incorporated, it is critical that we use language such as shall and must instead of may and can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3453)|
| 0:57:43| in order to ensure that the comprehensive plan accomplishes what we are trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3463)|
| 0:57:50| It seems to me that we are putting the cart before the horse to open up all of this land before we have even seen the comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3470)|
| 0:58:02| before we know what is going to be passed at planning commission, and before we have had any public input on the specifics of these plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3482)|
| 0:58:12| Thank you for your time and attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| Thank you, Ms. Darba.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3496)|
| 0:58:17| I would recommend that you please consider delaying at least for a month to see what comes out of planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3497)|
| 0:58:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3505)|
| 0:58:27| Are there any other comments or questions about this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3507)|
| 0:58:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3513)|
| 0:58:34| Seeing none, we have a motion on the floor to move forward without.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3514)|
| 0:58:40| Oh, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3520)|
| 0:58:41| Is anybody, there are no additional presentations from anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3521)|
| 0:58:52| Did you have a question that you would like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3532)|
| 0:58:54| I have a question specifically, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3534)|
| 0:58:56| Who could answer a question on appendix D?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3536)|
| 0:59:05| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3545)|
| 0:59:06| It's the text amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3546)|
| 0:59:07| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3547)|
| 0:59:13| You are wanting a question answered on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| The information that's in our packet, one of the captions is text amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| It's about a six-page document and I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| I think it's on page three or four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3564)|
| 0:59:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3566)|
| 0:59:27| So do we have anybody here that could answer that question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3570)|
| 0:59:31| We have two that have come to the podium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3571)|
| 0:59:33| If you would both identify yourselves, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3573)|
| 0:59:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| Jim Snowden, Director of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3577)|
| 0:59:39| We've got a couple of other folks here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| So, yeah, whatever questions we have, we'll get addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| Kathy Olson, Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| Okay, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3587)|
| 0:59:48| On the text amendments documents, there are six pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3588)|
| 0:59:52| They're not numbered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3592)|
| 0:59:53| I'm guessing it's page number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3593)|
| 0:59:55| At the top, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3595)|
| 0:59:57| Rezoning of slopes shall be based on the adopted policies of each legislative body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3597)|
| 1:00:03| Are those the existing legislative, I mean, the adopted policies that go back about, say, ten years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3603)|
| 1:00:12| That is correct, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3612)|
| 1:00:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| And those can be amended or brought back up for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3622)|
| 1:00:28| We're talking about the hillside and slope policy, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| That was about ten years ago, nine years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3631)|
| 1:00:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| And this body at that time chose to make an advisory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3635)|
| 1:00:38| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| And that is something that we can look at as far as the Unified Development Ordinance moving forward as well, if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3639)|
| 1:00:47| But that policy could be brought back up for, instead of advisory, making it mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3647)|
| 1:00:53| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3653)|
| 1:00:54| If this body wishes to do that, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3654)|
| 1:00:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3656)|
| 1:00:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3657)|
| 1:00:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3658)|
| 1:01:04| Director Brooks, did you have anything you wanted to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3664)|
| 1:01:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-240221?start=3667)|
