| 0:00:45| I believe we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=45)|
| 0:00:47| Yes, I had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=47)|
| 0:00:49| And that should be the first one on top of the page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=49)|
| 0:00:51| Yes, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=51)|

| 0:00:55| It's the second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=55)|
| 0:00:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=56)|
| 0:00:57| It's just too disgusting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=57)|
| 0:00:58| The first one is the one I discussed with you about the referral,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=58)|
| 0:01:02| the deferral, automatic deferral on the zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=62)|
| 0:01:05| It was in two different sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=65)|
| 0:01:07| Just to clear that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=67)|
| 0:01:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=68)|
| 0:01:09| Clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=69)|
| 0:01:10| So we've got two additions, one on zonings and one on honorary graduations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=70)|
| 0:01:15| Let's back up a second and do a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=75)|

| 0:01:30| All right, we've got that out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| So we only have two additions, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=91)|
| 0:01:33| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| All righty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=94)|
| 0:01:37| I don't think we need a motion to add these, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=97)|
| 0:01:40| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=100)|

| 0:01:50| I was there, too, on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=110)|
| 0:01:52| Yeah, all of us except Commissioner Frazier there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=112)|
| 0:01:56| So we're going to approve the previous minutes from June and September,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=116)|
| 0:02:01| which was when we elected the chair last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| Motion to approve both June 21st, 2022, and September 21st, 2022 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=124)|

| 0:02:20| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| Carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=141)|
| 0:02:24| All right, discussion and consideration of any late additions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=144)|
| 0:02:29| I'm not sure what that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=149)|
| 0:02:30| You want to just start with the two that added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=150)|
| 0:02:32| That's what we're going to do first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=152)|
| 0:02:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| All right, the first one is Section G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=155)|
| 0:02:39| application for postponements and withdrawals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=159)|
| 0:02:42| Now, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=162)|
| 0:02:43| Drew, is that yours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=163)|
| 0:02:47| What do we need to do on this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| This one on page 78 under agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=169)|
| 0:02:51| it talks about rezoning request to automatically proceed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=171)|
| 0:02:56| And it's, let's see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=176)|
| 0:02:59| it must be received in the commission office before the end of the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| day prior to the agenda work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=181)|
| 0:03:04| And in the zoning section, it says prior to the Wednesday at 4 p.m.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| prior to the zoning session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=190)|
| 0:03:14| So you just want to match them up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=194)|
| 0:03:15| Yeah, they need to be verified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=195)|
| 0:03:18| So, yeah, which one do you prefer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=198)|
| 0:03:21| I think we picked Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=201)|
| 0:03:23| I think we did that on purpose to do Wednesday in advance of the zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| session on Monday so that we gave,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=206)|
| 0:03:29| and it would essentially give us five days notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=209)|
| 0:03:33| So we need the first section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=213)|
| 0:03:36| So I think with that top is what we had worked on adopting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| So the bottom would just need to match the top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=221)|
| 0:03:46| Yeah, I think I remember that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=226)|
| 0:03:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=229)|
| 0:03:51| Yeah, it says an applicant shall be granted one automatic deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=231)|
| 0:03:56| Do you still do the automatic deferral?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=236)|
| 0:03:58| Like should we just take out all the language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=238)|
| 0:04:01| I think we still do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| If they don't show, we defer them to the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=243)|
| 0:04:06| Because the other one has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=246)|
| 0:04:08| it must be made in writing via email and include the maximum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=252)|
| 0:04:15| Yeah, I guess I can just change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=255)|
| 0:04:17| I think you just keep the one above and then add the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| Applicants should be granted one automatic deferral if the request is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| received on time or, you know, for extenuating circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=264)|
| 0:04:28| Like they don't show, you know, if somebody doesn't show,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=268)|
| 0:04:31| we always give them a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=273)|
| 0:04:34| So you want me to change the bottom and the top to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=274)|
| 0:04:39| I don't know if you just, the one on seven and eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| if you just want to keep it more simple and just kind of, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=282)|
| 0:04:45| G is what you did recently in speed score itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=285)|
| 0:04:49| It can always refer to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| I don't know if you just want to like maybe just put it and 10 after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=290)|
| 0:04:57| unless an applicant requested deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=297)|
| 0:05:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=300)|
| 0:05:01| That's what I was thinking too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=301)|
| 0:05:02| And then you would refer to the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=302)|
| 0:05:04| the other link at section G for that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=304)|
| 0:05:07| I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| you can put it when an applicant requests a referral with by that right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| there, I would include it right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=313)|
| 0:05:14| By section by Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| Oh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=318)|
| 0:05:19| by four PM on the Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=319)|
| 0:05:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| And then that would be the end of that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=323)|
| 0:05:26| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=326)|

| 0:06:08| but you're going to keep the rest of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=368)|
| 0:06:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=370)|

| 0:06:40| We're just clarifying the seven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=400)|

| 0:08:01| And so I would like to see an honorary resolution kind of tweet to really include that it's for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=481)|
| 0:08:10| congratulatory or honorary purposes for a significant achievement of an individual or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=490)|
| 0:08:16| organization slash agency, because and by definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=496)|
| 0:08:20| honorary resolutions express collective opinions and they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| require a vote. A proclamation is a public or official| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=503)|
| 0:08:27| announcement, especially when dealing with a matter of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=507)|
| 0:08:29| importance, designed to make a public announcement declare a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| day, week, month issued for holidays, helps to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=512)|
| 0:08:35| information out and make people aware of important matters and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=515)|

| 0:08:42| When then further a discussion item is an item of business on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=522)|
| 0:08:46| an agenda, which is not routine and may be contentious in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=526)|
| 0:08:49| nature, or for which there has been an indication of public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=529)|
| 0:08:52| interest. Again, it expresses individual opinion and does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| require a vote. I think that in the past, we've kind of lumped| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| all of that into honorary resolutions. And I think that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=539)|
| 0:09:04| should clarify those and break them down into honorary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| resolution proclamations and discussion items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=546)|

| 0:09:17| which to me is more to me is more. I will say the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=557)|
| 0:09:21| important, because they're I'm at that event, we're presenting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=561)|

| 0:09:35| state. That's, to me, that's more, more fulfilling to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=575)|
| 0:09:40| person. They stand in front of the limit of us. Yeah. But I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=580)|
| 0:09:45| mean, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| what I think is your clarify is the, like, for instance, if, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=586)|
| 0:09:51| I decided that I would really like to recognize February as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=591)|

| 0:10:06| that as an individual as a proclamation to go down to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=606)|

| 0:10:23| separating that to individual achievements from a person or an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| organization as and that's the only reason out of areas would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=628)|
| 0:10:31| be done. I like it. And that's and that's why you know, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=631)|
| 0:10:35| I did just some quick research on the definitions of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=635)|
| 0:10:40| three and just kind of put this together for children daily to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| look at but and I'm happy to work with you on bringing back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| to Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| I don't know if you need to bring it back. Or this just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| Okay, that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=656)|
| 0:10:58| We can rework paragraph the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| paragraph to to make it where it specifically can only apply to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=661)|
| 0:11:08| specified individuals or organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| There's, I'm kind of, I did not know that y'all had the power or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=672)|
| 0:11:18| in practice in the past have been doing like individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=678)|
| 0:11:20| commission of proclamations. Do you want something in the rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| about that? Because there's nothing in the rules that I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=683)|
| 0:11:26| aware of that even governs those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=686)|
| 0:11:28| numbers. I've not seen anything in here that covers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=692)|
| 0:11:33| Maybe you don't want to be you're doing it when there's no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| rule on it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=696)|
| 0:11:37| It has to go through the law department anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| So we don't actually see any of your proclamations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| I don't know anything about your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| proclamation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| And to your point, Carson, much as you do for proclamation, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=709)|
| 0:11:55| have taken resolutions and taken them to an event and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=715)|
| 0:12:01| still read them and presented them, you know, just like, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| you do for proclamations. So it doesn't really mark that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=726)|
| 0:12:09| option out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=729)|
| 0:12:11| So do we think that we need to have the wording for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=731)|
| 0:12:16| proclamation and resolutions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=736)|
| 0:12:19| Well, I would I would say change section need to say honorary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=739)|
| 0:12:22| resolutions and proclamations and then just have two sections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| under there that outlines this is what an honorary resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=746)|
| 0:12:29| is. And this is what a proclamation is. And then it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=749)|
| 0:12:32| very clear, I would just kind of lump them into the same category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=752)|
| 0:12:35| Honorary resolutions must honor an individual organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=755)|
| 0:12:39| they're voted on by the body, proclamations are individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=759)|
| 0:12:42| declarations of county commissioners, they don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=762)|
| 0:12:44| require consideration or vote by the county, and they can honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| whatever the commissioner wishes to honor. So we can we can work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| that out very easily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| I think that's we're doing and then discussion items, we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=772)|
| 0:12:55| even have discussion items noted in our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=775)|
| 0:12:59| Which I think we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=779)|
| 0:13:01| This is a pretty easy thing to put in there. So I would, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| would be okay, supporting a motion that broke it out like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=786)|
| 0:13:10| this, let you guys do the language and then bring it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=790)|
| 0:13:11| forward without having to see it again. So I feel like we're all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| on the same page, but I want to see the results of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=794)|
| 0:13:17| Um, would we have to adjust the format for the agenda? If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=797)|
| 0:13:23| you're going to do an honorary resolution and then do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=803)|
| 0:13:27| proclamation? No, because the proclamation doesn't require any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| action by the commission. So it would not be a public. This is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| something that you as a commissioner, just get together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| with drew, you have printed on a nice paper, you give it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| whoever you want to, but it doesn't involve you're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=820)|
| 0:13:43| speaking on behalf of the commission. You're speaking on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| behalf of yourself, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| You're saying that I proclaim Bob's Burger Shop, the best| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| burger in Knoxville, right? Because you believe it? I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| think so. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| it really does simplify the process to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| it needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=845)|
| 0:14:06| But he is going to make copies for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| My motion that we clarify Section E honorary resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| to include clarity on the definition of honorary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| resolution, proclamations. And also add a section for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=859)|
| 0:14:26| discussion items with clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=866)|
| 0:14:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=871)|
| 0:14:33| I'm not going to repeat all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=873)|
| 0:14:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=876)|
| 0:14:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| So your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| discussion item, though, would only apply to the resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| No, no, that just be a general discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| Anything you think is important enough that the commission will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| take up and discuss but does not necessarily require a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| So I want to bring it to the commission. Yes, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=897)|
| 0:15:01| Thank you, which is what we've been doing. We just haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=901)|
| 0:15:03| put in a rule. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=903)|
| 0:15:05| which is and by definition, it says if there's an interest, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| public interest or something that you want to bring attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=908)|
| 0:15:11| to, that's where it falls into under discussion. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=915)|
| 0:15:16| Further discussion? All in favor, say aye. Aye. Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=916)|
| 0:15:24| So that's the revisions. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=924)|
| 0:15:27| All right. The first item is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=927)|
| 0:15:30| discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| Does anybody know what page this is on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=934)|
| 0:15:38| Yeah, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| Section| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=943)|
| 0:15:49| That's something you may want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=949)|
| 0:15:51| Just put the page number on our rules for making easy access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=951)|
| 0:15:57| Nine, eight, eight, seven, six, five, eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=957)|
| 0:16:01| And this was rewritten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| We did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=966)|
| 0:16:08| And I'll tell you what I brought up is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| the chair, chairperson, whoever that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| We got this is the public forum on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=977)|
| 0:16:21| That needs to be stated and I got a copy. Drew fills this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=981)|
| 0:16:25| paperwork out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| for people who call in and people come in before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| meeting. So when the chair goes Carson Daly topic is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=991)|
| 0:16:38| red, white and blue agenda item number 12 or whatever they I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| think that we need to have in the rules for us and the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1002)|
| 0:16:46| that the first form is to discuss agenda items only and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1006)|
| 0:16:52| make sure the chairperson needs to say all their name and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1012)|
| 0:16:57| they're speaking on agenda item 38, whatever 38 is or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1017)|
| 0:17:03| I think it needs to be required the applicant to actually stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| and let's say what item they're going to speak on. And they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1025)|
| 0:17:09| could, you know, they could say, we can I'm speaking on item 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1029)|
| 0:17:14| and then two minutes and then 33 minutes or they're on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1034)|
| 0:17:19| else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1039)|
| 0:17:21| No, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| So I'm okay with that. So I guess the form of the motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1043)|
| 0:17:28| would be that the chairs or chairs will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1048)|
| 0:17:34| require the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1054)|
| 0:17:39| does that form have it on? Does it have a column?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| It's got a topic on it, but they don't tell what the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1063)|
| 0:17:46| Well, I think we clarify that as well instead of topic, say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1066)|
| 0:17:49| topic or agenda item that they have to submit the agenda here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1069)|
| 0:17:54| will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1074)|
| 0:17:56| when the person is called the chair will confirm the topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1076)|

| 0:18:03| Yeah, because some people what they do a work session number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1083)|
| 0:18:06| and they call in and then an agenda. I mean, a regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| commission, sometimes those numbers will not match. So that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1090)|
| 0:18:13| would make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1093)|
| 0:18:15| And we just need to know that. I think we as commissioners need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| to know what's the topic they're going to be talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| about, and future commissions also what they're going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| talking about. And sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1104)|
| 0:18:27| they supposed to be talking on a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1107)|
| 0:18:31| current resolution where they go, I'm going, where's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1111)|
| 0:18:35| Yeah, the current agenda, not a past agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1115)|
| 0:18:39| Yeah. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| I have a question. Normally I give the list to chair and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1121)|
| 0:18:46| clerks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1126)|
| 0:18:47| Should I start making copies for everyone for emailing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1127)|
| 0:18:55| No, but we do need to clarify through and I spoke a moment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| ago. I'm glad you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| a rule say that you could come in and sign up, see the vice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| chair. Well, they usually go to jury, we need to add in there to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1144)|
| 0:19:09| see the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1149)|
| 0:19:12| What's your tab?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1152)|
| 0:19:13| Man.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1153)|
| 0:19:15| And or and vice chair, because the vice chair may not, may not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1155)|
| 0:19:20| be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1160)|
| 0:19:20| They don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1160)|
| 0:19:22| Yeah, they're going to do it. You don't say to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1162)|
| 0:19:28| somebody find it right quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| Where do you sign up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| It's about the middle page, the individual group seeking to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1173)|
| 0:19:37| address the commissioner in public forums to register by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| contacting the commission office by telephone or email no later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1179)|
| 0:19:41| than 4pm on the day prior to scheduled meeting or by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| speaking with the commission vice chair in person prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| the start of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1187)|
| 0:19:48| vice chair or commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1188)|
| 0:19:51| manager, commission office manager. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1191)|
| 0:19:55| We just need to add that in there that clears that clears| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1195)|
| 0:19:57| that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1197)|
| 0:20:01| And Drew doesn't do it anyway. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| yes, I'd like to also present for this board's consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1205)|
| 0:20:10| that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| it might, it might help the process of the meeting and also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1211)|
| 0:20:16| help us as commissioners when an item is discussed, if perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1216)|
| 0:20:23| instead of having everyone speak at the beginning, that we waited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1223)|
| 0:20:27| and had them speak before the agenda item was discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1227)|
| 0:20:33| Instead of having everybody do it at the beginning, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| someone's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1238)|
| 0:20:40| y'all are right. Well, we're giving them we're giving them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| the option of waiting to the agenda item or go ahead. You do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| that on zonings. Do you do that on regular?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1247)|
| 0:20:54| It's up to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| And really, it would be better. If it was a group, the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| percent would be better if they waited to that agenda item to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1261)|
| 0:21:04| speak on that agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| You know, I would really kind of like for us to seriously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| consider that it makes the thought process much clearer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1269)|
| 0:21:14| Also, sometimes you have been in a deep discussion on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1274)|
| 0:21:18| else. And then when the agenda item comes up, you I mean, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1278)|
| 0:21:22| can't really hardly remember what the person said or what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1282)|
| 0:21:25| their issue was. I'm just stating that to bunch it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1285)|
| 0:21:29| together might be a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| might be advantageous to everybody to have it all at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1297)|
| 0:21:37| But then when we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| public forum, if we if we make everybody wait to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| resolution comes up, there would be nobody that we wouldn't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1309)|
| 0:21:52| need to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| We have we have a way to have a forum, but it would be at that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1314)|
| 0:21:58| June 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1318)|
| 0:21:59| Right. But that does not take away the fact that we have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| You have that separate section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1324)|
| 0:22:06| That is separate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1326)|
| 0:22:09| We have a public forum where anybody can speak on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1329)|
| 0:22:13| Do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1333)|
| 0:22:16| I would say do you want to just give the speaker an option speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| now or an agenda item 12?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| Or do you want to force it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| I would like to see them wait, but that's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1343)|
| 0:22:30| I'm one person here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| You know, I'm not I'm not going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| What does that look like when it comes to the agenda item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1355)|
| 0:22:38| Well, you could you could just make it a general rule that any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1358)|
| 0:22:43| person who signed up to speak about an agenda item will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1363)|
| 0:22:46| given the opportunity to speak prior to well, you have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| figure out how you want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1369)|
| 0:22:50| Do you want to do a motion and second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| And then it's on the floor and then you call for anybody who's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| there to speak on that item who signed up to speak on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1374)|
| 0:22:57| item. You can handle it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| It's just sort of the order of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| The problem you may run into if you do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| We have we have a situation rise fairly frequently where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| have the regular agenda that goes on after zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1387)|
| 0:23:10| And so if you're there to sign, if you're there to speak, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| know, and suddenly you may have to wait till 10 o'clock or 9| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1393)|
| 0:23:17| o'clock to speak on the item you want to speak on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| That may be a problem for some people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| Of course, that may key in one of our other items that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1401)|
| 0:23:23| coming up here on this agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| But that's an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| That's a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| And I'd like to suggest that if that occurs, which the chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1407)|
| 0:23:36| and the vice chair will know who is signed up to do what, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| if that situation looks like it's going to occur, then let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| it be the responsibility of really probably the vice chair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| to make the statement to the chair, OK, we have this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1428)|
| 0:23:56| agenda, someone has signed up for this after zoning, perhaps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| we should offer them the courtesy of speaking before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| they leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1445)|
| 0:24:06| I mean, I don't think that's going to happen a whole lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1446)|
| 0:24:10| but it could, but it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1450)|
| 0:24:13| The problem that is a lot of times we don't, in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| experience, we don't know until we're right there where we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1456)|
| 0:24:19| going to be in our agenda versus 7 o'clock coming around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1459)|
| 0:24:22| and having to stop with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| And that might be problematic if you get it right up to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| then what do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| Do you go on past 7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| You can't really do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1472)|
| 0:24:33| I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1473)|
| 0:24:34| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1474)|
| 0:24:34| And it just may not be a good idea at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| I just, personally, I just think that's a very, it helps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| the continuity to hear it while we're discussing it, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1481)|
| 0:24:45| I just, I just, for what it's worth, I haven't done this in a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| If people really are motivated enough that they want to speak on an item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1489)|
| 0:24:53| they'll stick around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1493)|
| 0:24:54| That's the way I feel too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| If that's the way they want to do it, they'll find a way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| Yeah, if it's that important to them, then they hang with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1497)|
| 0:25:01| So, so I guess we need some direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| Do you want us to, to require that speakers speak in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1504)|
| 0:25:09| accordance with the item when it comes up on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| Or do you want to make it an option or just leave things the way they are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| I say option because you just don't, you just don't know when.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1515)|
| 0:25:20| It may be nine, 10 o'clock before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1520)|
| 0:25:23| When you get to that section, the chairman could just call each person and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1523)|
| 0:25:26| do you want to speak now or do you want to speak when it comes up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1526)|
| 0:25:28| And just give them that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1528)|
| 0:25:30| Well, and some people may just want to come and say, I support agenda item 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1530)|
| 0:25:38| And basically within 30 seconds to a minute, then they sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1538)|
| 0:25:42| There's no reason to hold them up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| If they want to come to the front part of the agenda and then that way, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| we don't have many of those, but just some people just say, hey, I'm in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| because, uh, you know, this, this, this, and then just, then they leave, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| a lot of times, as soon as the, as soon as they discuss the item, they, they're.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1558)|
| 0:26:03| Well, I think if you, if you give everybody the option where we are on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| agenda, then, then that takes care of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1567)|
| 0:26:09| If I were just wanting to express that, they may just prefer to do it right then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| That will be the chair to ask that question to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1573)|
| 0:26:16| So we could just insert a quite, you know, aligned with this rule that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| that, that each person shall be given the option of speaking at the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1579)|
| 0:26:23| forum for when the item comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1583)|
| 0:26:27| So make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1588)|
| 0:26:28| Oh, may I just add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1588)|
| 0:26:29| So the third sentence kind of says that already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1593)|
| 0:26:33| I, I know this is a long paragraph.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1593)|
| 0:26:35| I'll just say the commission provides the public the opportunity at the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| work session and commission meetings to address an agenda item during the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1598)|
| 0:26:42| commission's discussion or consideration of the item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1602)|
| 0:26:44| But then it goes on to say, you have additional opportunities at five o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| But we really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| But we really don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1612)|
| 0:26:52| We, we, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Maybe it's not stated every meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| I think it's, it's, it's been done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1616)|
| 0:26:58| It's just not stated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1618)|
| 0:26:59| Wouldn't you say, like, you have the opportunity to, you want to speak at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1619)|
| 0:27:03| agenda item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1623)|
| 0:27:03| I mean, I know that I've heard this before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| Does it happen every meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| I wouldn't mind adding the one length on the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| It's very quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| And then I would, I would add to the motion to put a couple of breaks in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1631)|
| 0:27:14| I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| Back to sign up to speak on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| You've got, um, on the day prior to schedule me or by speaking with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1642)|
| 0:27:26| commission vice chair or commission manager prior to start of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1646)|
| 0:27:31| Sometimes we have people that will sign up on the commission for the day of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| meeting, or they will call into the office the day of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1654)|
| 0:27:37| And I usually just put the name on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| Are you guys okay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1663)|
| 0:27:43| I mean, at least, you know, and I've, I've spoken to two, a couple of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1663)|
| 0:27:49| former chairs that once public forum is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1669)|
| 0:27:55| the chair, we got rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1675)|
| 0:27:56| We follow the chair goes public forums over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| Don't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1680)|
| 0:28:00| Is there anyone else in the audience that would like to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1680)|
| 0:28:03| No, no, you don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| They did not sign up and they did not follow the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| So of course that didn't go so well for me when I was beginning my chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| we were at one 30 in the morning and we'd all agreed to stop at a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| time and then everyone, see, here's the problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1699)|
| 0:28:21| Let the mob take over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| Problem with that person is you've got a line here about eight lines up from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| the bottom of the chair or a commissioner may also recognize individuals who have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| not arranged to speak before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| If they determine that such as the public interest, that's different than,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| yeah, that is totally different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1716)|
| 0:28:38| If I see someone come in late and I know they want to talk on that subject, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| I would speak up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| And I think the rules give you a backstop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| I remember there was one time where the rules said you have to sign up by ax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| more people signed up afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1731)|
| 0:28:53| And because we had so many, we basically said, sorry, if you signed up before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1733)|
| 0:28:57| the deadline, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1737)|
| 0:28:58| If you jumped in at the end of the line, we, we got, we can't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1738)|
| 0:29:01| 27 more people and we had to cut it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1741)|
| 0:29:04| So I think the chair has a lot of latitude there to be able to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1744)|
| 0:29:06| So I understand what you're saying, but I think, I think that we still, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1746)|
| 0:29:11| chair, that language entered for the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1751)|
| 0:29:14| So what was your motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1754)|
| 0:29:17| My motion was to do what he said, to add a line, which I can't remember now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| I said, we can add a line that says that a person who's signed up to speak on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1762)|
| 0:29:26| the line will be given the option to speak either in public forum or during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1766)|
| 0:29:31| discussion of the item and then to tag on, adding the meet with the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1771)|
| 0:29:34| manager today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| And so those were the two things wrapped into one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1775)|
| 0:29:40| That motion by commissioner J seconded by commissioner maker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1786)|

| 0:29:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1792)|

| 0:30:01| I think this is all we should have done so much more than gave me a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1806)|

| 0:31:03| Then next, next line of order is do we want to do zoning or new applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1863)|
| 0:31:11| or do we want to do the fines first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1871)|

| 0:31:20| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1880)|

| 0:31:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| We can go that order of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| I will, we won't do this today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| I just wanted to bring it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1887)|
| 0:31:30| Would it be something that maybe it was more appropriate for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| beer board to do to write its own rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| I mean, the chair of the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Well, no, I mean, the beer board has the authority to adopt its own rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1897)|
| 0:31:44| Oh, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| You don't need to say, yeah, forget that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| We can write it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1910)|
| 0:31:51| I mean, we can suggest that a rule is sent it to the beer board for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1911)|
| 0:31:55| this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1915)|
| 0:31:55| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1915)|
| 0:31:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| Moment of danger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1917)|
| 0:31:58| There used to be a sub smaller group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1918)|
| 0:32:02| And, and, and all of that, not only the order, order of business and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1922)|
| 0:32:07| everything is the fines, what the level of the three fines are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1927)|
| 0:32:12| So we had all in the rules and we can always go back and change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| I just think it needs to be done for future, for future commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1936)|
| 0:32:21| We have, we can drive up an order of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| So that's where it's worth it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1945)|
| 0:32:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1945)|
| 0:32:25| That's what, that's not a motion for anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| It's just something I'll ask Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| Moyers to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1950)|
| 0:32:32| Um, what am I missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| What am I missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1953)|
| 0:32:34| Um, because it, it seems to me that's the order that's stated in the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1954)|
| 0:32:39| but we don't have it in our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| No, it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| Oh, in the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1962)|
| 0:32:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1962)|
| 0:32:42| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| And we also don't, we don't bring in all of the, somewhere in our world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| I was given like the, it was a bit of the state law of here's, here's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1967)|
| 0:32:54| maximum you can do and here's the suggestion is a bit of that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1974)|
| 0:32:59| I had to pull that out separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1981)|
| 0:33:01| It's just, it's because we're always, it's to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1981)|
| 0:33:04| It's really to help us now and in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| So thank you, uh, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| Moyers, the item eight discussion, consideration and zonings regarding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1988)|
| 0:33:14| knowledge of opposition to going out, picking on my friend here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1994)|
| 0:33:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=1999)|
| 0:33:22| Last month, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| there was a motion made to, uh, postpone this month and we all agreed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2007)|
| 0:33:35| And then there was a, this started discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2015)|
| 0:33:38| My friend to the left said, well, we have opposition out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2018)|
| 0:33:42| We would like to hear from this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| We've done that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| And it went smooth last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| It didn't go smooth at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| They started getting argued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2028)|
| 0:33:51| You know, they started pressing at each other across the fair and we don't need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2031)|
| 0:33:54| that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2034)|
| 0:33:56| Robert's room over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2036)|
| 0:33:57| Pray me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2037)|
| 0:33:58| Motion on the floor was to move to January, January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2038)|
| 0:34:02| That's all we discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2042)|
| 0:34:03| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2043)|
| 0:34:03| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2043)|
| 0:34:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2044)|
| 0:34:05| Nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| Or any, or any member that could notice a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| The discussion was out and the chair then rules on that, on that note of, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2051)|
| 0:34:18| I actually did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2059)|
| 0:34:19| And that's, that's the way, that's the way that should be handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| If, if, if a discussion comes up that is not consistent with the motion that's on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| the floor, in this case, it was to, to, uh, to defer the only, the only discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2068)|
| 0:34:35| that would have been an order is whether or not it's a good idea to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| But once we had the opposition coming, then we're talking about the merits of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2078)|
| 0:34:41| the, of the, and that shouldn't come up unless there's a motion to approve or to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| deny on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| That's the only point where that becomes a relevant discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2089)|
| 0:34:51| And I, you know, let me say this, then you can tear me up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| No, no, no, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| Once that motion was made and everything, when we gave that opposition an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2097)|
| 0:35:02| opportunity to discuss, we started into the discussion of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2102)|
| 0:35:07| It's what we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| Sometimes during a zoning item, we've started a discussion, had a motion and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2111)|
| 0:35:16| second and started the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2116)|
| 0:35:19| And then we get halfway into it and then we realized, okay, we're going to ask for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2119)|
| 0:35:23| a 30 day postponement, but we've allowed the folks that have come downtown to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| attend that meeting to get their, their viewpoints across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| We have things in the agenda that says the zoning, the zoning issue has to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2132)|
| 0:35:37| postponed or withdraw prior to the meeting, the Wednesday before, Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2137)|
| 0:35:42| before, but we're not letting that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2142)|
| 0:35:46| And so when the public hasn't had an opportunity to realize, Hey, wait a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2146)|
| 0:35:49| minute, they're going to be, this is going to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| I got babysitters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2153)|
| 0:35:54| We ran down here for this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2154)|
| 0:35:56| That's why I felt like those folks should have had an opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| So maybe what we need to do is start the discussion on that item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2161)|
| 0:36:07| And then move to a, a postponement for 30 days because the developer, we just need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2167)|
| 0:36:15| to hold their feet to the fire that says, if you're going to postpone an item, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| have to know by that Wednesday timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| An applicant cannot request a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2181)|
| 0:36:24| It has to come from a member of the body at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| I was sick and I knew we were, we supposed to suspended the rules and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2189)|
| 0:36:34| voted to move it to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2194)|
| 0:36:36| I do believe because our rules say it's got to be done before the Wednesday, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2196)|
| 0:36:42| I think that's so, but it doesn't make a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| Well, again, the rules say that, that if the applicant wants to postpone it, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| have to, they have to ask us that in such a time for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2213)|
| 0:36:57| I don't think the commission is tying its own hands, but in that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2217)|
| 0:37:05| case, I think, at least as I understood it, everybody in the room knew that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| motion that was going to be on the floor was deferred, whether that's because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2230)|
| 0:37:15| applicant had told everybody, I don't know, cause it was Christmas, but I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| everybody wanted it deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2239)|
| 0:37:21| And so to have gotten into the discussion of the merits of the item when we knew,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2241)|
| 0:37:27| well, I think the first motion that was on the floor was to defer, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| At that point, the only discussion that would have been, you know, in order would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| have been just to whether or not we defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2256)|
| 0:37:39| Now to do what, what you wanted to do would be okay, but that's where you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| need to suspend the rules or move to allow the discussion anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2263)|
| 0:37:48| But I think it would take a vote because under ordinary procedure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| that would not be in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2271)|
| 0:37:53| So I think it should be an option to do that, to move, to make a motion to hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2273)|
| 0:37:58| To suspend the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| And I don't like, I mean, any verbiage that's in this, I saw there was some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| inconsistency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2283)|
| 0:38:04| Sometimes it's called public input and sometimes it's called opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2284)|
| 0:38:08| And we probably need to do a full review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| We changed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| I think in the zoning, you used to call it opposition and then we actually changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| the language to say, is there community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| So the chair is supposed to say, is there any community input?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2296)|
| 0:38:23| But she doesn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2303)|
| 0:38:27| Well, that's not, that's not quite clear either because there can be community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| input that can be for or canceled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2311)|
| 0:38:35| The goal was to say that it's not always an opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2315)|
| 0:38:38| Sometimes neighborhoods stand up and go, Hey, look, we were all for this and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2318)|
| 0:38:43| love this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2323)|
| 0:38:43| And that's still relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| Um, it was basically the applicant and anyone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| Does anybody else want to lie in it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2329)|
| 0:38:50| But we always phrase it as opposition before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2330)|
| 0:38:53| And so it was already adversarial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| So we changed that language hoping that all future chairs would say, is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2335)|
| 0:38:59| anybody else that wants to put input on this versus just so people don't like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| Hopefully I understand what commissioners can make her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| If the chair there realizes that there's going to be a postponement or defer for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2347)|
| 0:39:12| 30 or 60 days before that motion is made, they, if there's opposition, cause| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| y'all was always asked for opposition is opposite any opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| And if we know that it's going to be deferred, we can let them come up and say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| their piece and keep it in order to where they won't be arguing back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2365)|
| 0:39:30| forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2370)|
| 0:39:30| Well, of course, that's what commissioner Schoenmaker did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2374)|
| 0:39:35| And the problem was then the applicant chimed in and said, well, here's what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2375)|
| 0:39:38| wrong with all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2378)|
| 0:39:40| It was after the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2380)|
| 0:39:42| I think we should be able to make a motion to hear public input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2382)|
| 0:39:46| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| And you can't say it's an opposition cause that's just what Larson was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| Well, you can't just say, okay, you're against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| Let me hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2395)|
| 0:39:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2396)|
| 0:39:56| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2396)|
| 0:39:57| Other than the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| I don't know if there's, if we need to add something to this or not, it's just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| something that we need to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2403)|
| 0:40:05| I think it's already under Robert's rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| It's already, just need to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| It's just a matter of following them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| And that was just a difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| Hey, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2414)|
| 0:40:14| Every month is a learning experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2414)|
| 0:40:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2420)|
| 0:40:20| And then as soon as you got your grasp of it, your turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| Number nine, uh, discussion on section eight legislative session and zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2425)|
| 0:40:33| session meeting times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2433)|
| 0:40:34| That's actually my friends here, but I'll support him on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2434)|
| 0:40:39| So I'm like recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2439)|
| 0:40:41| You're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2441)|
| 0:40:42| Well, uh, follow along with me for just a couple of minutes here on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2442)|
| 0:40:46| Uh, when I first, uh, came on commission eight years ago, uh, I was approached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2446)|
| 0:40:51| by the two at large commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| Um, because our meeting time was at 2 PM for commission meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2453)|
| 0:40:59| and then 7 PM for zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| So that was the established time they had come to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| And I guess I was the deciding vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| I don't know, but had convinced me that the public needed to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2466)|
| 0:41:11| attend our meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| And so the effort was to change the meeting time to what we currently have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| now, five o'clock for commission meeting and seven o'clock for zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2477)|
| 0:41:22| Um, with the caveat that if it didn't work, we'd go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2482)|
| 0:41:28| Well, I think we've pretty much realized the public's not coming down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| for our general commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| So what my proposal would be and follow with me just till I get to the end is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| that commission would start at three o'clock PM the then at 5 PM, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2501)|
| 0:41:47| have honorary resolution, honorary resolutions and presentations, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| then zoning would start at 6 PM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| Now to combine nine and 10 together, what I would suggest is that we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2516)|
| 0:42:03| have beer board me on the work session time at 2 PM, since those are business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2523)|
| 0:42:08| owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| And then the work session would follow suit at 3 PM, just like we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2530)|
| 0:42:15| the commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2535)|
| 0:42:17| And what, what this would basically do would, uh, allow if, and there's no way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2537)|
| 0:42:24| to put a, uh, a cost savings to this, but what we would be basically doing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2544)|
| 0:42:29| freeing up our County employees who are coming down to a meeting, having to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2549)|
| 0:42:34| through all the honorary resolutions, all the presentations and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2554)|
| 0:42:39| And because they're going into basically overtime, we're now compensating them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2559)|
| 0:42:43| with comp time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2563)|
| 0:42:44| So our, our, our cost of meetings for our County officials, not only the County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2564)|
| 0:42:51| ones, but also the Knox County schools, they're having to have their people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2571)|
| 0:42:55| there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| So what my proposal is, is to do our general business membership meeting at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| 3 PM, break at five o'clock, do your presentations and honorary resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2581)|
| 0:43:07| Uh, if those get done quickly and you still need more time than before 6 PM,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2587)|
| 0:43:12| you, uh, you complete your County business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| And then at 6 PM, we break and go to, um, zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2595)|
| 0:43:19| And on that day, you'd also do beer boards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2599)|
| 0:43:21| You do a beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2601)|
| 0:43:21| No, no, no beer board beyond work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| Cause there's no today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2604)|
| 0:43:25| Yeah, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2607)|
| 0:43:27| There's no, the state doesn't say you have to have beer board on ice, but you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| know, that's up to us when we have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2611)|
| 0:43:32| And since the public's never really coming down for beer board to have it at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2612)|
| 0:43:37| two o'clock, it's just business owners or violators who are business owners that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2617)|
| 0:43:43| you know, so that's what my proposal is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2623)|
| 0:43:48| When did it change from two to five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| It was probably, I want to say it was either beginning of 2016 because it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2630)|
| 0:43:57| before I'm the only guy that was there at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2637)|
| 0:44:00| I don't think you were there at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2640)|
| 0:44:01| Cause I remember it was Dave, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| In 2015, cause it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| Cause you were in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2647)|
| 0:44:08| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2649)|
| 0:44:09| So it was, it was, uh, 2016 is Dave Ryan and, um, uh, Bob Thomas, Dave Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| And so the crux is the major concern is the amount of staff time for, for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2656)|
| 0:44:23| employees in Knox County, whether it be mayor's office or school or department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| heads that are in PBA, but that's the genesis for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2667)|
| 0:44:33| I mean, and we've got, we do other gut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2673)|

| 0:44:46| So we've had the precedents already been set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2686)|
| 0:44:48| We're just now basically going back to what we've been doing, but just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2688)|

| 0:44:57| I'm just like, there's a lot of citizen concern about those meetings at one 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2697)|
| 0:45:03| but it prevents them from, from we hear that a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2703)|
| 0:45:09| Citizens don't understand why, especially planning commission meetings are at one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| 30, they would like to see them moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2713)|
| 0:45:16| I mean, I've heard that for a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2716)|
| 0:45:20| So I think that you've got a way out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2720)|
| 0:45:24| If the constituent, the weight of constituents being able to come to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2724)|

| 0:45:36| They can still come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| If the change was from three to five, they still could come at five o'clock| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| and do public forum and make their statements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| But if we had something, I guess the concern is if we had something on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2745)|

| 0:46:14| Just like the agenda, I'm saying move resolutions and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2774)|
| 0:46:17| presentations to five o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2777)|
| 0:46:20| I'm not saying the general, if you have an agenda item, you come at three o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| No, but the general public, if you had an agenda item that they didn't agree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2785)|
| 0:46:29| you will have taken action before they show up to say, hey, don't take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| And that, and that, why don't we put it all in the front?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2794)|
| 0:46:36| Well, for example, tonight, unless this makes change, the two agenda items has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| nothing to do with government business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2801)|
| 0:46:44| It's on the topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2804)|
| 0:46:45| It's one of the resolution, but it's nothing really to do with government business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| We have engineering and the mayor's office, they're all sitting out there and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2809)|

| 0:47:00| And we've seen, uh, because of the work of community television, that more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2820)|
| 0:47:06| now are watching us at home and, and, or online, and even the news media is doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2826)|

| 0:48:15| consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2895)|

| 0:48:41| It's just, you know, is it something that we want to bring forward to all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2921)|

| 0:49:28| I've told the TV people, I said, listen, work session is more important because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2968)|
| 0:49:32| that's where the discussion happens and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2972)|

| 0:49:45| I haven't let all the commissioners weigh in on it, but I feel like we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| get a lot of good, different opinions than for us four to decide something and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=2988)|

| 0:50:31| Um, on one hand, you know, if you're, if you're a senior, um, administrator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3031)|

| 0:50:46| I mean, is this, I do hear this about some of our commissioners that, uh, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3046)|
| 0:50:54| concerned that it would eliminate people from actually running maybe because they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3054)|
| 0:51:00| just could not come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| I mean, and, or, or maybe not, maybe, maybe what we are, where we are shouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3063)|
| 0:51:08| even be a consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3068)|

| 0:51:12| So, uh, I'm just, I'm just kind of voicing some thoughts right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| Also, are the, uh, the, the county staff that you're referring to, are they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3077)|

| 0:51:50| I mean, as if somebody doesn't, you know, a very, very full, full time job, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3110)|
| 0:51:54| would make it harder for, to go to a different schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| It's hard enough as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| I wonder if it would discourage people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3121)|
| 0:52:03| I'm going to take opportunity to ask commissioner Oster what she thinks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| since she's sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| So that's one more at six opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| If she wants to, let's go to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| Um, I get, I'm like Terry, I get both sides, but I, I'm a little concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3136)|
| 0:52:22| about changing the times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| Um, I mean, I can do my schedule around being a realtor, but, and, but this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| has kind of become my full-time job, but we also have commitments that we get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| invited to things during the day that happened at one or two o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3153)|
| 0:52:39| And I would hate to tell an organization that I couldn't be there on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| day, you know, because sometimes you're going from one straight to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| And then I think, I don't know if it's not going to set up a look like you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| not wanting the community involved, even though a ton are coming down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3171)|
| 0:52:55| And I agree with John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3175)|
| 0:52:57| They have the opportunity to come down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3177)|
| 0:53:00| It's, you know what I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3180)|
| 0:53:01| And so I think it kind of changes that dynamic a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3181)|
| 0:53:04| And you also don't want to upset the apple cart with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3184)|
| 0:53:07| So I see both sides of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3187)|
| 0:53:09| I think it should be taken to, I mean, here we are at one 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3189)|
| 0:53:14| We have another one at three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3196)|
| 0:53:17| So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3197)|
| 0:53:17| set it up as a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3197)|
| 0:53:19| I mean, all 11, definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3201)|
| 0:53:22| Get, get everybody's input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| Now I love the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3203)|
| 0:53:24| I can just interject this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3204)|
| 0:53:26| I love the idea of putting beer, beer board on work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3206)|
| 0:53:30| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3210)|
| 0:53:30| I mean, it makes, it makes next week so long if you have a big zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3210)|
| 0:53:36| So it doesn't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| Beer boards usually pretty quick anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| So I think that really should be on the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| I would agree with that because we also have pension retirement that we are always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| rushing out of, which is a really important committee to get down to do some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| beer board applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3229)|
| 0:53:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3230)|
| 0:53:52| I would, I would move that regardless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3232)|
| 0:53:54| Yeah, no, I would just, I would say that would be a no brainer for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3238)|
| 0:53:58| Before you speak, John, if I may, one, just one other comment on the employees that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3238)|
| 0:54:04| accumulate the comp time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3244)|
| 0:54:06| And I, I just, if I just like to ask you all, are, is it possible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3246)|
| 0:54:12| Can you begin an option on days that you have these commission meetings that, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3252)|
| 0:54:17| know, you, you don't come to work at eight, you kind of want, or, I mean, there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3257)|
| 0:54:24| there ought to be some ways to kind of, you know, soften that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3264)|
| 0:54:29| Or you can't, we can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3269)|
| 0:54:32| Drew can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3272)|
| 0:54:34| Well, but Sharon could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3274)|
| 0:54:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3277)|
| 0:54:37| Well, Sharon doesn't normally attend the meetings unless I need her to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3277)|
| 0:54:42| Um, I usually have her, sometimes she comes for training, um, for her, she would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3282)|
| 0:54:48| draw time and a half comp time for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3288)|
| 0:54:51| I get one for one swap and I try to use mine within the same pay period that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3291)|
| 0:54:57| have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3297)|
| 0:54:58| Sometimes I will ask the chair, is it okay if I extend my comp time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3298)|
| 0:55:02| So say the next week, I want to combine it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3302)|
| 0:55:04| Like I want to take the day off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3304)|
| 0:55:06| Sometimes I'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| Um, but mine's one for one swap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3307)|
| 0:55:09| But if I wanted to come in late in the next day, I mean, usually after commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3309)|
| 0:55:14| meeting day, it's kind of slower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3314)|
| 0:55:17| I could probably come in later if I wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3317)|
| 0:55:19| Well, that's just a, a, a suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3319)|
| 0:55:21| What, what, how would legal be on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3321)|
| 0:55:24| I guess we have to ask David, but I think he's pretty flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3324)|
| 0:55:27| Anyway, if that's truly a major concern, I'm just stating that that could be a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3327)|
| 0:55:34| for the departments to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3334)|
| 0:55:36| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| Uh, well, could I make a motion that we recommend to the full commission that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| move beer board to the work session at, at this point in time, then at four o'clock?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3350)|
| 0:55:51| I'll second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| Do we have to, we're okay adding that without, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| So we do have the motion from Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| Schoenmacher, the seconded by Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| J that we're going to do beer board on work session, which makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3364)|
| 0:56:11| If it's part of that motion, can we stipulate which month that would start?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| We start that in March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| I mean, I could put it in the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3379)|
| 0:56:20| I won't put it in the rules, but is that, yeah, the resolution starting in March,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3380)|
| 0:56:25| because ours is a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3386)|
| 0:56:27| Just because the calendar for March is different meeting days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3387)|
| 0:56:29| Cause of the spring break.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3389)|
| 0:56:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| Also, it'll help us on the, uh, like today we've got the public on the, uh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3393)|
| 0:56:40| we're not the public forum for the ordinance public meeting, public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3400)|
| 0:56:47| It could be at four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| You know, we may need to just think it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3408)|
| 0:56:52| We may need to push that out another month because I'm thinking, aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3412)|
| 0:56:56| there, um, meetings that are already scheduled where we go on work session at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3416)|
| 0:57:02| three o'clock this last time before us in February be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3422)|
| 0:57:08| So the earliest it would happen would be March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| You have to earn it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3430)|
| 0:57:11| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3431)|
| 0:57:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3432)|
| 0:57:12| We find that session is, yeah, we can get everything's front loaded on this day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3432)|
| 0:57:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3438)|
| 0:57:18| Well, committee meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3438)|
| 0:57:20| I'm talking about those types of things sometimes, but, but maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| I mean, I'd have to sit down and relook at my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3447)|
| 0:57:29| Let's say you got a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3449)|
| 0:57:32| All in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3452)|
| 0:57:35| March.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3455)|
| 0:57:36| It'd be starting in March or April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3458)|
| 0:57:38| I think in February we have a finance committee prior to the work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3458)|
| 0:57:42| beginning in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| Um, but as far as I know, there's nothing else scheduled prior to finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| So finance would have to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3468)|
| 0:57:50| We get to slide that down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3470)|
| 0:57:51| It's once four times a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3471)|
| 0:57:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3473)|
| 0:57:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3474)|
| 0:57:57| All in favor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3477)|
| 0:57:58| Say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3478)|
| 0:57:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3479)|
| 0:57:59| All opposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| Nose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3480)|
| 0:58:00| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-rules-committee-230117?start=3480)|
