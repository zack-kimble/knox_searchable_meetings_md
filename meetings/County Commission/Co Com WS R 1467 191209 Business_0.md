| 0:00:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=37)|
| 0:00:38| Commissioner Beeler did share with, I'm here, yes, and Commissioner Beeler did share with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=38)|
| 0:00:40| me prior to the meeting that he was going to be out of town for a wedding, so his absence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=40)|
| 0:00:44| is expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=44)|
| 0:00:46| So, Commissioner Boesler, would you please lead us in the Pledge of Allegiance for our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=46)|

| 0:01:04| which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=64)|
| 0:01:13| Okay, thank you, Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=73)|
| 0:01:18| As of right now, or immediately prior to the meeting, we have not had anyone approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=78)|
| 0:01:23| the Commission Office about speaking at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=83)|
| 0:01:26| I would like to open that up right now in case there's anyone in the audience who would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=86)|
| 0:01:32| like an opportunity to address the County Commission as part of our public forum agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=92)|
| 0:01:38| Okay, seeing none, the next thing we're getting ready to move into is where we set our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=98)|
| 0:01:46| For those of you who may be watching at home, or if this is your first time you've ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=106)|
| 0:01:50| attended one of the meetings, the County Commission has two formal meetings each month, usually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=110)|
| 0:01:57| on the third and fourth Monday of each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=117)|
| 0:02:00| The purpose of tonight's meeting is to serve as a work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| So to use a metaphor like Congress, this is sort of the committee meeting where we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=124)|
| 0:02:08| going to take our first pass through the agenda, we're going to discuss a lot of the items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| that are before us for this month, and then by the end of the meeting, we are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=132)|
| 0:02:17| have whittled our agenda down to a smaller list where some of the items are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| be placed on something called a consent agenda so that we can vote and be more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=142)|
| 0:02:26| at next month's meeting where most of those items will all be voted together in one time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| So I think of tonight as literally just a committee work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=152)|
| 0:02:38| As I move on, I do want to take a moment to recognize some of our other elected officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=158)|
| 0:02:42| I see in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=162)|
| 0:02:44| First of all, I see Mayor Glenn Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=164)|
| 0:02:46| Mayor Jacobs, thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=166)|
| 0:02:48| I was just talking to Sheriff Tom Spangler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=168)|
| 0:02:51| Tom, thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=171)|
| 0:02:53| And I see in the very back, I see Super Bob Thomas, our school superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=173)|
| 0:02:58| I didn't call on you, Charlie, yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=178)|
| 0:03:00| So I also want to now call on Charlie Susano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=180)|
| 0:03:06| And as is the norm at County Commission, I always bring up Sister Paulinas from our days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=186)|
| 0:03:11| at Sacred Heart School, who was a strict disciplinarian with Mr. Susano.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=191)|
| 0:03:17| So are there any other elected officials that I may have inadvertently missed by accident?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=197)|
| 0:03:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=203)|
| 0:03:24| On purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=204)|
| 0:03:25| Or on purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=205)|
| 0:03:26| Then seeing none, we'll move on to setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=210)|
| 0:03:32| Based on some of the items that I had pulled and based on your feedback on the forum or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=212)|
| 0:03:36| having reached out to me prior to the meeting, tonight I'm going to add, as I mentioned on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=216)|
| 0:03:41| the forum, one discussion item, which is going to be reviewing some of our priorities to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=221)|
| 0:03:47| go over with the Knox County delegation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=227)|
| 0:03:50| We have a lunch that's been previously announced that's scheduled to be at Calhoun's on Bearden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=230)|
| 0:03:54| Hill on Friday, the 17th of January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=234)|
| 0:03:59| It'll be a similar format to what we've done in the past with, and I'll save the details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=239)|
| 0:04:05| for the discussion item, but the luncheon is Friday, the 17th of January, and as one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| of our discussion items, we want to kind of formulate some of the things that we'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=250)|
| 0:04:13| to share with them to focus on, on behalf of Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=253)|
| 0:04:18| That's going to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=258)|
| 0:04:19| The non-consent items will be items 6, 8, 36, 40, 41, 42, and there's a few others I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=259)|
| 0:04:33| add back because I've got them in different order here, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=273)|

| 0:07:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| I would say the proper motion on this will probably be to send forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=421)|
| 0:07:07| But as everybody drew, has everybody got their names submitted yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=427)|
| 0:07:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=432)|
| 0:07:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=433)|

| 0:07:17| The additional step that needs to take place before we vote on this next week is that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=437)|
| 0:07:21| Election Commission does check on them to make sure that whoever you're proposing for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=441)|

| 0:07:29| So those of you who have not had a chance to get them in, please do your best to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| it to ideally by, I think if we got them, if the Election Commission got it by Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=452)|
| 0:07:38| or Friday at the latest, they've been turning around pretty quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=458)|
| 0:07:40| Ms. Drusilla, isn't that clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| Usually the same day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=464)|
| 0:07:45| So if y'all could try to get them in by Friday, that would be very helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=465)|
| 0:07:49| So all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=469)|
| 0:07:51| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=471)|
| 0:07:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=472)|
| 0:07:53| Mr. Daly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=473)|

| 0:07:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=479)|

| 0:08:32| Just somebody from the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| Ron, maybe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| Mr. MacPherson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=514)|

| 0:08:37| Buehler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| Hello, Dr. Roswick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=519)|
| 0:08:42| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=522)|
| 0:08:45| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| Just, I just had a fiscal question on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=526)|
| 0:08:52| It said $37 per student, but it didn't, I didn't see any details where it showed how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| many students or what the total cost would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=535)|
| 0:08:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=539)|
| 0:09:00| For estimate, I know you probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=540)|
| 0:09:01| So the way this is done, and Ron may have to get a total on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=541)|
| 0:09:04| I'm not sure that I have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| So it's all the, all of our junior class takes that test in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=546)|
| 0:09:12| And so that's passed on to us through BEP dollars that we get for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| So I'd have to look to see what that total amount is, but it covers that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| And any seniors who don't test at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=560)|
| 0:09:22| So it's cost neutral for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| There's no cost for us for that because it's on BEP dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| But I'm sorry, I don't have the number in front of me exactly how many juniors that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=570)|
| 0:09:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=571)|
| 0:09:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=572)|
| 0:09:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=573)|
| 0:09:34| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=574)|
| 0:09:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=575)|
| 0:09:36| So do, do our students have an opportunity to take the SAT?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=576)|
| 0:09:43| They do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=583)|
| 0:09:44| The state pays for the ACT for them to take that, but the SAT can be used the same way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=584)|
| 0:09:50| the state law requires or graduation requirements from the state are either SAT or ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=590)|
| 0:09:56| What's given in school in Knox County is the ACT, SAT kind of came along later saying it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=596)|
| 0:10:04| equal for them to be able to do that too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=604)|
| 0:10:06| And it could be a school by school decision how they choose to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=606)|
| 0:10:09| But ours and the majority of the state have chosen to stick with the ACT for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| I just wonder because some of the measures under the SAT are better measures than the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=613)|
| 0:10:18| ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=618)|
| 0:10:19| And if we look to changing that at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| We had one school a few years ago, Bearden High School that looked at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| And so the one thing the SAT does, it's tied in with the college board for AP potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=628)|
| 0:10:33| for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=633)|
| 0:10:34| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=634)|
| 0:10:36| So it's a pre-SAT for our younger students, our freshmen and sophomores to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=636)|
| 0:10:39| determine that at an earlier level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=639)|
| 0:10:40| So our kids are pretty well covered for that, but really outside of that, I would say they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=640)|
| 0:10:45| pretty equal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=647)|
| 0:10:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=648)|

| 0:11:40| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| Hey, Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=701)|
| 0:11:42| How are you doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=702)|
| 0:11:43| Hey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| We've got a long meeting tonight, so I hope we can do this real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=704)|
| 0:11:47| I just noticed in this contract that we get paid for the lead acid batteries and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=707)|
| 0:11:52| the other ones are picked up at no charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=714)|
| 0:11:55| Is there no value in the other ones or why are we getting nothing for those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=715)|
| 0:11:59| Yes, Drew Thurman, 205 West Baxter, Director of Solid Waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=719)|
| 0:12:04| So think of it, another recycler once talked about recycling and you have the typical recycles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=724)|
| 0:12:13| that have value and then there's the stuff that doesn't and it's kind of like a chicken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=733)|
| 0:12:18| Nobody wants the feathers, but they want the chicken, so you've got to take the feathers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| and it's a similar case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| The lead acid in batteries that we collect at convenience centers as well as, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| I failed to mention in the summary, the fleet service also collects batteries from the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| fleet, but the real value is in that lead and when lead goes up, we have people come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| out from all the woodwork telling us they're going to give us all this money for lead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| Nobody really wants the double A's, the triple A's, or even the lithium ion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=762)|
| 0:12:45| They have probably some value once they've collected it and got a giant amount of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=765)|
| 0:12:52| but really not enough value for them to pay us to go and collect them because they get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=772)|

| 0:17:40| As a hue-ism to sum this up, ultimately we've got control of the property through the easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1060)|
| 0:17:45| I think the public, if they were to first see this, would think that, are we buying new land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| At least when you see the caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1069)|
| 0:17:50| We're not buying new acquisitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1070)|
| 0:17:53| We're just changing what we've got from an easement to actually fee simple ownership of the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1073)|
| 0:17:58| just to, once again, simplify this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1078)|

| 0:18:50| Mr. Caldwell on this particular item? Yes, Commissioner Skinmaker? Yeah, if Mr. Caldwell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1130)|
| 0:18:56| would like to brief us on where the funds are going, or if it's a refi, or? It's Chris| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1136)|
| 0:19:11| Caldwell, 400 Main Street. It's a refi for a lower rate that we have to go ahead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1151)|
| 0:19:16| pass now, I think before February, and so it'll be, once we get the amount, we'll bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1156)|
| 0:19:22| you back what those savings are, but it'll be substantial. Especially for leases or loans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1162)|
| 0:19:30| that we did in the past, not really bonds, but the same thing. Okay, and how high were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1170)|
| 0:19:35| those rates that we currently were paying? I don't think they were terribly high, I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1175)|
| 0:19:40| have to go back and look, and we'll get you what they were and what we think they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1180)|
| 0:19:45| to go to, but I want to think that we thought the savings were three to four million in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1185)|
| 0:19:52| that range. Okay, thank you. All right, thank you. As it relates to item 36, that motion's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1192)|
| 0:20:00| probably, oh, I'm sorry, Commissioner Smith? Chris, I'm sorry. Yeah. I want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1200)|
| 0:20:05| the public knows we're not extending the maturity of these loans either, they have the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1205)|

| 0:20:23| next item shall be handled in roughly the same manner. It's another resolution related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1223)|
| 0:20:28| to bond issuance, so the motion should be to send forward without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1228)|

| 0:21:24| please? Motion to approve. Second. Okay, we have a motion for approval from Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1284)|
| 0:21:27| Smith, and there's a second over here from Commissioner Biggs. Okay, Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1287)|
| 0:21:33| Yeah, I don't really have a, it was just a legal question about being the sponsor of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1293)|
| 0:21:38| the, being of the sponsor of the resolution. It was a question for the legal department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1298)|
| 0:21:44| Okay, all right. Go ahead, Mr. Law Director. Well, when you're looking at it, I'm assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| you're asking about a conflict. Yeah, just if it's a conflict of interest to be the 911| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1310)|
| 0:21:58| director and the sponsor of the bill. Okay, there's no conflict in being on 911 and being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1318)|
| 0:22:03| a commissioner. Okay, first. There's no conflict because there is no ethical violation in terms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1323)|
| 0:22:11| of financial gain to anybody sponsoring the bill. The other side is, is that the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1331)|
| 0:22:17| itself could be the one, I don't know who is issuing this, but as long as it is disclosed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1337)|
| 0:22:25| that I am some kind of agent or some kind of employee or some kind of relationship to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| this body, then it, then that rests with the commissioner in question as to whether they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1349)|
| 0:22:35| want to vote or not, but there's no ethical conflict in it. Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1355)|
| 0:22:42| Okay, and I've got two lights over here. I've got Commissioner Daley and then Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1362)|
| 0:22:45| Anders. So, Commissioner Daley. I guess my question would be to Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1365)|
| 0:22:51| Brad, will you kind of give us an update how old this equipment is? It's outdated and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| think we're buying, it finally passed that we're buying new equipment for? Yeah, thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1377)|
| 0:23:03| you. It's, and I appreciate adding another layer of transparency to this. So, recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1383)|
| 0:23:10| this equipment, Mr. Daley, is over 30 years old. It is recently 911 upgraded the radio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| system in the last 18 months and we finally took the last 10 channels offline. The first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| 10 channels were sold, put in a pallet and sold on GovDeals and scrapped for metal. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1403)|
| 0:23:27| thought that was, as the new director coming in, I thought that was a bad idea and so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1407)|
| 0:23:32| had Motorola reach out to other public safety answering points across the country that might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1412)|
| 0:23:39| need this equipment more than somebody scrapping the metal. And so, we found the Guam Police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1419)|
| 0:23:47| Department is using this equipment and could use more of it for parts. And so, I went to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1427)|
| 0:23:54| Matt Myers to make sure that we facilitated this correctly and this is nothing more than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1434)|
| 0:24:00| putting, giving access to Guam really. The price doesn't matter. It just allows Mr. Myers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1440)|
| 0:24:07| to be in contact with the Guam Police Department, which I think is really neat that we're helping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1447)|
| 0:24:14| one of our territories because we frequently, as 911 get emails asking if we have parts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1454)|
| 0:24:20| that are 10, 15, 20 years old for agencies that either can't find the parts or don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1460)|
| 0:24:27| have the money for those parts. And so, I thought it was silly for us to put them on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| a pallet and put them on GovDeals when there's another public safety answering service that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| needed them. And that's the reality. I think it's a good move and common sense move that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1476)|
| 0:24:41| sometimes we're not used to with the government. So, I appreciate the opportunity to announce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1481)|
| 0:24:46| that. Very good. All right. Any other questions? Okay. All right. The motion is properly before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1486)|

| 0:25:25| to us, so I'm going to go ahead and call on you first. We did need a motion. We did need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1525)|

| 0:25:38| Okay. Go ahead, Commissioner Bustle. Thank you. I was looking at, we have some ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1538)|
| 0:25:43| that are coming up here that we're trying to get, say, the A.J. building back on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| tax rolls. It got me thinking about the Knoxville Center, formerly known as the East Town Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1547)|
| 0:25:57| We're looking at this piece of property here. It's got, I think, 88 acres, 22 acres of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1557)|
| 0:26:02| is under roof. The buildings right now are becoming a liability because on January the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1562)|
| 0:26:08| 31st, it's going to be completely closing the center itself. We have a great opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1568)|
| 0:26:18| to negotiate a very, very good price on this property that we do have. And one of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1578)|
| 0:26:24| what I was thinking about it, if you take a look at our building that we are in right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| now, we have a lot of departments that are squeezed into areas that we've just had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1588)|
| 0:26:36| make new spots for. One of them is the Sheriff's Department. One of them is our Law Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1596)|
| 0:26:42| that has a lot of people working in that office that needs additional space. But what this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1602)|
| 0:26:52| does for us is it gives us an opportunity to take the government to the people. If you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1612)|
| 0:26:57| look at the access to this building for the taxpayers, it's very hard to get in here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1617)|
| 0:27:06| parking, walking, everything else, to get in here to access their government. And this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1626)|
| 0:27:13| would give a chance to have free parking. We'd have bus services out there for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1633)|
| 0:27:19| that don't drive that would still have the ability to get there. Since 2001, we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1639)|
| 0:27:27| do a yearly basis to stay in this building. We do a yearly renewal. I guess that's what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| you call it, to stay in here. So if we decide to go, then we have an opportunity to leave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| this building with conjunction of the city also if they want to go pursue this idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1658)|
| 0:27:48| After we look at some of the, even if the city, even if the school system does not decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1668)|
| 0:27:56| to go here but goes to the TVA building, we can consolidate I guess additional five buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| or properties that they do have, which would include the Sears building. We'd have rural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1681)|
| 0:28:09| high school. We also could bring in the Health Department for new facilities. We had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| public works that we could move off to Baxter Avenue to an item out there to where it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| be under one roof. We would have more room for the Sheriff's Department to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1699)|
| 0:28:24| They would be closer to Maloneyville Road. One of the things that really hit me right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1704)|
| 0:28:34| here is in that area, by moving out there, by moving the government out there, we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| have millions of dollars of economic impact on that area in East Knoxville. I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1720)|
| 0:28:47| Michelle's area and Ms. Gill's area too that's out there that would be affected by this where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| we could make that area more available and develop it a little bit more than it is right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1732)|
| 0:28:59| now. I've been taking notes and studying about this. For the city, we could have more space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1739)|
| 0:29:10| for them, for their police department. They're looking at the St. Mary's building. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1750)|
| 0:29:18| they said that they were looking to spend something in the $40 million range. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| we could do it a little bit better and more economical for the taxpayers also there. Also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1763)|
| 0:29:29| there are some things for the employees of the city county building. Somebody had a wish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1769)|
| 0:29:37| list once before. It says, were we moving the courts, city services, Knox County services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1777)|
| 0:29:44| We'd have a food court out there to where we could offer more kinds of food. We'd have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| where the regal theater was at. We'd have a place for our public building here where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| we're having our public meetings at. We'd have indoor walking. We'd have, again, free| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1794)|
| 0:30:00| parking for the citizens and a health facility also for the health facility. By that, we'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1800)|
| 0:30:08| have a workout gym and things like that for the employees there that we could do. We'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| have daycare for the employees here. Everything would be under one roof. Everything. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1813)|
| 0:30:23| an opportunity to look at it. What I'm asking is not to say we're going to go do it, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1823)|
| 0:30:29| see what it would really cost us to consolidate this government in one place where all citizens| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1829)|
| 0:30:36| could access their government freely and not have to pay for it again when they're paying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1836)|
| 0:30:43| taxes. What I'm asking right now is for this body to send this on and go through the mayor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1843)|
| 0:30:51| office and ask our purchasing department to really do a study on this. Now, to help out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1851)|
| 0:30:58| this, someone's here that could speak to this, how easy it is or how they could get this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1858)|
| 0:31:05| property in here. Justin, Kazana, could you come up here and give us a little information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1865)|
| 0:31:10| please? Mr. Kazana, if you could just state your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1870)|
| 0:31:17| Sure. My name is Justin Kazana, 7220 West Hampton Place. I work with Avison Young Commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| Real Estate. We are the property managers for East Town. We were hired by the owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| or contracted by the owners back in March to take over the property and assist with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| the transition. Okay. Now, you have all the properties except one. Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1891)|
| 0:31:39| So the ownership group has obviously the mall itself, which is included in the 80 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1899)|
| 0:31:44| as well as the Belk and the Dillards under contract. They do not have the Sears. That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| the only thing that they do not have control of at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| But Sears is in bankruptcy right now, so it would be an advantageous thing for them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1913)|
| 0:31:58| get some money out of that building, correct? You would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| So some of the outlying buildings, we're just talking about within the circle where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1924)|
| 0:32:10| the asphalt's at, right? We're not talking where the old tire barn and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| was out there? That's correct. We are talking about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| mall itself and everything attached to the mall. We're not including any of the Appleby's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| the Wendy's, anything around it. It is strictly the mall itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| So those areas could be developed into taxable. Those are available, though, aren't they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1945)|
| 0:32:32| No, not necessarily. Those are controlled by separate entities. So, you know, when you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| talk about the Appleby's, the Wendy's, everything, there's a church that's out there in the former| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| Just for Feet. Those are owned by totally separate groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| Okay. But there would be a push to probably develop it a little bit more outside the asphalt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1963)|
| 0:32:48| area. Sure. There are 4,500 parking spaces there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1968)|
| 0:32:51| so there is definitely land for out parcels. We've looked in detail at what can be created| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1971)|
| 0:32:56| in that parking field. Thank you. And it was a crazy thing when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1976)|
| 0:33:03| put this thing in and it went on the agenda. I've got a call from two commercial realtors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1983)|
| 0:33:13| that want to be the first ones to place a bid on this property. We're not talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=1993)|
| 0:33:20| moving in the next two or three years. It will probably take about five to ten years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2000)|
| 0:33:24| to get everything in line to move out there. But at this point in time, that property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2004)|
| 0:33:30| the best price that we'll probably get it at. It's in good shape now. If it goes, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2010)|
| 0:33:37| will move out and it will become a blighted area for that area and for Knox County to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2017)|
| 0:33:44| take care of. So all I'm asking for this body to do is say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2024)|
| 0:33:51| let's take a look at what it will cost and get some information of what it would cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| to redevelop it, what we could put this property online for as far as tax purposes, and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2036)|
| 0:34:03| the other properties that I mentioned here to put those back on the tax rolls. And we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2043)|
| 0:34:09| could get almost every building that we have out almost in that, because there's 22 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2049)|
| 0:34:16| under roof out there. So basically that's what I'm asking this body to do is push it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2056)|
| 0:34:22| on out there and let's do a study. And if it's feasible, let's go after it and move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2062)|
| 0:34:28| this to the public where they can get access to their government. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2068)|
| 0:34:34| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler. We had a few other commissioners weigh in who also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| wanted to add on this. I also recognize that we've got the mayor down there who probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| wants to talk about this item as well. But I do want to, in order of the lights, I recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2081)|
| 0:34:46| you've got Commissioner Anders, Biggs, and Gill have chimed in to ask questions or to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2086)|
| 0:34:51| speak to this item. So, Commissioner Anders? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think that Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| Bussler brings up a lot of valid points, but I'll stop it there. What the county and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2095)|
| 0:35:03| city and the state need to do, by his own admittance, he said that there's, number one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2103)|
| 0:35:09| we don't know that it's for sale. I don't know if Justin has been told to manage it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2109)|
| 0:35:12| or to be told to sell it. We have not been told to sell it, but it could be for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2112)|
| 0:35:20| And so, upon that discussion that Commissioner Bussler just said, as soon as commercial people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2120)|
| 0:35:28| heard it, they wanted to build on it. They wanted to buy it and develop it. They wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2128)|
| 0:35:34| to buy it and develop it and probably lease it back to us. Or, we could take the Mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| Road South, Mall Road North, make those two-way streets and have TDOT put in a slip ramp and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| redevelop it economically. And maybe we need to put some government offices out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2146)|
| 0:35:50| I think it's good to have an annex out there where people can come and get the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| services they need. But I think we're, because I think you're around $100, $120 million to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2155)|
| 0:36:01| build that building out or to finish it out. Just the mechanical alone will be astronomical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2161)|
| 0:36:06| None of the stores are connected. All of the, if you, the design of the mall is that all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2166)|
| 0:36:12| the doors have to be open on the stores for the heat and air to work throughout the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2172)|
| 0:36:17| And that's how the return and the flow goes. And so, to individualize all of that and just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2177)|
| 0:36:23| the heat and air mechanical would be astronomical. So, I'm more along the line of developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2183)|
| 0:36:28| a development district out there and putting in city, county, and state dollars to redo| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2188)|
| 0:36:35| the roads, make them less confusing, and make it more accessible with slip ramps and working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2195)|
| 0:36:40| with TDOT and keeping it in private hands. And I agree with you. I think we could put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2200)|
| 0:36:45| some government services out there that will add to the area and make it more convenient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2205)|
| 0:36:49| for residents. But I don't think that Knox County needs to be in the redevelopment business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2209)|
| 0:36:53| of land that's just now closing and going through a redevelopment process. That's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2213)|
| 0:37:00| opinion. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| All right. Thank you. I also want to clarify, I believe I heard Commissioner Busler, I want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| to restate what you said. Commissioner Busler, when you said you got calls from commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2223)|
| 0:37:07| brokers, you were talking about this building, not East Town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| This building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2229)|
| 0:37:10| Okay, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| This building, not that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Yeah. I was just clarifying so that we all understood what you'd said. All right. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2232)|
| 0:37:15| you. All right. Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2235)|
| 0:37:19| If the mayor would like to speak, do you want to go first? Me? Okay. So, I started looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| at this a little over two years ago, and there is, Commissioner Busler's correct, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2245)|
| 0:37:31| some great possibilities out there. With the freeway access, I think it's an amazing opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2251)|
| 0:37:36| for the public to take, you know, an opportunity to come out and easier in, access in and out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2256)|
| 0:37:42| But also, just a couple months ago, we heard from a study done about our jails that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2262)|
| 0:37:47| were going to take an additional $30 million to build a jail pod. And then right off the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2267)|
| 0:37:51| bat they said, you know, you actually probably need to. So that's $60 million. If we could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2271)|
| 0:37:56| make something that would be some sort of intake center out there in one of those garages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2276)|
| 0:38:00| like Sears, if you could pull the buses in there and have an intake center and your courts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| and everything like that, the possibilities are endless. They really are. But given that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2285)|
| 0:38:10| there's so much that would have to fall into place, the city government, PBA, or us, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2290)|
| 0:38:16| we do, if everyone remembers, we do have an annex out there. We built it on it last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2296)|
| 0:38:22| right across, right beside Home Depot. They just actually upgraded the square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| and they're adding some services out there as well. But given all that said, I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| like to see a study done. I would like to see how much it would cost, and then I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2312)|
| 0:38:35| like to see if we can't make something like that happen, the privatized dollars and something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| like Commissioner Anders said, with redoing it, that freeway access out there isn't utilized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| because it's very confusing and hard to navigate at points in time. But as far as Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2325)|
| 0:38:51| Busler saying, I believe having all of the government entities together in one building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| would be amazing and not have to go out and everything else. And just right off the bat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| thinking about the savings that the two pods would save, that's $60 million right there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2340)|
| 0:39:05| off the bat that we could retrofit something like that out that way. But it's just my food| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2345)|
| 0:39:09| for thought, and I appreciate all the hard work he's done on this resolution. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2349)|
| 0:39:15| Thank you. Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So let me acknowledge, because the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2358)|
| 0:39:25| about even when the name of Knoxville Center Mall was changed from Easttown Mall to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2365)|
| 0:39:32| Center Mall, the level of deterioration on the east side of town with the lack of really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2372)|
| 0:39:38| core investment in that area has resulted in what you see today. See, let's make the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2378)|
| 0:39:45| acknowledgment of that first. And I think if we have a vested interest, because he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2385)|
| 0:39:51| brought the resolution to the county, the community has had a longstanding conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2391)|
| 0:39:57| about the decline of that facility and the fact that we could have better utilized that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2397)|
| 0:40:04| property. And we acknowledge that we understand that the building is not for sale. But even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2404)|
| 0:40:09| before I became a commissioner, the opportunity to explore how to utilize that end of town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2409)|
| 0:40:17| and that building to serve the needs of all of our constituents has not been considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2417)|
| 0:40:23| So let me acknowledge that piece, because that really is where it is. And even when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2423)|
| 0:40:30| the Knox County School System had a school in that facility, we could have made more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2430)|
| 0:40:37| of an investment on the county level to look at how we can deal with some of the wraparound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2437)|
| 0:40:44| services that should have been in that facility. And the opportunity to look to build out a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2444)|
| 0:40:51| vocational component that could have served the needs of lots, because it's centrally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2451)|
| 0:40:55| located for lots of people in this community. So I think part of the initial conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2455)|
| 0:41:03| to look at our assessment is correct. But we also have long understood that that racetrack| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2463)|
| 0:41:12| to nowhere and the access to that facility has not been, was not even built out correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2472)|
| 0:41:20| And we continue to say, now we need to take a look at it. I think people have always understood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2480)|
| 0:41:27| we needed to take a look at that and that it was going to take the city, the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| public and private investment to make that facility work. But only when it comes to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2492)|
| 0:41:38| point of closure do we want to act. So that's really a very difficult statement to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2498)|
| 0:41:45| when we could have had an investment long term that we could have not even come to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2505)|
| 0:41:50| piece. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Gill. Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| I have a question for Mr. Caldwell, please. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2516)|
| 0:42:08| Mr. Caldwell, what is the approximate amount of baseline tax revenue that is generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2528)|
| 0:42:14| by this property every year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| I think approximately $300,000 if you count all parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| All parcels. OK. And how much tax revenue would be brought in if it was a government building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2540)|
| 0:42:25| Zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| Point of clarification. That's just county tax, not including city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| That is correct. That's the county piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| Has this property been assessed before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| Yes. We assessed it early on as a lease. They offered us a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2559)|
| 0:42:46| And so we assessed it that way. And that was in the initial rounds of assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2566)|
| 0:42:52| And then I had a conversation with Mr. Kazana this week, and we assessed it from an ownership standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2572)|
| 0:43:01| So we've assessed it both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2581)|
| 0:43:04| Thank you, Mr. Caldwell. I've heard in the year and a half I've been on commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2584)|
| 0:43:09| I've heard at least a dozen times when we've been talking about development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2589)|
| 0:43:14| we've been talking about new business acquisition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2594)|
| 0:43:17| we've been talking about attracting large employers to the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| I've heard at least a dozen times that we don't have enough flat land to bring in commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2601)|
| 0:43:26| Here's 88 acres of flat land in the heart of a commercial area with easy access to the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2606)|
| 0:43:34| Probably one of the most prime pieces of property that could be redeveloped into anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| manufacturing, additional commerce on any different level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| and we're talking about maybe turning it into a government building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| This is the part that just doesn't make sense to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| We have an enormous opportunity for the private sector to find great advantages in a piece of property with great access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2630)|
| 0:44:00| with amazing infrastructure on parking and just baseline flat property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2640)|
| 0:44:07| and I just can't imagine why we would turn that into a government entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2647)|
| 0:44:12| We've talked also on this commission about regional sports parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2652)|
| 0:44:16| something that our neighboring communities have, the nearest one being in Sevierville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2656)|
| 0:44:22| that attracts literally hundreds of thousands of people from all over the country to come and spend money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2662)|
| 0:44:28| to stay over, to go to restaurants, to do tournaments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2668)|
| 0:44:33| This entire complex could be easily retrofitted by somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2673)|
| 0:44:39| either a private partnership or a private-public partnership,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| or in a way that really attracts people to come here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| and I just think it's a massive, massive undertaking with a massive, massive price tag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2685)|
| 0:44:50| that is just not worthy of our efforts right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| So that's all I have to say. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Jay. Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| I know just a few years ago Barbara McMurray drew up an overlay for the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2701)|
| 0:45:09| and everything that the schools needed, I understood, fit up on the second floor of the mall there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2709)|
| 0:45:17| not including Belk and Dillard's, from what I've been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2717)|
| 0:45:24| I know that area, it really touches District 1, Commissioner Gill's, District 2, my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2724)|
| 0:45:31| and District 8, Richie Beeler's area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| The economic impact could be huge in that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2735)|
| 0:45:41| and the easy in and out of being able to access things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2741)|
| 0:45:48| So it is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| I remember the boom time and how exciting it was that we had Easttown Mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2752)|
| 0:45:59| However, malls are not the thing anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| People are going away, and they're going back to the old-timey way when we were growing up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2763)|
| 0:46:07| kind of your strip mall thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2767)|
| 0:46:09| So we're not talking about just moving government offices out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| We're talking about there's potential for a lot of multi-use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| There could be physician offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| There could be condos put in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| There's a lot that could be done in there and around the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2784)|
| 0:46:29| So, you know, the longer it sits, the more it's going to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2789)|
| 0:46:36| So we haven't even begun to discuss the cost of what the parking garage that we have to buy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2796)|
| 0:46:44| if we go with the TVA, we haven't even discussed what it's going to cost to redo all of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2804)|
| 0:46:49| That's not even being put out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| So, anyway, I think it's something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| This is an investment that we have been, that we are responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2815)|
| 0:47:00| We've been elected by our people to make sure we make the right decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2820)|
| 0:47:05| This is something that is going to affect my grandchildren and your all's grandchildren,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2825)|
| 0:47:10| and so it's not something that we just need to do very hurriedly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| So I think we need to give everything the opportunity to at least explore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2835)|
| 0:47:23| instead of just saying this isn't going to work, that's not going to work, and this is going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2843)|
| 0:47:28| So I just want to say from my people in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2848)|
| 0:47:33| they totally support us going through and trying to find out if it is feasible for us to be able to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2853)|
| 0:47:43| And so that's who we represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2863)|
| 0:47:48| We don't represent ourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| We represent our district, and we represent all of Knox County who are our taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2870)|
| 0:47:56| So I know that my area would very much welcome and would love to see it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2876)|
| 0:48:02| and it would do wonders for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2882)|
| 0:48:07| All right. Thank you, Commissioner Carrington.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2889)|
| 0:48:11| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| I think the concept and the idea is one that on the surface sounds really good, and it does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2894)|
| 0:48:22| but I look at the mall and I look at the square footage of it and the layout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| It's laid out for retail, not office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| That's hard to retrofit, and if you remember when the school board was looking for a place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2907)|
| 0:48:32| they didn't want to go to a big box store because of the interior offices would be dark with no window and no light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2912)|
| 0:48:39| You're going to run into the same thing in such a mall situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2919)|
| 0:48:44| Plus there's a lot of space in the hallways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2924)|
| 0:48:46| The corridors of that are huge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| I don't know what we would do with that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2928)|
| 0:48:51| There would be security issues probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| That place has so many doors and ins and outs, it would probably be tough to secure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2933)|
| 0:48:59| The cost alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2939)|
| 0:49:01| Chris, did we get any initial cost on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2941)|
| 0:49:08| The chair will recognize Mayor Jacobson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2948)|
| 0:49:11| If you don't mind me answering that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2951)|
| 0:49:14| The initial cost for what the county would need, which would be essentially 670,000 square feet, is $152 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2954)|
| 0:49:23| When we're bringing all this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| And that's using what type of remodel figure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| $175 per square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2968)|
| 0:49:30| Do we think that would be adequate to build secure court spaces?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2970)|
| 0:49:34| No, I think that's very conservative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2974)|
| 0:49:37| Is Tom Spangler here still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2977)|
| 0:49:39| Tom, could you retrofit a building to be a jail or an intake center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| and meet the standards of the state and the federal guidelines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=2983)|
| 0:50:01| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3001)|
| 0:50:03| It was something we'd certainly have to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3003)|
| 0:50:05| I can't tell you yes or no right now because we just haven't looked at anything to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3005)|
| 0:50:10| It would certainly be convenient for us as far as our intake, if that be the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3010)|
| 0:50:16| It would certainly save a lot of transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3016)|
| 0:50:22| So this building is actually owned by PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3022)|
| 0:50:28| It's not owned by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| We would have to get the city to go with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| If we could get the city to go with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3035)|
| 0:50:36| And they've already committed a lot of their resources to St. Mary's side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| If we could get the city to go with us, we could sell this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| We could sell Sarah Simpson, North Central, PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3042)|
| 0:50:48| Help me out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| Name some more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3049)|
| 0:50:50| Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3051)|
| 0:50:52| Magnolia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3052)|
| 0:50:55| We could do Rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3055)|
| 0:50:57| We could do all those buildings we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| What do you think we'd get for them all, altogether?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3060)|
| 0:51:04| Somebody come up with an idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| I'm going to guesstimate less than $25 million based on what we're getting for B&A over there across the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3067)|
| 0:51:13| I'm going to be generous and say we could get $60 million for all those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3073)|
| 0:51:18| If we could get $60 million for all those buildings, it'd cost us $160 million to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3078)|
| 0:51:23| I think we have too many road projects, too many schools that have needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| to go back to our citizens that we represent and tell them, look, I want to borrow $100 million and have you pay for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3086)|
| 0:51:33| so that we have nice bureaucratic government offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| So I think we need to look at it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3098)|
| 0:51:40| I mean, we can look at this, but we can't forget about the real problems that we have that we need to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| with traffic, our jail, and our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3106)|
| 0:51:52| And I think those should be higher priorities than office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| Okay. I'm going to go ahead and recognize Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| Commissioner Smith, you had asked him earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| So, Mayor Jacobs, the floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3124)|
| 0:52:06| I agree that Commissioner Busser brings up some very valid points, and I think that we all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3126)|
| 0:52:12| In fact, there was a time when I was conceptualizing this that I thought that it would be a great thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3132)|
| 0:52:19| But once you start digging into the numbers and the rest of the situation, it changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| And I agree with Commissioner Anders that what we really should be doing is looking at improving access to the mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3144)|
| 0:52:31| so it becomes viable for development in the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3151)|
| 0:52:35| The city is not going to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3155)|
| 0:52:37| You have an e-mail that I received today from David Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| I posed that question to him, and he talked to Mayor O'Hara and Mayor Leck in Cannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3159)|
| 0:52:45| and brings up a number of points, so they're probably not going to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3165)|
| 0:52:48| And without the city moving, you also have the lease agreement between the city and the county for this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| as Commissioner Smith said, which is actually PBAs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| Without the city moving, we cannot sell this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3176)|
| 0:52:59| We would be forced to essentially try to sublease it with a leasee who the city approves of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3179)|
| 0:53:08| And, yes, $152 million is $175 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3188)|
| 0:53:14| Again, talking with Mr. Brace today, the city working on their projects is already at $187,000 on their renovations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3194)|
| 0:53:24| $187 per square foot on their renovations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| So it's already significantly higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| And, yes, this is a very large structure that is not designed to be office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3209)|
| 0:53:36| It's designed to be a shopping mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| I mean, if we're thinking about what we're going to have to do with the HVAC system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3218)|
| 0:53:44| how much the electric bill is going to be because it's just huge, wide-open spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| all of those things, in my opinion, lead us that it should be kept in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3229)|
| 0:53:56| And if we were to move out of here and move over there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3236)|
| 0:53:59| all we're doing is just switching one government building for another one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3239)|
| 0:54:03| and we're not putting anything on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3243)|
| 0:54:05| So I very much sympathize with Commissioner Bussler's viewpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| and I think that we need to take a look at that area, but I think it needs to remain in the private market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3250)|
| 0:54:16| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| Thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| I see we've got a few lights from some commissioners who have already weighed in on this particular issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| and I'll do my best to get around everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3265)|
| 0:54:27| I mean, I tend to agree, my personal sentiments tend to agree with Mayor Jacobs on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3267)|
| 0:54:32| It is an area that needs focus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3272)|
| 0:54:35| but I guess when I see an area that's generating tax revenue right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3275)|
| 0:54:40| and think about us effectively taking that off the tax rolls, the net, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3280)|
| 0:54:46| our intention is to create incremental tax revenue where we actually put something back on the tax rolls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3286)|
| 0:54:52| and I just don't see a buyer for the building that we're in right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3292)|
| 0:54:58| But moving on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| I'm going to do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3301)|
| 0:55:02| I think Commissioner Biggs, did you weigh in with the second round first?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| I think this will be my second round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| Yeah, but I think everybody's weighed in on this, so I'm trying to come back around in fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3307)|
| 0:55:11| So I think I saw your light come on first, second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| I know Commissioner Gill, I'll just go in order of the first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3314)|
| 0:55:21| Actually, what we'll do is Commissioner Bussler, you were the first one to speak on this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| so I'm going to come back to you and then Anders and then Biggs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| and work our way back in the order that the first statements came in on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| So go ahead, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3333)|
| 0:55:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3335)|
| 0:55:36| And, you know, when I came in, I thought about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3336)|
| 0:55:39| and how much it's going to cost to acquire that land out there for use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3339)|
| 0:55:45| It's gone very cheaply now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| I mean, they've offered that land out there to a lot of people for a lot lesser money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3348)|
| 0:55:55| and it's not going to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3355)|
| 0:55:57| The big box stores are gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3357)|
| 0:56:00| But the thing that you've got to remember is the schools, when they move, wherever they move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3360)|
| 0:56:07| have a big economic impact on that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3367)|
| 0:56:11| And I think they said, what was it, $80 million or something like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3371)|
| 0:56:15| It was some huge amount or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3375)|
| 0:56:17| I forgot what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3377)|
| 0:56:19| But if we move this building out there, then we pump in that area a lot of economics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3379)|
| 0:56:29| and the impact on that and in that area is quite significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3389)|
| 0:56:36| This building right here, there's other cities that are a lot larger than we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3396)|
| 0:56:45| and they're running into some development stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3405)|
| 0:56:48| But this property that we're sitting on is a heck of a lot more valuable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3408)|
| 0:56:55| than the property that's out there at the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| And what we'll be doing is taking this property and putting it on the market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3418)|
| 0:57:05| and people are willing to buy this because of the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| And there's other areas and other governments in other states that are moving away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3430)|
| 0:57:15| from those high dollar property that they're sitting on into lesser property amounts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3435)|
| 0:57:22| and let the public or the private sector pay the taxes that deserve to be paid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3442)|
| 0:57:28| on this property we're sitting on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| The taxpayers paid for this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3451)|
| 0:57:34| We're just saying, hey, let's take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3454)|
| 0:57:37| Let's do some real hard studies before we make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| All I ever hear from this group is, well, we can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| All I'm asking is what I've asked for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3465)|
| 0:57:48| Let's take a real hard look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| But tell your taxpayers out there, we're not going to even try to take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| We've already made our minds up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3475)|
| 0:57:59| I'm the old man here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3479)|
| 0:58:00| I'm supposed to be the one setting my ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3480)|
| 0:58:02| I'm not going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| But I think we need to take a look and think outside the box a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| Well, it's going to cost $175 a square foot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3488)|
| 0:58:12| Do we really and truly know what the cost is going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3492)|
| 0:58:18| Do we really know what the impact is going to be on that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3498)|
| 0:58:22| taking all the people out there and let them spend their money in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3502)|
| 0:58:27| to help booster that area out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3507)|
| 0:58:32| I live out in the 7th District, but I see the needs in the East Knoxville area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3512)|
| 0:58:38| But if we don't even look at it, if we turn our backs on it and walk away from it, we never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3518)|
| 0:58:45| And we will not know until we really take a study, a real hard study at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3525)|
| 0:58:52| what the impact of this property coming open and that one being taken up by the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3532)|
| 0:58:58| that will pump a lot of that money into that area to build it back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3538)|
| 0:59:03| We'd be out there next to where the zoos and all like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| Never mind, I'm not going to get in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3548)|
| 0:59:10| Either you want to do it, you want to try to decide if you're going to do something for the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3550)|
| 0:59:15| or we're going to sit here the rest of our lives and find out one of these days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| hey, that probably could have been the best move we ever made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| or we could find out it's going to be the worst move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3562)|
| 0:59:25| But we don't know until we test it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| And I was in an audit meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3568)|
| 0:59:30| They were always talking about testing their theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| How are we going to test it if we're just going to talk about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| So that's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| You know, it just takes six votes to kill it or six votes to pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3579)|
| 0:59:44| So it's up to the rest of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3584)|
| 0:59:45| I'm just bringing it to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3585)|
| 0:59:47| And I'm trying to do something maybe for the taxpayers of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3587)|
| 0:59:51| that we have not been really doing as far as access to their government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3591)|
| 0:59:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3595)|
| 0:59:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3596)|
| 0:59:57| Thank you, Commissioner Boesler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3597)|
| 0:59:58| Commissioner Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3598)|
| 0:59:59| Mr. Kazana, if you don't mind, I'm looking at the map on KGIS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| With the 88 acres, are you discussing if you are able to acquire belk and dillards and pennies?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3604)|
| 1:00:12| Yes, that's included in the 80 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| So you don't have those yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| They're under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3617)|
| 1:00:18| Belk and dillards is under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3618)|
| 1:00:19| Pennies is owned by the mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3619)|
| 1:00:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| So minus a few acres, you're ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3624)|
| 1:00:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3626)|
| 1:00:27| I was going to make a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3627)|
| 1:00:30| You know, I would support a resolution that came before us not to purchase the possibility of purchasing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3630)|
| 1:00:37| Knoxville Center Mall for the purpose of relocating all departments and agencies of the government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3637)|
| 1:00:41| but I will support a resolution that asks for an economic study or an impact study if we come over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3641)|
| 1:00:52| and partner with the city and the state on the roads and an opportunity similar to the things that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3652)|
| 1:00:59| downtown with the opportunity zones in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| And I don't know who do we facilitate that through, the chamber or through the development corporation or KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3662)|
| 1:01:10| And really, the interesting thing is here is we're inside the city on this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| and I know whether it's city residents or county residents, but I think it would be wise for us to have a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3676)|
| 1:01:21| to see what we could do there and see what the possibilities are for affordable housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3681)|
| 1:01:27| mixed-use development, possibly a government annex-type building out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| But I think it's going to take some investment on infrastructure out there to make it safe and give us access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3692)|
| 1:01:40| And so I won't support a resolution that says purchasing Knoxville Center Mall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3700)|
| 1:01:46| but I will support a resolution that talks about creating a redevelopment district out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3706)|
| 1:01:52| And so that would be where I would lean towards supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3718)|
| 1:01:59| Are you calling on Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3719)|
| 1:02:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3720)|
| 1:02:01| I was going to say that would be through KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3721)|
| 1:02:03| It would be a redevelopment zone plan, and it would be getting the city and the county to partner with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3723)|
| 1:02:09| We can talk to the state as well, but it would be through KCDC because it's in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3729)|
| 1:02:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3734)|
| 1:02:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3735)|
| 1:02:16| Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| Thank you, Chairman Ostrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3737)|
| 1:02:18| I just want to just kind of, I think what Commissioner Bussler is talking about is the opportunity for a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| to look at the possibility of what could be done in the building, maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| if I'm hearing him correctly, with the city and county governments both going out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3748)|
| 1:02:33| But I just want to kind of try to paint a picture for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| If a few years ago we took a building that was on the tax roll off the tax roll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3756)|
| 1:02:42| and we put government offices in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| and then we feel like that that company or that specific government agency has then served its course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3765)|
| 1:02:51| so we decided to get that piece of property back on the tax roll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3771)|
| 1:02:54| and we decided to lease something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| You would have the TVA tower deal, which we're voting on next, right here in our laps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| That's what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3780)|
| 1:03:01| So now what we're talking about is our downtown's in a total different situation than it was some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3781)|
| 1:03:07| Market Square is vibrant and alive and doing an amazing job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3787)|
| 1:03:11| and you will hear me say multiple places that the city is the engine that helps drive the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3791)|
| 1:03:17| Unfortunately, I don't have Jeff Bezos' number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| and I can't get him to bring Amazon out here or anything like that, but that would be great, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3800)|
| 1:03:25| But what I think we're looking at is the opportunity to sell this great piece of riverfront property called the City County Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3805)|
| 1:03:33| It holds a block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3813)|
| 1:03:34| It's got some great parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| And then we're looking at the opportunity to sell on the A.J. Building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| and other properties that we may own downtown and investing in a property called Knoxville Center that has freeway access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3819)|
| 1:03:48| I don't buy the e-mail where Mr. Brace, I wish he was here, says more people are turning to social media and not coming to the City County Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3828)|
| 1:03:58| I'm here daily, and the halls are packed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| People are up here in courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| They're paying speeding tickets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| They're coming to probate court, paying taxes, pulling deeds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3844)|
| 1:04:08| The City County Building is a hub for people to come up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| But with that being said, there's enough businesses downtown that Market Square and the restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3852)|
| 1:04:17| and things like that could sustain without us being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3857)|
| 1:04:21| So I support a study to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| I would like to see what the possibilities are, but I would also like to cap it at a specific dollar amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3864)|
| 1:04:30| and just not get too crazy with the study being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| But that's just my input on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| We're basically doing the exact same thing, looking in the exact same direction that we're doing with the A.J. Building many years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3876)|
| 1:04:43| We're just doing the exact same thing right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3885)|
| 1:04:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3887)|
| 1:04:48| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3888)|
| 1:04:49| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3889)|
| 1:04:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| I need to ask Commissioner Bussler a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| We appreciate your advocacy on anything on the end of east and north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3894)|
| 1:04:59| Would you be looking at a resolution to ñ because the opportunity zone meeting and training is, I think, in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3899)|
| 1:05:08| or Thursday morning, to look at the designation of what's going on in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3908)|
| 1:05:13| as well as a zoning structure for that entire area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3913)|
| 1:05:18| Because you're going to need an entire assessment of its land, its value, its transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3918)|
| 1:05:24| and connecting some additional pieces if you would look at changing the resolution that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3924)|
| 1:05:31| In what way do you ñ what were you talking about in the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3931)|
| 1:05:35| I said I'm looking to see what the feasibility would be to get the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3935)|
| 1:05:41| and then go into the redevelopment of it and moving this engine that this government spends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3941)|
| 1:05:50| maybe $100 million worth of impact to your area or to Michelle's area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3950)|
| 1:05:57| Let's just say the county in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3957)|
| 1:05:59| Okay, the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| Would you change your resolution or friendly amendment to look at your feasibility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3965)|
| 1:06:06| Your initial assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3966)|
| 1:06:07| That's what I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3967)|
| 1:06:08| I'm not asking you to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3968)|
| 1:06:09| Right at the end I said let's take a look at it and really take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| Let's just don't go, yeah, I've got this paper right by hand and it says it's this, this, and this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3974)|
| 1:06:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3980)|
| 1:06:21| Really do an in-depth study of what it would be like to move this engine out in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3981)|
| 1:06:27| and let the private sector move into this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| What would be the best parts of doing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| And I've had two people from outside the state call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3994)|
| 1:06:38| and want to be the first ones to put a bid on this building, on this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=3998)|
| 1:06:44| And I said I can't guarantee you anything like this, but if it does go on the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| you have an opportunity to come down here and bid on this building or this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4009)|
| 1:06:54| So all I'm saying is let's do the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| If it could work, work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4017)|
| 1:06:59| If it doesn't work, then it doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| But we can't do a two-week study and say we make our minds up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| We've got to go and to people that know about real estate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4024)|
| 1:07:08| and how much this could put back on the tax market for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4028)|
| 1:07:13| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4033)|
| 1:07:14| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4034)|
| 1:07:15| Chair recognizes Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4035)|
| 1:07:18| If I could please reiterate, the city would have to agree to leaving this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4038)|
| 1:07:25| and they are not showing that they are amenable to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| So the idea that we're going to be able to sell this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| should be taken off the table at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4051)|
| 1:07:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4053)|
| 1:07:35| All right, thank you, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4055)|
| 1:07:37| All right, coming back, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| I feel like I'm at a funeral where everybody's picking over the furniture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4064)|
| 1:07:46| before we've even finished the service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4066)|
| 1:07:49| This property is barely open to the potential for commercial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4069)|
| 1:07:56| for manufacturing development, for additional shopping development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4076)|
| 1:07:59| for any kind of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4079)|
| 1:08:01| We're sitting here debating massive, huge, titanic-level ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4081)|
| 1:08:07| that are, frankly, a little absurd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4087)|
| 1:08:10| I mean, you're talking about moving 25 different entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4090)|
| 1:08:13| all in a coordinated effort in a short amount of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4093)|
| 1:08:16| on a property that we don't even know is for sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4096)|
| 1:08:19| or for what price with imaginary numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4099)|
| 1:08:21| I mean, I think to spend time and resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4101)|
| 1:08:24| when we know we have real issues in the county that need real attention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| and real money and resources is, frankly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4107)|
| 1:08:32| I think it's just a waste of time and effort right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| And I have one qualifying question for everybody that is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| and you can answer it or not, but for everybody who's in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4119)|
| 1:08:42| Are you really proposing to build an additional jail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| in East Knoxville in District 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4125)|
| 1:08:48| That's what I heard from several people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| I can't even imagine why that would be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| The Sheriff's Department, I heard several people talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4137)|
| 1:09:00| outfitting courts and jails and moving things from here to there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4140)|
| 1:09:03| essentially creating another jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| Instead of building two pods, let's put another jail in East Town Mall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4145)|
| 1:09:08| and move the courts over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| This area does not need jails and courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4150)|
| 1:09:13| It needs commerce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| But it's okay to put an additional intake center downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| Commissioner Biggs, Commissioner Jay has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4158)|
| 1:09:20| He asked for the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4160)|
| 1:09:22| I don't know if it's an open debate or just a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| I think these are massive, huge pie-in-the-sky ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4165)|
| 1:09:29| that are just not based in reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4169)|
| 1:09:31| And I think we ought to get back to the business of the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4171)|
| 1:09:33| which is really focusing on issues that need real resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4173)|
| 1:09:37| and real time and effort put forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| schools, roads, things that Commissioner Smith said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4179)|
| 1:09:42| Okay, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4182)|
| 1:09:44| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| A pie-in-the-sky we will not know until we have a study done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4187)|
| 1:09:54| Each of us has got an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4194)|
| 1:09:57| I've got my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4197)|
| 1:09:59| I've been talking to my neighborhood, and just like Michelle's neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4199)|
| 1:10:03| they want to know is it feasible enough to move county government out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4203)|
| 1:10:09| And there's nothing wrong with us checking out if it's feasible to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4209)|
| 1:10:14| Yeah, I've had a slight few that wants me to vote for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4214)|
| 1:10:18| but they're all government officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4218)|
| 1:10:21| It's kind of funny that it's all government officials that want me to vote yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4221)|
| 1:10:25| But when I go out and talk to all my homeowner's groups,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4225)|
| 1:10:27| which there are very many of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4227)|
| 1:10:29| and my coffee clubs on Friday mornings and Saturdays and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4229)|
| 1:10:35| you know, you float the idea about them, and their eyes open up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4235)|
| 1:10:38| and they go, you know, that may be a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4238)|
| 1:10:41| So there's nothing wrong with looking at a study to see if it's feasible or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4241)|
| 1:10:45| So I totally support looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| I owe it to the citizens of the 9th District and Knox County to look at all options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4248)|
| 1:10:54| And it may not work, but it might work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4254)|
| 1:10:59| But until we know, until we do this study, the feasibility, we don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4259)|
| 1:11:05| We all got opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4265)|
| 1:11:06| I've got my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4266)|
| 1:11:07| I'm trying to look at it both ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4267)|
| 1:11:11| But I think I will make sure that I will vote that my citizens in the 9th District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4271)|
| 1:11:18| and Knox County know that, hey, we could have had that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4278)|
| 1:11:25| or know it was a bad deal, then we can say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| So I will support Mr. Boesler's resolution if he wants to be amended by suggestion or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4288)|
| 1:11:36| but we do need to take a look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4296)|
| 1:11:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4299)|
| 1:11:40| Thank you, Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4300)|
| 1:11:41| Back to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4304)|
| 1:11:45| Hey, Nick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| Nick, can you hear me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4309)|
| 1:11:53| When you say you have the other four pieces of property under contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4313)|
| 1:11:55| you mean listing contract or to be purchased?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4315)|
| 1:11:58| No, for purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| The current ownership group has negotiated with the existing owners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4321)|
| 1:12:05| which is Belk and Dillard's, and have agreed to terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4325)|
| 1:12:08| They're in due diligence right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4328)|
| 1:12:09| So they're at this point really not looking to liquidate property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| It looks like they're consolidating property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4334)|
| 1:12:16| They're looking to, for the lack of a better word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4336)|
| 1:12:20| to gain control of the entire site so that a true redevelopment can take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| I mean, I have no problem with the study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| but I think in the end the analysis will show that this is not a feasible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| avenue to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| I agree with Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| I would be supportive of a study to see how we as the government could help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4357)|
| 1:12:42| redevelopment, what we could offer to that property in order to make it a ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4362)|
| 1:12:49| I mean, it's not even technically been on the market any amount of time yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| has it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4373)|
| 1:12:54| Well, it's not on the market at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4374)|
| 1:12:57| The owners are certainly looking at any options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| whether it's Commissioner Anders' idea or Commissioner Bussler's idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4380)|
| 1:13:03| to make this a strong part of the community like it was when it was built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4383)|
| 1:13:10| And I wonder if we're studying and if that scares off potential buyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4390)|
| 1:13:13| or somebody that does want to redevelop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4393)|
| 1:13:17| But, you know, Commissioner Jay said it, I've thought it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4397)|
| 1:13:22| we need a sports complex place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4402)|
| 1:13:25| I think that would be a great location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4405)|
| 1:13:26| We look at one of the things that contributed to the mall failing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| I'll use that word, and that is our retail market and delivery systems changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4412)|
| 1:13:39| You know, that might be a great distribution center site for somebody like Amazon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4419)|
| 1:13:46| I don't know if spending money to study this is worth it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4426)|
| 1:13:52| but if you all feel it is, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4432)|
| 1:13:54| But I think in the end, if we get something where it says we're going to have to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4434)|
| 1:13:59| and borrow $50 million, $100 million to do it, I think we have other priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4439)|
| 1:14:04| I can name some infrastructure needs, some school needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4444)|
| 1:14:08| some things that I would rather spend money on than paying debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| for a government office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| And I'll just end with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4458)|
| 1:14:19| I do want to come back, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4459)|
| 1:14:20| I've heard Commissioner Smith and Commissioner Anders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4460)|
| 1:14:22| and some of the commissioners talk about potentially something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4462)|
| 1:14:25| And, John, I'll get to you in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| I guess what I want to find out after I've recognized Commissioner Schoonmaker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| is if someone wants to make a substitute motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4472)|
| 1:14:36| if they wanted to officially amend Commissioner Busler's motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4476)|
| 1:14:41| But I'm going to go back to Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| This is his first light on this subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| Because this is just the work session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4488)|
| 1:14:50| we could actually delay the vote on this until next Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4490)|
| 1:14:54| And in the time period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| maybe Commissioner Busler would have an opportunity to get a rough idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4496)|
| 1:15:00| of what the cost would be to do a study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| either getting with procurement or somebody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4504)|
| 1:15:07| to just know if we're talking about a quick $20,000 or $100,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4507)|
| 1:15:13| just to give us a number of what it would cost to actually pursue this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4513)|
| 1:15:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4521)|
| 1:15:22| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4523)|
| 1:15:25| As I've weighed in, I'm kind of a simpleton on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4525)|
| 1:15:31| I tend to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4531)|
| 1:15:32| I agree with Mr. Mayor Jacobs, and I agree with, frankly, the email from David Brace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| I just don't see the city wanting to move out of here to East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4538)|
| 1:15:43| which could significantly complicate any deal to sell or lease out this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4543)|
| 1:15:48| That's just what my analysis is on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| But with that said, speaking not as the Chair but as the 4th District Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4552)|
| 1:15:58| I do want to go back to Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| I would take the motion to where we need to find out how much we're going to spend on the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| I'm not here to want to spend $50,000 or $100,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4566)|
| 1:16:09| but to be able to go out there and feel the pulse of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| and feel the pulse of the economics in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| Right now the pulse is dead in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4580)|
| 1:16:24| It's not dead. We sleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4584)|
| 1:16:26| It ain't dead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| Hey, you know, I could get her woke up for a minute when I say something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4588)|
| 1:16:36| But anyway, what I'm asking for right now is we come back here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4596)|
| 1:16:43| and I'm going to be off two years and eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| I'll be off of this panel right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4605)|
| 1:16:48| Ten years down the road, the malls, the building's been sitting vacant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| It's falling in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4612)|
| 1:16:53| It's going to have to be demoed or stuff like that, which it could be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4613)|
| 1:16:58| Once they move out, it starts deteriorating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4618)|
| 1:17:02| They turn off the air conditioners and all like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| Maybe we could salvage some of the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| I'm not an architect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4630)|
| 1:17:11| I'm not a designer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4631)|
| 1:17:13| But I do know that people can redesign buildings to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4633)|
| 1:17:18| We never thought the A.J. building being a hotel could be an office place for the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4638)|
| 1:17:23| but they made it work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4643)|
| 1:17:25| So, hey, whatever you all decide to do, you're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4645)|
| 1:17:29| It's either for the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4649)|
| 1:17:33| I'm just saying let's just take a look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4653)|
| 1:17:35| But if you decide not to take a look, go back out there ten years from now when that building is deteriorating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4655)|
| 1:17:42| and tell them we decided not to do that, and that's why it's in the shape it's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4662)|
| 1:17:46| So, anyway, do what you want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4666)|
| 1:17:49| I know I'll take the amendment to take a look at that, what Ms. Gill said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4669)|
| 1:17:55| Commissioner Gill, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| But I'll take that point on that as an amendment to it, as a friendly amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4677)|
| 1:18:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4683)|
| 1:18:04| I want to come back to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4684)|
| 1:18:05| But I've heard from Commissioner Gill, Commissioner Smith, and Commissioner Anders about either a friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4685)|
| 1:18:11| and or a substitute amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4691)|
| 1:18:13| So I want to get something clear on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4693)|
| 1:18:17| Commissioner Smith, back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4697)|
| 1:18:20| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4700)|
| 1:18:21| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4701)|
| 1:18:22| Commissioner, I mean, Chris, Mr. Caldwell, how would we pay for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4702)|
| 1:18:33| Not the study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4713)|
| 1:18:38| Pay for what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| You're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4719)|
| 1:18:40| We're talking about study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4720)|
| 1:18:41| The study and any debt service we would add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4721)|
| 1:18:44| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4724)|
| 1:18:46| The study, we could appropriate money from the general fund to pay for the study, assuming it's a reasonable expense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4726)|
| 1:18:55| When you talk about where would Knox County find $150 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4735)|
| 1:19:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| Tax increase, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| That would be one option because we don't have an extra $10 million a year over 20 years to pay for such an acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4747)|
| 1:19:22| So tax increase, you could, I guess, take all the growth and not give raises to teachers and uniformed officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4762)|
| 1:19:34| and take that approach and cover it through growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4774)|
| 1:19:37| So that would be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4777)|
| 1:19:40| Or you could cut other capital items in the capital plan and reduce it to pay for it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4780)|
| 1:19:50| That's the only thing that I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4790)|
| 1:19:52| Because, I mean, if it's going to be with interest over $200 million, I'm grinched today, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4792)|
| 1:20:07| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4807)|
| 1:20:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4808)|
| 1:20:09| Mr. Skinmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4810)|
| 1:20:11| Mr. Caldwell, back to the podium, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4811)|
| 1:20:17| Could you not have another option where you purchase the entire 88 acres, made a decision to use 40 percent of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4817)|
| 1:20:26| sell off the other parcels, the other parts of the building, take the out parcels that are now parking lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4826)|
| 1:20:33| and sell that for commercial uses for restaurants, a hotel, whatever it needs to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4833)|
| 1:20:40| Is that not another option instead of saying that we wouldn't give teachers a raise?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| You could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| But nobody's buying them now, so why would they buy them from us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| I mean, that's just us putting up cash for no reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4851)|
| 1:20:54| That doesn't make any sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4854)|
| 1:20:56| I mean, if they're going to buy them now, they're going to buy them from Justin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4856)|
| 1:21:00| They don't have to buy them from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4860)|
| 1:21:02| They're not doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4862)|
| 1:21:03| And so he asked me a question of how we could pay for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| I gave you the answers, and it's just the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4867)|
| 1:21:10| And you may not like the answer, but that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| Why would we buy that if people aren't buying it now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| I mean, I just don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4878)|
| 1:21:26| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4886)|
| 1:21:27| Good point, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| All right, we've come to a close on this debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| I'd like to get a vote taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| I think there needs to be a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| Can I make a substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| We'll make a substitute motion until we move this forward without recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| so we can get a cost of the study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| and the potential for an Opportunity Zone designation conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| as well, inside that next resolution on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4909)|
| 1:21:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4910)|
| 1:21:51| So we have a motion from Commissioner Anders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| and we have a second from Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| Mr. Busler, are you good with where we're moving this conversation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4919)|
| 1:22:00| I just want to explore this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4920)|

| 1:22:06| We're not just going to buy that and develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4926)|
| 1:22:10| We're putting a heck of a lot more property back on tax rolls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| that are not on tax rolls right now of buildings we own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4935)|
| 1:22:20| especially this building we're sitting in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4940)|
| 1:22:22| and how much we're going to get from selling this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4942)|
| 1:22:26| So if we're just talking about flat costs, that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4946)|
| 1:22:30| But, hey, I said five to ten years is what it's going to do to get here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4950)|

| 1:22:41| Is there any additional discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=4961)|

| 1:23:41| Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5021)|

| 1:23:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5026)|
| 1:23:47| Commissioner Daly votes aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5027)|
| 1:23:56| 8-2, it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| Okay, Madam Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5039)|
| 1:24:11| Item number 41 is a resolution authorizing Knox County to enter into a contract with the Tennessee Valley Authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5051)|
| 1:24:20| granting Knox County a term easement for use of the TVA East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| Permanent easement for TVA Summer Place Complex and Fridgelite term easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5064)|
| 1:24:31| This is resolution 904.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| Okay, we have a motion for approval by Commissioner Anders and there was a second, I think it was that Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5078)|
| 1:24:43| Okay, discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| Okay, I'm going to go ahead and ask Mayor Jacobs to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5087)|
| 1:25:07| Mayor Jacobs, it's item 41.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| For the TVA?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5111)|
| 1:25:12| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| Is there any consideration of moving forward with the contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| Yes, we've got a motion and a second for approval on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| So initially there were not any lights so I wanted to recognize you to go ahead and give you a chance to go ahead and talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5121)|
| 1:25:27| Can I ask a point of order, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5127)|
| 1:25:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5129)|
| 1:25:30| Should the motion be no recommendation since this is a contract that would have to go through the formal process of our formal commission meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5130)|
| 1:25:38| It wouldn't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5138)|
| 1:25:41| It's not an ordinance or a bond issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5141)|
| 1:25:43| It doesn't have to have a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5143)|
| 1:25:46| It's not going to have unanimous anyway unless I'm not reading the tea leaves right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5146)|
| 1:25:53| So it's going to be back again next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5153)|
| 1:25:56| It will not go on to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| It doesn't require a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5158)|
| 1:26:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5167)|
| 1:26:08| Go ahead, Mayor Jacobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5168)|
| 1:26:09| I think we have a wonderful opportunity here to secure some space that is vitally needed to free up the AHA building to get it back on the tax rolls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5169)|
| 1:26:20| to have a positive impact on our budget, as well as it looks very favorable for UT to come over, which would be a great relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5180)|
| 1:26:28| So all in all, I think this is a wonderful opportunity that we have to really make an impact on Knox County, save the taxpayers some money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5188)|
| 1:26:37| and move the county forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| Go ahead, Commissioner Bessler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5204)|
| 1:26:46| Can I get a point of order here, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| There is some blanks that are in this 200 pages that we got last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5209)|
| 1:26:56| Aren't those supposed to be filled in before we vote on something that's not complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5216)|
| 1:27:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5222)|
| 1:27:03| I'm going to go look to Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5223)|
| 1:27:05| Were there any additional documents that needed to come over?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5225)|
| 1:27:09| I think Mr. Manitoff may have had some as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5229)|
| 1:27:12| Can I make a point of order, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5232)|
| 1:27:14| I'd like to change my motion to send without recommendation after reconsidering my vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5234)|
| 1:27:19| and I think Commissioner Jay was the second, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5242)|
| 1:27:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5243)|
| 1:27:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5244)|
| 1:27:25| I want to speak for Mark, but he met today, and I think they're finalizing contracts today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5245)|
| 1:27:31| and he's going to send that out either tomorrow or Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| That will be the final documents, and those blanks should be complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5255)|
| 1:27:44| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5264)|
| 1:27:45| I'm Mark Manitoff, 1215 Great Oaks Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| I do need to meet again with Charlie Sturkey in the law department office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5269)|
| 1:27:53| and get any additional comments Charlie may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| He's been great working together with me on this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5276)|
| 1:28:00| and we have made quite a bit of progress in the last few days since those drafts went out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5280)|
| 1:28:05| I do think we can have you drafts probably Wednesday, probably not tomorrow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5285)|
| 1:28:11| because I'm not meeting with Charlie until about 2 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5291)|
| 1:28:14| The blanks will be filled in, the exhibits will be attached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| and you would have final documents if you choose to consider this next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5297)|
| 1:28:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5302)|
| 1:28:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5303)|
| 1:28:24| I recognize in order Commissioner Busler and Commissioner Gill's lights are both on on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5304)|
| 1:28:30| I'll go ahead and recognize Commissioner Busler first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| I've just got a question on all these documents that come out through here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| It says TVA, confidential, deliberate, and a pre-decisional document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5317)|
| 1:28:42| When it says confidential on that from the federal government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| did we get approval to put this out to the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5325)|
| 1:28:49| Mr. Maramatov.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5329)|
| 1:28:54| Commissioner Busler, obviously that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| When we first started meeting with them, we told them that those confidentiality provisions had absolutely no effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5336)|
| 1:29:01| We have an open records law, obviously, in Tennessee that they can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5341)|
| 1:29:04| So if they chose to give us those documents, they became open records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5344)|
| 1:29:08| And so they understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| We've asked them to stop putting it on there, but we never contractually agreed to keep them confidential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5350)|
| 1:29:14| They understood they were all subject to open records laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5354)|
| 1:29:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5357)|
| 1:29:18| I just want to make sure because I wouldn't want to have a document on hand I'm not supposed to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| Yeah, I certainly understand that, and you certainly are entitled to have that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5362)|
| 1:29:27| Anyone in this room could have gotten it through an open records request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5367)|
| 1:29:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5371)|
| 1:29:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5372)|
| 1:29:33| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5373)|
| 1:29:34| Yes, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5376)|
| 1:29:37| Do we have any outstanding concerns or issues that we need to be aware of before we move to the vote on Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5377)|
| 1:29:48| Do I love these agreements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5388)|
| 1:29:49| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5389)|
| 1:29:50| This is one of the hardest things I've ever worked on, and I felt terrible saying these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5390)|
| 1:29:54| 33 years that I've been doing this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5394)|
| 1:29:56| TVA is extraordinarily difficult to negotiate with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5396)|
| 1:30:01| But it's been very arduous and something that's been a great challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5401)|
| 1:30:07| I know I had a long conversation right before I went for a short vacation with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5407)|
| 1:30:12| I know that he has some residual concerns about certain issues, and I certainly greatly value his input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5412)|
| 1:30:18| If he has concerns, then therefore I have concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5420)|
| 1:30:21| But I do believe, and obviously the law director here can speak for himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5421)|
| 1:30:26| I mean, we obviously would have preferred a lease than an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5426)|
| 1:30:32| A lease is a simpler legal instrument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| I do believe legally an easement works fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5434)|
| 1:30:36| We're going to get title insurance ensuring the value of the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5436)|
| 1:30:39| We're going to get a legal opinion from TVA's general counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5439)|
| 1:30:42| I'm going to ask them to make some adjustments to that opinion to address some of the law director's valid concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| about the authority for them to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| So I think that's something that we can address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5449)|
| 1:30:51| I think we've, you know, the law department has been adamant about not doing any indemnity for TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5451)|
| 1:30:58| It's been really great to have the back of the law director behind us on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5458)|
| 1:31:04| because they have essentially given in on that issue on every single point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5464)|
| 1:31:09| And today our meeting, as we went over the insurance provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5469)|
| 1:31:12| where they agreed to buy their own insurance and therefore they're not going to look to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| They were worried for a long time about slips and falls in the building, and so I think that's going to be a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5477)|
| 1:31:23| I know there's some issues about custody and control that the law director is concerned about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5483)|
| 1:31:29| I think those issues really don't go to the validity of the contract the more I thought about it after talking with him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5489)|
| 1:31:35| because they go to whether the school board, the Board of Education, can move into the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5495)|
| 1:31:41| whether they legally are giving up too much of their right to control the building if they move in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5501)|
| 1:31:46| I think that's an issue that we've got to continue to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| We need to either seek advice from the state, the attorney general's office maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5510)|
| 1:31:55| We also could address it statutorily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| I agree it's a valid issue that we need to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| In the worst-case scenario, this office space, I think the mayor would tell you, is so cost-efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5520)|
| 1:32:06| that he could use the space wisely and that we could use the question of custody and control| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5526)|
| 1:32:13| could be avoided by using the office space for other uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| As you all know, UT has already taken it to the State Building Commission that they would like the upper six floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5536)|
| 1:32:22| I've talked to their general counsel several times, and they have been adamant to me that they're just very anxious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5542)|
| 1:32:28| to get to work and to finalize our subagreement with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| but we've held that off until we know whether we have an agreement with TVA in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5552)|
| 1:32:37| And so I know they seem very positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| I know that was a really long answer to a short question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| but those are the sort of things that have been keeping me up at night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5561)|
| 1:32:44| and I know they've been keeping the law department up at night as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| No, those were very good answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5567)|
| 1:32:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5569)|
| 1:32:50| Mark, stick around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| I've got, because you said this, the question of custody and control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| Could you eliminate a little bit more about that particular area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5575)|
| 1:33:01| kind of in layman's terms kind of what that means and kind of how that concern, where we are in solving it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5581)|
| 1:33:09| Well, the great part about being a lawyer is that two lawyers can be right about the same issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5589)|
| 1:33:13| because there's always, the law is just never clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| There's very little case law interpreting custody and control, whether it only applies to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5597)|
| 1:33:22| I mean, I think the concept generally is that they couldn't tell, sorry, no disrespect to you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5602)|
| 1:33:28| but you guys couldn't tell South Boyle High School to relocate something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| You all do not have a right to control where schools are going to be located and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| That was, I think, the general background behind custody and control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| Whether it applies to administrative offices, to me, is a very gray area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5620)|
| 1:33:44| I know something, again, Bud and I talked about it, and I think he's done a lot of good research,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5624)|
| 1:33:48| and he and I haven't had a chance to sit down and talk about it since I caught back from vacation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| so I'd like the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5632)|
| 1:33:54| But I think that's a, and so the question is, is really, is it legal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5634)|
| 1:34:03| is it legal to put the Board of Education's administrative offices in a facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5643)|
| 1:34:07| that has to live up to federal security standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5647)|
| 1:34:10| Federal security standards are tighter a little bit than PBA security standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5650)|
| 1:34:15| and so, and therefore, if a school employee is found to be a security threat to TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5655)|
| 1:34:23| they could be asked not to work in that building by TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| I know that's been a big issue that we've negotiated to death,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| but TVA feels adamant because they have some very important IT functions underneath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5669)|
| 1:34:34| what would be the Board of Education building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5674)|
| 1:34:36| so they really feel strongly that they can't have anyone that's a security risk in that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5676)|
| 1:34:40| And so that is sort of the core question to me, is are these relatively high security levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5680)|
| 1:34:49| which I think most of us would agree is a good thing for our school personnel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| as it provides them a lot of protection, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| because certainly there's a lot of emotional issues relative to schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| that by having a high degree of security, that's a good thing for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| But it also does not allow as much free movement of folks in and out of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5704)|
| 1:35:11| It also does not allow as many public meetings to be held there as easily as you might otherwise have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| So they certainly are giving up something in terms of freedom of use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5716)|
| 1:35:19| that is a tradeoff for a higher security level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| And so that really is the core issue on whether there's a custody and control problem here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5722)|
| 1:35:27| and it's something that there's just really very little in my judgment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5727)|
| 1:35:33| Again, certainly the law department can disagree with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5733)|
| 1:35:40| There's just not a whole lot of case law or opinions from the Attorney General out there on this particular issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5740)|
| 1:35:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5748)|
| 1:35:49| The Chair will recognize Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5749)|
| 1:35:52| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5752)|
| 1:35:53| Mr. Caldewell, following up on Commissioner Gill's question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5753)|
| 1:35:58| for some time now there's been questions about access, questions about ADA compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5758)|
| 1:36:03| questions about security questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| There's been at least half a dozen topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| And I guess my general question is have all those been worked through over the period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5769)|
| 1:36:14| when this conversation really got dug in here on commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5774)|
| 1:36:17| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5777)|
| 1:36:18| So you mentioned ADA and then you mentioned security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| Let's talk about ADA first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5781)|
| 1:36:24| We're addressing ADA first by building an ADA entrance in the Fritz lot, which you would enter from Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5784)|
| 1:36:36| And so that would be our ADA entrance with parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| So that solves that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5799)|
| 1:36:41| Later on in the next, I don't want to put them in a time crunch, but 12 to 24 months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5801)|
| 1:36:46| TVA has plans to change the plaza area, which would make it more ADA friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5806)|
| 1:36:53| So that will help in that area as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| As it relates to security, there's been a lot of questions about real ID and about October 1st, 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5815)|
| 1:37:04| will you have to have a real ID to enter the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5824)|
| 1:37:10| We got a ruling from TVA Police that if you do not have adequate ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5830)|
| 1:37:19| that you can still visit the plaza level area, which TVA will manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5839)|
| 1:37:28| And we will come down as far as to have those meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| The plan the whole time as we design the building, and Mike Dooley may speak to this more than me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5852)|
| 1:37:38| but our design the whole time was to have a lot of office space on the plaza level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5858)|
| 1:37:44| so we come down and meet the public, not having the public go up in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| And so having a designated area for any individual who may not have the appropriate ID has been addressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5869)|
| 1:37:59| and they will be allowed to meet with school officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| So is it fair to say that you've addressed virtually all the big issues that have been raised by commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5884)|
| 1:38:11| and school board members the last three months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| Yeah, I think as far as we've heard the most about real ID, right, and so that's been addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5894)|
| 1:38:20| And so, you know, any deal we could bring would have issues, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5900)|
| 1:38:28| There's no perfect deal, and so you could probably pinpoint some things that you don't like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5908)|
| 1:38:34| but ultimately as a whole, if you go to the AJ building today to see a school official,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5914)|
| 1:38:41| you've got to show a driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| If you come in this building today, you don't have to show a driver's license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| but you've got to go through metal detectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5926)|
| 1:38:49| We're kind of combining those two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5931)|
| 1:38:53| All right, thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| Back to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5935)|
| 1:38:56| I believe I'm back to Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5936)|
| 1:38:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| This question is for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| Earlier tonight, I think it was agenda item number 30,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5944)|
| 1:39:08| with the engineering and public works on easements of 12 parcels on Shod Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5948)|
| 1:39:15| and the federal agency, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, wasn't happy with an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5955)|
| 1:39:21| They wanted us to purchase the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| So how is this that the easement works for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5964)|
| 1:39:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5974)|
| 1:39:38| We have a very complex issue here with several prongs to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5978)|
| 1:39:45| The mayor asked me for a written opinion of where the law director's office stood on these documents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5985)|
| 1:39:51| so we gave him in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| And the major issues that we dealt with, and my dear friend and a person I truly respect,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=5994)|
| 1:40:07| we may have differing opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6007)|
| 1:40:10| But the truth is that the major issue is on one of the major issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| Back a year ago, we met with TVA and the conference room for the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6014)|
| 1:40:20| We gave them the three issues that we still have before us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| Fortunately, Mark has worked out one of them, which was indemnification,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| and they finally decided we're not going to indemnify them, and I really truly, Mark, I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6028)|
| 1:40:35| The other one still deals with the easement, and the question that I asked was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| give me something, a written authority, whereby you can use an easement in place of the federal lease law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6039)|
| 1:40:45| And because easements are fluid, just like we heard tonight, I didn't pay much attention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6045)|
| 1:40:51| but the Corps of Engineers rules have changed on easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6051)|
| 1:40:55| We have a contract, but things can affect easements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6055)|
| 1:40:58| All that does is give us the right to use the underlying land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| and they're tying a huge contract of real property on top of an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6062)|
| 1:41:08| The federal law allows for a lease to be done, which, however, if you go through the lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6068)|
| 1:41:15| the only consideration under a lease that TVA can take is money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6075)|
| 1:41:20| So all of these custody and control issues and all that kind of stuff would be not enforceable under a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6080)|
| 1:41:27| But they want to use the easement, and so I asked, and I think Mark is trying to get me something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6087)|
| 1:41:36| whereby we can have a written authority that an easement is legally available to be used in this circumstance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6096)|
| 1:41:45| versus the federal lease statute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6105)|
| 1:41:49| The second thing, we have the two with indemnification where, at one time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6109)|
| 1:41:54| they were wanting us to waive our immunity, throw away all of our limits of liability, and then still insure them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6114)|
| 1:42:02| But it seems like I'll know tomorrow I'm still not happy with what we have before you tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6122)|
| 1:42:09| because there's too many things not addressing what we've talked about tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6129)|
| 1:42:13| We'll see what we have by next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6133)|
| 1:42:17| The other one is it's not really an issue at all, it seems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6137)|
| 1:42:22| I think case law is pretty clear, and Mark and I can disagree on this or whoever wants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6142)|
| 1:42:27| The Supreme Court has ruled that the legislative body here has the power to appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6147)|
| 1:42:33| but they do not have the power to pick sites of any school facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6153)|
| 1:42:39| They do not have the power to dictate to the school board where they go or cannot go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6159)|
| 1:42:43| and they do not have the power to take school property away from the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6163)|
| 1:42:50| And the Supreme Court's been clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6170)|
| 1:42:52| The only authority this board has as it relates to public education is to appropriate or not appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6172)|
| 1:42:59| The school board entered in good faith into an MOU, which the bodies approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6179)|
| 1:43:05| and gave direction to the administration to bring forth several sites where the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6185)|
| 1:43:14| and under statute, the director of school has the authority to pick school sites| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6194)|
| 1:43:19| and recommend to the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| And in this negotiation process, which this body had approved under an MOU back in July 2015,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6201)|
| 1:43:28| and I explained this to the administration in the request of our writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| that was the fourth issue that I had that we were not in compliance with what we had agreed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6213)|
| 1:43:40| Now we find ourselves with the documents that are incomplete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6220)|
| 1:43:45| and I would always say to this body do not approve a contract when there's blank documents in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6225)|
| 1:43:51| I don't care if it's the greatest thing since sliced bread,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6231)|
| 1:43:55| and I do not challenge the mayor's evaluation of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6235)|
| 1:43:59| but I do challenge the idea I can't give you legal advice to say approve things that are not finalized in any form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6239)|
| 1:44:09| because we don't have a deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| A contract under law is a meeting of the minds between parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6251)|
| 1:44:16| Well, it's hard to meet a mind when you've got 26 elements within these 42 documents that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6256)|
| 1:44:24| whereby in the end TVA will audit and tell you where you have what you owe and what you don't owe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6264)|
| 1:44:31| There are other legal concerns that I would advise to be cautious about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6271)|
| 1:44:36| whereby you're taking on for a dollar a bunch of equipment and chattels, for lack of a better word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6276)|
| 1:44:46| in the Summer Place building if you want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| But if you don't want them, then we've got to pay to get rid of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6290)|
| 1:44:53| Well, I think we should look at them first before we commit to pay to get rid of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| If we don't want them, TVA should have the burden to get rid of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| I guess what I'm looking at in these things is not whether we have a good deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6301)|
| 1:45:05| or whether we don't have a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| Everything in these contracts so far are strongly tilted toward the Tennessee Valley Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6308)|
| 1:45:19| And I love TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6319)|
| 1:45:21| They've been very good to me, and I'm not against TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6321)|
| 1:45:24| But I think we need to look at the taxpayers and what we're exposing ourselves to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6324)|
| 1:45:29| And when you vote on these contracts, make sure the contracts are final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| Make sure they're in their final.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6333)|
| 1:45:34| I heard for the first time that we may have some things worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6334)|
| 1:45:39| We're meeting tomorrow, Mark, at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6339)|
| 1:45:42| Next Monday may be a different thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6342)|
| 1:45:44| But tonight, what's before you is incomplete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6344)|
| 1:45:49| What's before you has too many unanswered questions for me to say it's in legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6349)|
| 1:45:54| And that's where I sat tonight on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6354)|
| 1:45:57| That's where I've sat on this issue for over a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6357)|
| 1:46:00| And we have gone straightforward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| We haven't been in compliance with our MOU with the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6363)|
| 1:46:07| We're basically dictating to them or enticing them to do what we want them to do without fair play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6367)|
| 1:46:15| And so we could be in breach of an agreement with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6375)|
| 1:46:19| That could poison anything we do going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6379)|
| 1:46:22| That's the legal advice that I am giving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6382)|
| 1:46:25| It does not preclude you from doing anything that you decide to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6385)|
| 1:46:31| But this body doesn't have the authority to dictate directly or indirectly to the schools where they're going to have a school facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6391)|
| 1:46:41| They have management control over schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| This body can only appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6404)|
| 1:46:47| Contractually, I would not recommend this body approve anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6407)|
| 1:46:52| And you all never have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6412)|
| 1:46:53| The quote has blanks in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6413)|
| 1:46:55| You always say, well, let's fill in the blanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6415)|
| 1:46:57| All I'm saying tonight is you better fill in the blanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6417)|
| 1:47:01| So that's where the law director stands on these issues tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6421)|
| 1:47:06| And custody and control, I'll give you some examples of concern of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6426)|
| 1:47:13| The school board could hire TVA security if they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6433)|
| 1:47:17| But they would have the management and control over TVA security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6437)|
| 1:47:21| The school board can hire PBA to be their security if they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6441)|
| 1:47:24| They still have management and control over the policies related to what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6444)|
| 1:47:29| The school board could use their own officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6449)|
| 1:47:32| Under this current agreement, my sheriff's patrolmen can't go in that building with their firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6452)|
| 1:47:38| Yeah, they can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6458)|
| 1:47:39| Unless it is an emergency related to a police operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| If, for example, one of our employees is on a no-fly list, and Mark mentioned that, it could be the wrong name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6463)|
| 1:47:52| But TVA is going to be able to dictate who can work in that building and not work in that building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6472)|
| 1:47:57| based upon their security elements that some of them, they cannot even disclose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6477)|
| 1:48:03| So we would be constrained by things we don't even know, and our employees would be vulnerable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6483)|
| 1:48:09| So the custody and control is not just to the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6489)|
| 1:48:13| The custody and control is the power of the school board to manage and to take care of their personnel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6493)|
| 1:48:20| and to make decisions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6500)|
| 1:48:22| If we have a tenured school teacher that runs sideways, there's statutory procedures for us to go through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6502)|
| 1:48:28| And then we're going to come, and we may not be able to tell them why we had to let them go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6508)|
| 1:48:32| There's just some real issues related to personnel, custody and control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6512)|
| 1:48:38| and the power of the school board to give up some of their managerial and operational rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6518)|
| 1:48:43| to the federal government to rent space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6523)|
| 1:48:46| And I have mentioned that from the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6526)|
| 1:48:50| I mentioned that a year ago to TVA, and TVA assured me in that commission room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6530)|
| 1:48:56| no problem, Law Director, we can work this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6536)|
| 1:48:59| And we're right now on the eve of contracts that are incomplete being asked for this body to vote on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6539)|
| 1:49:07| and we still don't have the custody and control issue resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6547)|
| 1:49:11| And I don't believe TVA is going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6551)|
| 1:49:14| Now, if you want to do this for the county and for the mayor, and the mayor has some other use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6554)|
| 1:49:22| and you go to Plan B for schools or whatever, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6562)|
| 1:49:26| All those are policy decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6566)|
| 1:49:28| But I'm not sure that we'll have legal form unless the school board has custody control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6568)|
| 1:49:34| Mark and I have talked about an attorney general opinion, but we can't get that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6574)|
| 1:49:39| And we have case law that has said what I just told you, your role as it relates to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6579)|
| 1:49:46| So those are the legal issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6586)|
| 1:49:50| Policy issue is if you want that building, you can take that building, you can rent that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6590)|
| 1:49:56| you can do whatever you want to with that building, but schools is a different question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6596)|
| 1:50:01| You have another item coming up to sell the A.J. building, and schools has not relinquished control of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6601)|
| 1:50:09| And you say, well, for example, that is controlled by Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| We have the deed to it, or TVA has the deed to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6613)|
| 1:50:16| Well, Knox County has the deed to a lot of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6616)|
| 1:50:19| But the school system has custody and control of those buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6619)|
| 1:50:23| We've been wanting to, quote, get rule off going down the hill slope for many years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6623)|
| 1:50:29| but we have to wait for the schools to surplus it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| It's title to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6633)|
| 1:50:35| It's not a matter of title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6635)|
| 1:50:36| It's a matter of statutory power over the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6636)|
| 1:50:39| And the director of school has that power over all facilities, and this body has no power over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6639)|
| 1:50:46| And that is the legal advice in these matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6646)|
| 1:50:50| It doesn't preclude, and I told the mayor that, him leasing the TVA towers for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6650)|
| 1:50:57| If it's that good a deal, then we can do something with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6657)|
| 1:51:01| But I have a real issue at this point in time of being out of compliance with our MOU and custody and control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6661)|
| 1:51:09| and I'm still waiting on the authority by the Tennessee Valley Authority to use an easement instead of a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6669)|
| 1:51:15| Those are my major legal concerns that keep this contract and all subordinate contracts out of legal form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6675)|
| 1:51:25| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6685)|
| 1:51:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6686)|
| 1:51:27| Back to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6689)|
| 1:51:33| A question on the MOU with the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6693)|
| 1:51:37| Have not all the terms of that MOU been met, the two schools built, the raises to the teachers and everything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6697)|
| 1:51:42| but the final, when they signed that, didn't they agree to leave the A.J. building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6702)|
| 1:51:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6708)|
| 1:51:49| They did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6709)|
| 1:51:52| What that MOU said is that purchasing would evaluate some sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6712)|
| 1:51:57| and those sites would be presented to the school for their consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6717)|
| 1:52:01| Sites, not one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6721)|
| 1:52:04| Those sites would be evaluated for what's in the best interest of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6724)|
| 1:52:08| Then they would work together with the county to select one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6728)|
| 1:52:11| That site then would be selected, and at that time, they would consider releasing custody and control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6731)|
| 1:52:18| depending on what the conditions were and how long it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6738)|
| 1:52:21| and what it would take to get it done and a lot of variables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6741)|
| 1:52:24| At the original thing, it's funny that we were talking about consolidation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6744)|
| 1:52:29| One of the things was it was an opportunity to consolidate some of the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6749)|
| 1:52:33| They talked about rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6753)|
| 1:52:35| They talked about different locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| and the purchasing people and the land people were to evaluate this and give it to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6758)|
| 1:52:45| That's what we agreed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6765)|
| 1:52:46| That's what this body directed the administration to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6766)|
| 1:52:50| So far, the only thing that's come through our office for contract development is the Tennessee Valley Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6770)|
| 1:52:57| I don't know that we're in compliance with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6777)|
| 1:53:01| I know we're not in compliance with it at this moment today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6781)|
| 1:53:08| Under the security agreement, you had said that sheriff's deputies couldn't enter the building with a gun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6788)|
| 1:53:14| Under the federal building, it's just like going across the street to the federal courts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6794)|
| 1:53:19| You have to leave everything in a locker when you enter that first floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6799)|
| 1:53:25| Also, we're talking about a third-party agreement with the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6805)|
| 1:53:32| The University of Tennessee has the same issues to work out with TVA that I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6812)|
| 1:53:38| Are they going to waive their statutory responsibilities, or can they, to have UT be their security people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6818)|
| 1:53:47| The statutes allow the school system to have the SROs to use their sheriff to lease and hire outside personnel to do these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6827)|
| 1:53:59| All the power of the school systems have been circumvented through this agreement, or potential thereof, of custody and control by our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6839)|
| 1:54:10| As Knox County Law Director, I'm going to make somebody mad all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6850)|
| 1:54:15| On different occasions, I've made the schools mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6855)|
| 1:54:17| On other occasions, I've made the administration mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6857)|
| 1:54:20| On some occasions, I've made this board mad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| But my responsibility is to the taxpayers and this government, and I have to protect the school system, sometimes even from themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6863)|
| 1:54:31| They have a statutory responsibility and powers under the statute they cannot waive, no matter how big the lollipop looks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6871)|
| 1:54:39| So we need to negotiate these things in such a way to protect my school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6879)|
| 1:54:45| And this body cannot dictate that to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6885)|
| 1:54:49| They are in control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6889)|
| 1:54:50| They are the elected body to manage and operate and control the state's schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6890)|
| 1:55:00| And that's where we find ourselves in this whole issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| And I'm not against TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6902)|
| 1:55:04| Like I said, dead blame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6904)|
| 1:55:06| TVA is almost like a family to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6906)|
| 1:55:10| But I also know TVA, when I worked for them, I looked out for what's in their best interest, and that's what they're supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6910)|
| 1:55:18| And so over here, unfortunately to my colleagues across them all, now I work for Knox County, and I have to look out for what's in your best interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6918)|
| 1:55:27| And under these agreements and where we are, I have to look out for my school system's best interest, and I have to advise this body what their limitations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6927)|
| 1:55:36| And I have to say right now, we don't have anything that's viable to vote on before this board because there's too many blanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6936)|
| 1:55:43| That's the legal element.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6943)|
| 1:55:44| That's the legal requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6944)|
| 1:55:46| That's the legal problems that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6946)|
| 1:55:48| And I'll be glad to address anything any more specific, but the county can do things differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6948)|
| 1:55:56| I'm sorry, John, you had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6956)|
| 1:55:59| Can I just get a clarification of what he said about the MOU?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6959)|
| 1:56:02| A clarification of what the law director said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6962)|
| 1:56:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6964)|
| 1:56:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6965)|
| 1:56:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6966)|
| 1:56:07| In other words, that was dated in July of 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6967)|
| 1:56:11| Is that your best?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6971)|
| 1:56:12| Yeah, I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6972)|
| 1:56:13| July 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6973)|
| 1:56:14| Commissioner Anders, Commissioner Busler, Commissioner Smith, and myself voted for that MOU then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6974)|
| 1:56:21| I presume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6981)|
| 1:56:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6982)|
| 1:56:23| It was July 6, 2015, between Knox County Board and the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6983)|
| 1:56:28| And the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6988)|
| 1:56:29| Yeah, Knox County's commission and school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6989)|
| 1:56:32| And the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6992)|
| 1:56:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6993)|
| 1:56:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6994)|
| 1:56:35| So that was what we were asked, and that's what they were asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6995)|
| 1:56:38| And agreements mean things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=6998)|
| 1:56:41| And the schools, over all this process, I've had calls from them and said, we haven't heard anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7001)|
| 1:56:47| This is long before today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| And I said, well, you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| But I don't know about the you will now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7011)|
| 1:56:53| You will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7013)|
| 1:56:54| And you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7014)|
| 1:56:55| And I don't see the compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7015)|
| 1:56:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7018)|
| 1:56:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7019)|
| 1:57:00| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7020)|
| 1:57:01| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7021)|
| 1:57:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7022)|
| 1:57:04| Question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7024)|
| 1:57:06| Question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7026)|
| 1:57:08| In the MOU that is in this packet of information that's going before the school board for a vote on Wednesday of this week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7028)|
| 1:57:17| it clearly says here that Knox County Board of Education agrees to relocate central office from the Andrew Johnson building to the TVA East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7037)|
| 1:57:27| So in this agreement, is it not clearly set forth that the Board of Education is making a collective decision to an agreement to relocate the offices?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7047)|
| 1:57:38| Isn't that their intent to release that command and control?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7058)|
| 1:57:41| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7061)|
| 1:57:43| It says in that thing that if we vote on that, we're willing to move to the TVA Towers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7063)|
| 1:57:49| The legal question is, even under that MOU, is it in legal form, do they have the authority to waive their custody and control under state statute?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7069)|
| 1:57:58| I don't believe they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| Hold that thought for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7080)|
| 1:58:01| So you're saying you're questioning whether they have the ability to move an office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7081)|
| 1:58:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7085)|
| 1:58:07| I didn't say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7087)|
| 1:58:09| They can move anywhere they want to as long as they're not in violation of state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7089)|
| 1:58:13| The question is, and that's what Mark and I have been talking about, to get an opinion to see if they can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7093)|
| 1:58:21| because I hate for them to do something that turns out to be improper and it results in ultra vires and we're investing a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7101)|
| 1:58:31| But the mayor has looked at this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7111)|
| 1:58:34| He thinks it's a good idea for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7114)|
| 1:58:37| Am I speaking correctly for you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7117)|
| 1:58:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7119)|
| 1:58:40| I don't want to speak out of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| I'm not against whatever you're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7122)|
| 1:58:44| The question is whether the school board can move there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7124)|
| 1:58:47| And that's the legal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7127)|
| 1:58:49| So they can move, in your opinion, they can decide to move anywhere, but the question is can they move there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7129)|
| 1:58:54| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| But in this agreement that they're voting on, it says we agree to relocate there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7136)|
| 1:59:03| They're making a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7143)|
| 1:59:05| They're going to decide whether they're going to vote on that or not, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7145)|
| 1:59:08| If they vote yes, they are clearly in this writing making a decision to say we, the school board, agree to move from here to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7148)|
| 1:59:16| You can have a resolution on this board to clearly demand that they move there, and you can vote on it, and you can pass it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7156)|
| 1:59:23| No, no, but that's not us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7163)|
| 1:59:24| I'm not talking about us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7164)|
| 1:59:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7165)|
| 1:59:26| They are in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7166)|
| 1:59:27| It's a matter of legality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7167)|
| 1:59:29| The question is can they legally move there, even if they vote to move there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7169)|
| 1:59:35| The question is can you legally require them to move?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7175)|
| 1:59:39| This agreement doesn't say that we are requiring them to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| It is saying we agree to move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7183)|
| 1:59:46| The question is do they have the authority to make that agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| That's the legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7190)|
| 1:59:52| That's what Mark Mamentoff and I have been trying to work on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7192)|
| 1:59:56| Can they waive their custody and control of a school facility and move?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7196)|
| 2:00:03| They can vote to move if they want to vote to move, but is it legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7203)|
| 2:00:08| There's a difference in having a legislative action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7208)|
| 2:00:11| Matter of fact, we just had an action today that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals says that the entire billboard statute of the state of Tennessee is unconstitutional, and it went away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7211)|
| 2:00:22| So the question is will this go away if it's illegal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7222)|
| 2:00:27| I don't want us to get started down a path, spend a lot of money, get some bonding from Mark, and come to find out the school board can't go there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7227)|
| 2:00:34| We've started to pay for a move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7234)|
| 2:00:35| We've got to move somewhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7235)|
| 2:00:36| Now we don't have anywhere for them to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7236)|
| 2:00:39| I have to at least raise the issues for the consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7239)|
| 2:00:51| Mr. J., you're good for now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7251)|
| 2:00:53| No, but I'll relinquish the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7253)|
| 2:00:56| It's more confusing than it started with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7256)|
| 2:00:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7258)|
| 2:00:59| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7259)|
| 2:01:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7262)|
| 2:01:06| I'm understanding your statement, but I'm on the lease agreement for occupancy by and between Knox County and TVA Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7266)|
| 2:01:15| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7275)|
| 2:01:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7276)|
| 2:01:17| So I just need to make sure I'm there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7277)|
| 2:01:22| So even with an incomplete contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7286)|
| 2:01:27| Because this permanent easement versus this lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7287)|
| 2:01:31| I'm fully understanding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7291)|
| 2:01:35| We don't have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7295)|
| 2:01:42| There is outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7302)|
| 2:01:49| There are some blanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7309)|
| 2:01:51| Will those blanks be filled in time for Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7311)|
| 2:01:55| Because part of under the agenda under number 21 on the resolution page, the school board hadn't voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7315)|
| 2:02:07| We are about to take a vote or move this with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7327)|
| 2:02:12| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7332)|
| 2:02:13| Yet we have outstanding concerns and documents that are missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7333)|
| 2:02:19| So what is the process to answer the questions that are blank?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7339)|
| 2:02:25| Hopefully Mark and I and Charlie Sturkey can fill in a lot of these blanks tomorrow at 2 o'clock in the afternoon with TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7345)|
| 2:02:34| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7354)|
| 2:02:35| I said at this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7357)|
| 2:02:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7358)|
| 2:02:39| We have blanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7359)|
| 2:02:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7360)|
| 2:02:41| And I can't recommend voting on something with blanks regardless of what the contract is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7361)|
| 2:02:44| We don't have a meeting of the minds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7364)|
| 2:02:46| The motion on the floor is to vote without approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7366)|
| 2:02:48| Sent forward with no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7368)|
| 2:02:49| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7369)|
| 2:02:50| I'm just telling you where the law director is on three issues plus an MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7370)|
| 2:02:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7374)|
| 2:02:55| And I'm telling you the same thing I told the mayor back in October and the same thing I told TVA a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7375)|
| 2:03:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7380)|
| 2:03:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7381)|
| 2:03:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7382)|
| 2:03:03| I just needed just to make sure we're on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7383)|
| 2:03:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7384)|
| 2:03:05| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7385)|
| 2:03:06| Thank you, Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7386)|
| 2:03:07| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| You were talking about the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7390)|
| 2:03:12| I've got a question about the legality of the MOU that they agreed upon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7392)|
| 2:03:16| Superintendent Thomas, can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7396)|
| 2:03:20| Do we have a copy of the MOU?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| That's what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7402)|
| 2:03:27| That's what you said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7407)|
| 2:03:31| It's been a little while since I voted on that MOU for the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7411)|
| 2:03:35| but I do believe we directed the purchasing department to give you a list of 12, at least 12,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7415)|
| 2:03:43| viable pieces of property to vote on, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7423)|
| 2:03:48| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7428)|
| 2:03:49| Did you receive this copy of 12 to choose from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7429)|
| 2:03:54| I did receive a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7434)|
| 2:03:56| It's probably the same copy that you've got there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7436)|
| 2:03:58| It's been a little while back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7438)|
| 2:03:59| I know Mr. Caldwell was at the board workshop the other night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7439)|
| 2:04:02| and went over some of the places or locations that were looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7442)|
| 2:04:08| and did explain to the board why those were limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7448)|
| 2:04:12| When did you see this copy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7452)|
| 2:04:14| Years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| No, it's been several weeks ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7455)|
| 2:04:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7459)|
| 2:04:21| Can I speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7461)|
| 2:04:22| Is Matt Myers here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7462)|
| 2:04:23| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7463)|
| 2:04:24| Can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7464)|
| 2:04:46| Thank you, Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7486)|
| 2:04:47| It looked like you were going to sleep back there, and I thought I'd wake you up just to ask you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7487)|
| 2:04:51| Not to not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7491)|
| 2:04:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| This list that I've got in my hands, were you part of making it up at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7494)|
| 2:05:00| Were you in charge of purchasing at that time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7500)|
| 2:05:03| In 15?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7505)|
| 2:05:07| Not in 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7507)|
| 2:05:08| I was not in charge of purchasing, no, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7508)|
| 2:05:11| Well, who would have made this list up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7511)|
| 2:05:15| I'm not going to speak for somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7515)|
| 2:05:20| I have not seen the list, so I'm assuming it came from the finance department, which is who I work for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7520)|
| 2:05:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7525)|
| 2:05:27| But it was supposed to come from the purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| Would you have a copy of it anywhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7529)|
| 2:05:32| No, sir, I do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7532)|
| 2:05:35| So, Mr. Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7535)|
| 2:05:37| Purchasing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7537)|
| 2:05:38| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7538)|
| 2:05:39| Fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7539)|
| 2:05:40| But it was directed on the MOU for the purchasing to look at these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7540)|
| 2:05:43| Mr. Caldwell, did you receive this list that you sent me from the purchasing department?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7543)|
| 2:05:52| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7552)|
| 2:05:53| No, it's, did you receive this from the purchasing department as directed by this body to look?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7553)|
| 2:06:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7561)|
| 2:06:02| Procurement works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7562)|
| 2:06:04| That's how that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7564)|
| 2:06:05| And so they were involved in the process as we looked at sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7565)|
| 2:06:10| So we consulted with Public Building Authority, Barbara McMurray Architects, and Partners Development and Procurement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7570)|
| 2:06:19| and looked at those sites that's in your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7579)|
| 2:06:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7582)|
| 2:06:23| Was this the same list that you got?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7583)|
| 2:06:26| I don't know what list it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7586)|
| 2:06:27| That's the list of the sites that were available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7587)|
| 2:06:31| You had a different list the last time, Mr. J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7591)|
| 2:06:33| I don't know where this list came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7593)|
| 2:06:35| It came from Chris Caldwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7595)|
| 2:06:37| It wasn't distributed to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7600)|
| 2:06:41| Let me ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7601)|
| 2:06:42| Thank you, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7602)|
| 2:06:43| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7603)|
| 2:06:44| Mr. Law Director, on our MOU, didn't we direct where this was supposed to be come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7604)|
| 2:06:55| From a procedural standpoint, they can do it however they want to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7615)|
| 2:06:59| The direction was that the purchasing or the procurement would present some sites, not 12 or otherwise, to the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7619)|
| 2:07:11| to the schools, to the director of schools for their consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7631)|
| 2:07:14| They would evaluate those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7634)|
| 2:07:16| And then jointly, the schools and Knox County would select an appropriate site for the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7636)|
| 2:07:28| And up until just, I have never been told otherwise that that has ever happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7648)|
| 2:07:33| I know that the schools have been informed of sites that the county has selected and eliminated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7653)|
| 2:07:41| and that they have given them the option for one site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7661)|
| 2:07:45| And that site's the one we've been working with for a contract now since forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7665)|
| 2:07:52| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7672)|
| 2:07:55| Superintendent Thomas, could I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7675)|
| 2:07:58| You said you saw this list, what, two or three weeks ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7678)|
| 2:08:02| It's been several weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7682)|
| 2:08:03| Several weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7683)|
| 2:08:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7684)|
| 2:08:05| So we've been working on this for two or three years, and this is the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7685)|
| 2:08:08| Has your board seen this list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7688)|
| 2:08:10| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7690)|
| 2:08:11| I don't know if that was sent to the board or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7691)|
| 2:08:14| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7694)|
| 2:08:16| Maybe Chris could answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7696)|
| 2:08:18| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7698)|
| 2:08:19| And the only reason why I am is we've got an MOU that we sent out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7699)|
| 2:08:26| and if you haven't seen it or the board hadn't seen it, could we be in violation of that MOU, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7706)|
| 2:08:37| Well, procedurally, the board has not acted on any recommendations from the superintendent to the board about selecting a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7717)|
| 2:08:47| The only thing that has come to the best of my knowledge, and the director of schools standing here before me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7727)|
| 2:08:53| that he has received one site that is acceptable by Knox County, and that they offered that site to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7733)|
| 2:09:00| And if that's true and they haven't received other sites that the school board could select from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7740)|
| 2:09:07| then we're not in compliance with the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7747)|
| 2:09:10| And each of the other sites should have the same amount of information and due diligence to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7750)|
| 2:09:15| where the school board could look and say, well, here's the advantages of TVA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7755)|
| 2:09:20| and here's the advantage of a second site and here's the advantage of a third site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7760)|
| 2:09:25| and let's look at it in the best interest of the school board and what's in our best interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7765)|
| 2:09:30| and the director of schools' job is to evaluate that and then bring it before the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7770)|
| 2:09:35| The school board would then say, yes, let's go and negotiate and see what we can do to get one of these sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7775)|
| 2:09:42| I don't think that has ever been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7782)|
| 2:09:44| I've not been informed of that and I've not worked on any other instruments other than the TVA site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7784)|
| 2:09:50| So my question is, I'm not sure that we're in compliance with the MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7790)|
| 2:09:54| I'm not taking this to trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7794)|
| 2:09:56| I'm just making sure that my school board is being treated fairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7796)|
| 2:10:01| and that they are good with what's going on with the MOU| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7801)|
| 2:10:05| and that this body is not dictating to them where they're going to put a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7805)|
| 2:10:11| either directly or indirectly, by incentive because if they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7811)|
| 2:10:16| that puts in question whether this MOU is being validly implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7816)|
| 2:10:23| That's all I'm saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7823)|
| 2:10:24| That was a legal concern I had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7824)|
| 2:10:26| The other one dealt with easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7826)|
| 2:10:28| The other one dealt with custody and control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7828)|
| 2:10:30| The other one dealt with immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7830)|
| 2:10:32| Those four I communicated to the mayor in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7832)|
| 2:10:37| Mark and I have been working on all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7837)|
| 2:10:40| I haven't talked to the superintendent of schools or the director of schools about the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7840)|
| 2:10:46| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7846)|
| 2:10:47| Another question, Mr. Law Director, since I can make you mad, let me get this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7847)|
| 2:10:53| So if it was not followed properly, this MOU,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7853)|
| 2:10:58| and we get up to the final thing to sign the last little piece of paper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7858)|
| 2:11:02| can the school systems back out of it that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7862)|
| 2:11:06| The school systems can select any site they want to or stay in the A.J. building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7866)|
| 2:11:12| They agreed to look at relinquishing the A.J. building subject to several sites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7872)|
| 2:11:19| That's what they agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7879)|
| 2:11:22| And I don't know whether we on this side, Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7882)|
| 2:11:25| has complied with what they agreed to on that side, the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7885)|
| 2:11:30| They don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7890)|
| 2:11:32| The school board can do whatever it wants to in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7892)|
| 2:11:35| But the question now is if the school board votes to go to the TVA tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7895)|
| 2:11:41| do they have the power and authority to do that and waive their custody and control of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7901)|
| 2:11:47| and put someone else in charge of potentially their personnel, their security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7907)|
| 2:11:53| and the use of that facility that is statutorily given to the director of schools?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7913)|
| 2:11:59| That's a real legal concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7919)|
| 2:12:02| My job is to bring forth the legal concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7922)|
| 2:12:05| My job is not to tell this body or the school board what to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7925)|
| 2:12:09| But I have a legal obligation to the school board and to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7929)|
| 2:12:14| and the taxpayers of Knox County to express my concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7934)|
| 2:12:18| Mark, I believe, has worked out one of my biggest ones, which was immunity and indemnification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7938)|
| 2:12:25| We'll talk about all this tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7945)|
| 2:12:27| But the school board, if they want to vote on a new amendment to this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7947)|
| 2:12:33| we can work all this stuff out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7953)|
| 2:12:35| But I'm just saying where we sit right now today, I'm not sure we're in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7955)|
| 2:12:40| It doesn't mean we can't get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7960)|
| 2:12:42| It just said there's a lot more to this than contracts that are before this board that are incomplete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7962)|
| 2:12:49| and I don't know whether they'll be complete by Monday or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7969)|
| 2:12:52| So I'm just saying be cautious with what you do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7972)|
| 2:12:55| because we're going to have to defend whatever it is you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7975)|
| 2:12:59| And personally, I don't have a dog in the fight as to what you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7979)|
| 2:13:02| but I have to bring these issues before you when you make a decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7982)|
| 2:13:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7987)|
| 2:13:08| And there was Mark had made a statement about something about the attorney general making a ruling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7988)|
| 2:13:15| Is that correct, Mr. Manitow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=7995)|
| 2:13:24| You had mentioned it earlier, and I just kind of—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8004)|
| 2:13:27| To be very clear, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8007)|
| 2:13:28| I mean, as the law director and I discussed, and, again, we agree on 99% of the stuff we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8008)|
| 2:13:34| What he and I discussed was this is a state legal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8014)|
| 2:13:37| One alternative to get a resolution of it is to ask the attorney general for opinion addressing the issue specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8017)|
| 2:13:43| And he's out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8023)|
| 2:13:46| I mean, as you all know, the attorney general is from here, from Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8026)|
| 2:13:49| I'd like to get a sense of how long that would take, as the law director mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8029)|
| 2:13:53| It's probably at least a couple-month process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8033)|
| 2:13:55| But that would be one way to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8035)|
| 2:13:58| One way would be to just fix the statute to make it clear that by the school putting their administrative offices in a building subject to federal security levels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8038)|
| 2:14:07| that does not violate their custody and control issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8047)|
| 2:14:10| There's a number of ways to address it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8050)|
| 2:14:12| It just would not happen by the time your vote—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8052)|
| 2:14:14| I think some of the many things we agreed on is, number one, you shouldn't vote on documents that are not essentially complete other than filling in dates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8054)|
| 2:14:22| I mean, so if we're not ready Monday with that, I would be right here with the law director saying we're not ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8062)|
| 2:14:28| I do think we can get them to you, but if we can't because there's still open issues, then I guess we won't be able to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8068)|
| 2:14:35| I think what the mayor and Chris have asked me, and you may say, why are you even involved in this, by the way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8075)|
| 2:14:40| I've been hired—I'm your bond counsel, and I have an engagement letter with you to help with special projects that involve financing and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8080)|
| 2:14:46| That's how I got involved in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8086)|
| 2:14:48| And it's been a real pleasure working with the law director and Charlie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8088)|
| 2:14:50| So I've been privileged to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8090)|
| 2:14:52| But what Chris and the mayor have really emphasized to me is they believe this is a great economic development project for the community, that this is very affordable office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8092)|
| 2:15:03| And if it does not work out that we can resolve the custody and control issues to the satisfaction of the law director and to the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8103)|
| 2:15:11| that they would like to proceed with this because of UT's verbal commitment to move forward with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8111)|
| 2:15:18| the opportunity to lock UT in and have their headquarters remain here in Knoxville for indefinitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8118)|
| 2:15:25| That is such a great opportunity to do that, that they would like to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8125)|
| 2:15:28| And then if we have to get an attorney general's opinion or fix this statutorily, we certainly can do that in the next few months and address the Board of Education issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8128)|
| 2:15:37| So it's not really as much of a rush to get—and I also, by the way, totally agree with the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8137)|
| 2:15:43| There's some incongruities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8143)|
| 2:15:45| I know that's a stupid word between the new MOU and the old MOU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8145)|
| 2:15:48| I think those have got to be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8148)|
| 2:15:49| I mean, I do—I think he and I talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8149)|
| 2:15:51| I just think it's something—they don't really relate to each other and don't really pick up that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8151)|
| 2:15:55| I know the intent was good, and I agree with what Commissioner Jay was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8155)|
| 2:15:59| It's clear what the intent was, but I do agree that there's some clarifications that certainly could be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8159)|
| 2:16:03| But I think the important thing that the mayor and Chris have asked me to emphasize is that they would like you all to proceed whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8163)|
| 2:16:11| and allow more time to work through the custody and control issues because it's a valid concern that the law director raised that we need to try to resolve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8171)|
| 2:16:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8179)|
| 2:16:20| How long would it take you to resolve those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8180)|
| 2:16:22| You said a couple of months or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8182)|
| 2:16:24| Well, it certainly is—the attorney general has no legal obligation to issue an opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8184)|
| 2:16:28| We would have to go to one of our state legislators to request the opinion is the way attorney general opinions work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8188)|
| 2:16:32| I'm sure we could get one of them to do that, and I'm sure any of you all could arrange for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8192)|
| 2:16:37| And sometimes they turn around in a couple weeks if they really are important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8197)|
| 2:16:41| Sometimes they sit on them for a good while if they are very busy, and so it's sort of I can't guarantee you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8201)|
| 2:16:47| My experience is one to two months is usually the period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8207)|
| 2:16:50| If we have to do a legislative fix to make it clear that this is okay, we're probably looking in March to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8210)|
| 2:16:56| We certainly can work with—we can certainly keep PBA continuing to do some planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8216)|
| 2:17:03| We've already done a tremendous amount of planning on the assumption the schools would move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8223)|
| 2:17:06| but we can avoid incurring too much additional cost until we get this issue resolved for the schools if that is deemed appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8226)|
| 2:17:15| So I hope to be able, if I'm back here next Monday, to be able to tell you, hey, it probably would take this long to get an attorney general's opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8235)|
| 2:17:22| and whether they would be willing to consider it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8242)|
| 2:17:25| Sometimes they just say, look, that's not an issue we're interested in diving in on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8245)|
| 2:17:29| But it's not the type of typical issue such as pending litigation or open legislation that prevents them from rendering an opinion on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8249)|
| 2:17:39| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8259)|
| 2:17:41| Thank you, Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8261)|
| 2:17:43| Back to Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8263)|
| 2:17:45| I know some of the other commissioners have spoken on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8265)|
| 2:17:48| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8268)|
| 2:17:50| You know, sitting here, Mr. Manitow, did I pronounce that correctly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8270)|
| 2:17:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8273)|
| 2:17:54| And our law director and I agree we need an attorney general's opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8274)|
| 2:17:58| That means it's March or April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8278)|
| 2:18:00| I got an attorney general's opinion with Representative Cain on whether judges can send its probation letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8280)|
| 2:18:07| And it took about two months to get that, but I did get it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8287)|
| 2:18:11| One of my concerns is that every year it seems like we hear about Congress wanting to sell TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8291)|
| 2:18:20| You know, Congress get out and the federal government get out of the power generating business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8300)|
| 2:18:25| I guess, Mr. Manitow and the law director, if TVA is sold within the next 20 years and it's gone to Georgia Power or Duke Power, what is this going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8305)|
| 2:18:37| I mean, they could tell us to get out of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8317)|
| 2:18:40| Legally, the easement is essentially like a lease in that they can't get us out of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8320)|
| 2:18:47| It's a valid legal instrument that we will have the right to retain our presence in the building if TVA was sold to a Duke Power or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8327)|
| 2:18:58| So it's just like if one landlord sold the building to another landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8338)|
| 2:19:03| That's certainly something I, like you, was worried about early on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8343)|
| 2:19:08| TVA's dissolution, TVA's sale shouldn't affect our legal rights under any of the easements that we're working on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8348)|
| 2:19:16| We might have a more friendly landlord or a thing, but it shouldn't affect the validity of any of our documents we're working with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8356)|
| 2:19:24| I can understand that, but being one building, a U-shaped building, which is not a great design, we don't know what that would be as far as that type of a concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8364)|
| 2:19:36| whether we would be able to be asked to move out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8376)|
| 2:19:41| I'm still maybe, you know, I've asked this question to a couple of developers, lawyers, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8381)|
| 2:19:48| I would not ever personally buy a piece of property that gives someone an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8388)|
| 2:19:58| I'm not going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8398)|
| 2:20:00| That piece of property is going to be my property or I will not buy it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8400)|
| 2:20:03| So convince me why the difference between a lease, which I think the law director says we're better off with a lease, and an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8403)|
| 2:20:13| Can you explain to me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8413)|
| 2:20:15| You're probably about the tenth person I've asked this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8415)|
| 2:20:17| Yeah, and that's one of the issues that the 99 percent that the law director and I agree upon, a lease or an outright purchase, would have been better than an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8417)|
| 2:20:26| Absolutely no doubt about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8426)|
| 2:20:27| If TVA, and this, you know, again, if we need them to put this in writing to this, they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8427)|
| 2:20:32| If TVA offered this for lease or for purchase, they would have to put it out for public sale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8432)|
| 2:20:37| and they pointed us to the statutes that require them to do that, and they're adamant about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8437)|
| 2:20:43| We've gone back and revisited it at least ten times and pushed them on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8443)|
| 2:20:46| We didn't want an easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8446)|
| 2:20:48| We wanted a lease or a purchase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8448)|
| 2:20:50| Their point is that they can't coordinate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8450)|
| 2:20:54| If they put it up for a lease, they'll end up with bottom feeder type folks trying to get it that they don't want to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8454)|
| 2:21:00| They want to work with us, so they don't want the risk of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8460)|
| 2:21:03| Also, they want to package it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| They want to package essentially the sale of the Summer Place complex with its 700 parking spaces and its office space with the East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8465)|
| 2:21:15| So if they put those up for lease or sale, they couldn't do that, and so they could end up with two different buyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8475)|
| 2:21:20| and they want to make sure we, the county, get them both because we need the parking from the Summer Place complex for the parking for the East Tower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8480)|
| 2:21:29| Is the easement a preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8489)|
| 2:21:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8490)|
| 2:21:31| From a real estate lawyer's perspective, I would have preferred something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8491)|
| 2:21:34| The first thing I did when I started to get engaged with it is talk to my friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8494)|
| 2:21:38| I mean I do a ton of real estate work, but I wanted to talk to other folks that I respect greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8498)|
| 2:21:43| Will an easement work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8503)|
| 2:21:45| And I'm very comfortable at this stage that is it our preference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8505)|
| 2:21:48| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8508)|
| 2:21:49| Is it workable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8509)|
| 2:21:51| Particularly when I've got it on my calendar if we move forward with this to make sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8511)|
| 2:21:55| although I'll be pretty old at that point in time, to make sure that we go back to TVA in five to seven years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8515)|
| 2:22:00| and ask them to sell us the underlying fee, which is what they just did in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8520)|
| 2:22:04| They did the Chattanoogan Hotel actually on this sort of thing, and then they went back and they bought the underlying fee later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8524)|
| 2:22:10| They just can't couple the two together, and they can't agree to do it ahead of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8530)|
| 2:22:14| and so that certainly will be our goal long term is to get fee simple title to Summer Place complex as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8534)|
| 2:22:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8542)|
| 2:22:23| Mr. Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8543)|
| 2:22:24| It's been mentioned a couple times that 38, 39 cents a square foot is a good value, a good price,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8544)|
| 2:22:32| but it's been mentioned a couple times tonight, and I believe you mentioned it in one of the articles that you had plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8552)|
| 2:22:38| Anyway, are you willing to tell us if this is not voted in, what is your plan still to go to TVA Towers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8558)|
| 2:22:46| Yes, because I think that with UT coming on board, and then also we talked about the need for more space,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8566)|
| 2:22:53| there are other things that we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8573)|
| 2:22:56| I would like to point out when we talk about 37.5 cents per square foot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8576)|
| 2:23:01| that we do have to include operation and maintenance in that, which we're estimating at $4 a square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8581)|
| 2:23:07| but that still puts us at $105 a square foot, essentially, which we can't get that anywhere else in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8587)|
| 2:23:15| especially for class A office space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8595)|
| 2:23:18| We are looking at two separate issues, as the law director said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8598)|
| 2:23:22| One is the contract, and one is the MOU of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8602)|
| 2:23:26| So certainly schools would be our preference, but if not, we could definitely figure out something to do with that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8606)|
| 2:23:33| So if you want to use that space for, I'm going to throw the name of purchasing, engineering, or whatever, and move up there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8613)|
| 2:23:44| a year from now or two years from now, we can still move, not say we, I shouldn't say that word,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8624)|
| 2:23:49| schools have a possibility of still moving there in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8629)|
| 2:23:54| We can also reconfigure this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8634)|
| 2:23:56| There's a lot of things that we have the option, that open up the option for us to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8636)|
| 2:24:06| I can see both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8646)|
| 2:24:08| There's great positives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8648)|
| 2:24:09| There's no, and it's tough, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8649)|
| 2:24:13| But, you know, I also don't want to sit here and argue over something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8653)|
| 2:24:20| trying to lease this space to move a school system that when, in two months from now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8660)|
| 2:24:27| you may sign an agreement and move some offices there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8667)|
| 2:24:32| You see what I'm saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8672)|
| 2:24:35| I don't know if we're really, are we at this point yet to where we need the Attorney General's opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8675)|
| 2:24:42| and I'm not asking you to tell us what your plans are because you're not ready to tell, I'm not asking you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8682)|
| 2:24:49| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8689)|
| 2:24:50| You know, it's turning into a very confusing situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8690)|
| 2:24:55| Well, I mean, it has, but again, we have to look at it as two separate issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8695)|
| 2:25:00| and one is schools, and the other is acquiring the TVA building, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8700)|
| 2:25:06| And tonight we're talking about TV, and at this juncture we're talking about TVA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8706)|
| 2:25:11| The MOU with schools is actually a separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8711)|
| 2:25:14| So, you know, again, if you were to ask me what would be my preference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8714)|
| 2:25:21| it would be to go ahead with the contract, as the Law Director makes a great point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8721)|
| 2:25:26| a completed contract that has all the blanks filled in, which we would require to have, you know, for you all to vote on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomwsr1467191209business?start=8726)|
