| 0:03:26| scenarios that we've developed so far. At the end of the day none of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=206)|
| 0:03:30| scenarios that are being proposed are going to be the scenario because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=210)|
| 0:03:33| going to be a combination of scenarios that are those three plus other ideas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=213)|
| 0:03:37| that come out of the process so don't be intimidated about what these are the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| only three scenarios that are out there. Second thing this I know we've sent out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=221)|

| 0:04:17| mentioned to you that when I was invited up to talk to the mayor's regarding this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=257)|
| 0:04:23| position they talked to me about how they city of Knoxville Knox County want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=263)|
| 0:04:30| to begin to build their planning staff they do not have planning staffs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| embedded within their agency so one of the aspects of this position that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=273)|
| 0:04:39| going on is that they want to build their staff up at the in the city of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=279)|
| 0:04:44| Knoxville and Knox County and be able to incorporate planning it within Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=284)|

| 0:04:58| building their team with their existing staff and this will be a transition over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=298)|
| 0:05:03| several months to embed planning staff within these various agencies city and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| Knox County so we are Knox County's moving ahead a little bit quicker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| they're more flexible and that and the city of Knoxville has HR and civil| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=313)|
| 0:05:17| service and that's what they can't not move it as quickly as so but we're we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| you know those things are happening nothing will change at the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=321)|
| 0:05:25| Commission level over the long term everything that you see will be coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=325)|
| 0:05:31| through Knoxville Knox County planning we'll still be doing all the work and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=331)|
| 0:05:34| activities for for that it's just that they'll be you know collaborate you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| there'll be city staff and county staff eventually they'll be dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=339)|
| 0:05:43| planning and zoning cases they'll be continue to work within our planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=343)|
| 0:05:47| offices continuing collaboration with city and county issues sharing of cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| if there's a caseload overload city side or county side as we move forward that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=351)|
| 0:05:56| we're building up those teams for city and county administration so as more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=356)|
| 0:06:02| information becomes available from the city and county and what we'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=362)|
| 0:06:05| come back and you know with the city and the county staff and just talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=365)|
| 0:06:08| their organizational structures and that how that whole teamwork will begin and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=368)|
| 0:06:12| then probably in the next you know maybe two or three months we can do that when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=372)|
| 0:06:16| the city gets there more of their organizational structure together so but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=376)|
| 0:06:20| the bottom line nothing's going to change within how the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=380)|
| 0:06:23| Commission operates so talk a little bit about what that does for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=383)|
| 0:06:30| autonomous right now we're kind of a quasi governmental agency and really not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=390)|
| 0:06:36| we are influenced we're financed by the city in the county obviously and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| appointed by the mayor's yeah but independent of that politically as far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=400)|
| 0:06:46| as our staff concerned where do you see that I think well we've always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=406)|
| 0:06:53| collaborated with city or county staff in cases obviously before us engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=413)|
| 0:06:58| public works stormwater drainage and that they've always been collaboration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=418)|
| 0:07:02| as part of this effort so I think this just formalizes from within the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| that they'll be able to take advantage of planning activities over the long| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| term with all their other departments or collaboration with planning and zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=431)|
| 0:07:16| activities both long term and short term versus at sometimes we felt as least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=436)|
| 0:07:22| planning staff that why weren't we aware of this that was going on in the city or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=442)|
| 0:07:25| at the county level so the independence of the commission will still be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| what's the budget as far as writing grant requests do you keep a staff and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| planning that does that or yeah we we have a staff and we will still retain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=454)|

| 0:07:58| activities that will all continue to be managed in fact there may be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=478)|
| 0:08:02| opportunities that will expand certain activities with with that to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| advantage of what you just indicate some grant opportunities where we've spent a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=487)|
| 0:08:11| lot of time with your staff on just preparing and getting ready for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=491)|
| 0:08:14| planning commission agenda items and that so Jeff so what would what would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=494)|
| 0:08:19| that do with so for example a reason request if the planning staff or so is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=499)|
| 0:08:29| who's going to write the recommend the staff recommendation is it ultimately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=509)|
| 0:08:32| going to be someone that reports to the mayor or is it because right now it has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=512)|
| 0:08:36| that independence of the planning office you know the mayor can't directly as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=516)|
| 0:08:43| much influence staff because they don't write I don't work for it right so you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=523)|
| 0:08:48| know are we setting up a potential incentive conflict of interest where you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| know political donations influence campaigns which then influence their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| reasons I think there be I would hope far enough removed from that that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=538)|
| 0:09:04| will not be influenced but there's you know there's always that influence that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=544)|
| 0:09:08| potentially could be out there and I can't deny that so I just you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=548)|
| 0:09:14| they're going to be embedded within you know engineering or public works or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| economic development with the city and again those haven't been at the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=559)|

| 0:09:30| win the you know instead of just having this county talk about their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=570)|
| 0:09:33| reorganization I want to have the city here at the same time but the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=573)|
| 0:09:39| commissioners were aware of this reorganization going on for several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=579)|
| 0:09:42| weeks some of the development community been aware of this going on so I felt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| it's important to share it with the commissioners and I don't have all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=585)|
| 0:09:49| information in front of us at this time so Jeff long-term how do you see what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=589)|
| 0:09:56| much left of your department you know right now it's referred to as Knox and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=596)|

| 0:10:13| of the of your organization for something like support services or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=613)|

| 0:10:23| like Pat I think again the whole transportation planning section will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=623)|

| 0:14:07| in a temporary housing I get one of the questions that we have staff is you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=847)|
| 0:14:14| should this be allowed by right just do the permitting process and if so is it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=854)|
| 0:14:20| is I mean AGs own property a residential lot is minimum of one acres I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=860)|
| 0:14:28| hear are we okay with that just being done through the permit process for all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=868)|
| 0:14:33| AG properties is there anybody have any thoughts on certain size properties you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| know if it's two acres or more five acres or more obviously the larger the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| property the less concern you're gonna have with issues with neighbors or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| anything like that but same time this really is intended to be temporary so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=887)|
| 0:14:51| hopefully we wouldn't have any issues at all but so I guess is the option is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=891)|
| 0:14:55| either well I'm all but just do all by right just through the permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| process with regular checkups and that permit like every six months they got to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=900)|

| 0:15:25| limit time limit because a lot of cases particularly with somebody's building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=925)|

| 0:15:48| I think it should be by right personally I would agree with that question I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=948)|
| 0:15:55| is why wouldn't your permit kind of run in alignment with building permit six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=955)|
| 0:16:05| months I don't know many people build a house in six months so it just seems a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| little senseless to make a guy come back in six months or girl that was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=969)|

| 0:16:20| first permit is a longer period than the every subsequent extension of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=980)|

| 0:17:12| of property three or four acres and we feel like kind of from a practical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| perspective it makes sense but the zoning ordinance doesn't allow it so it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| it occurs quite quite often| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| currently if they're doing it is it unpermitted yes if someone is living in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=1044)|

| 0:17:46| there's almost always a construction trailer that is on site that has some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=1066)|

| 0:17:58| how does this really differ from from that I mean other than that they are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=1078)|
| 0:18:02| living there but is there any rationale to sort of run it sort of parallel to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=1082)|
| 0:18:08| what that looks like and the difference is is there sleeping quarters and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| whereas in these you know the dwelling can constitutes you know sanitary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=1092)|

| 0:18:21| a little bit of distinction because sleeping quarters aren't there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=1101)|
| 0:18:27| but why don't we just let people live in them permanently as long as they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=1107)|

| 0:27:24| question is why didn't the landowner come forth with a rezoning request I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=1644)|

| 0:28:15| to take a proactive approach to this particular property given its current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=1695)|

| 0:28:34| and this is a heavily residential neighborhood so in anticipation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=1714)|
| 0:28:39| potential new opportunities for this property the city wanted to take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=1719)|

| 1:21:27| is that it wouldn't be any later than 9 p.m. obviously there'd be some lights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| associated with night play as well now one of the other recommendations if they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=4891)|

| 1:30:08| okay so the first first issue that we're going to talk about is design plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5408)|
| 1:30:15| approval so we are not removing the design plan process what we are removing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5415)|
| 1:30:20| is the certification so right now what happens is we get a subdivision that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5420)|
| 1:30:24| comes through you guys see it as a concept plan then it goes to engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5424)|
| 1:30:28| and utilities they look at it as a design plan and they kind of further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5428)|
| 1:30:31| tweak some things and kind of go through their own requirements and then it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| back to us again as a final plot as part of that final plot process we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| looking at whether or not it's in substantial compliance with the concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5439)|

| 1:30:47| to go back and take a look at it again so to us when we're looking at this the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5447)|
| 1:30:51| design plan certification is kind of just an extra hoop for them to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| jump through so if the design plan if obviously if the final plat is in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5455)|
| 1:30:59| substantial compliance with the concept plan then the design plan by default is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| also in substantial compliance and so it just seems like a lot of red tape to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| make people go through you know certifying process that they've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5467)|
| 1:31:11| through when we can kind of see that just by looking at the final plot so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5471)|
| 1:31:15| are so we are proposing to remove that just that certification form and there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5475)|
| 1:31:21| a number of places where this occurs so 2.2 b5 is what we're looking at now so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5481)|
| 1:31:27| you can see what's crossed out it says the planning staff shall require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| submission of statements certifying design plan approval so that's the part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5489)|
| 1:31:34| removing so now we're still saying that they need that design plan approval just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| doesn't have to be certified that occurs again there's other references to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5497)|

| 1:32:23| happens a lot of times this surveyors will copy and paste the note in its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| entirety onto the plat but not all of the note really applies to every plot so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5547)|
| 1:32:32| we're wanting to do is to take this section this last section that is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| section 2 was previously the last sentence of subsection 1 and that just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5556)|

| 1:35:04| surveyors are finding it hard to find that stamp so we're just putting the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5704)|

| 1:35:19| surveyors to find it so the next one is provisions for alternative design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5719)|
| 1:35:29| standards and again this is just kind of a housekeeping issue so you can see on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5729)|
| 1:35:35| here how we're adding some clarifying language next to each one so if you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| to section 3.03 v1 for example it talks about street frontage in pertaining to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5740)|
| 1:35:48| what would be the county's PR zone initially when this was created do we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| had planned zones in the city and the county but now it's it's basically just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| the county for 3.03 d1e maximum grade if you go to that section it's richer it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5755)|

| 1:36:05| changing anything they're just kind of making it more clear what they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5765)|
| 1:36:07| referring to so if you're looking at what kind of alternative design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5767)|
| 1:36:11| standards you need to comply with you kind of have a better understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| looking at this list what you could and couldn't do and then the next part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5774)|
| 1:36:20| that is the ones that can be approved by the city of Knoxville or Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| engineering and so these kind of go it's the same thing we're just adding some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5784)|
| 1:36:28| clarifying language next to this list however we are adding the ability for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5788)|
| 1:36:33| alternative design standards to be approved for corner radius productions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5793)|
| 1:36:37| and the agricultural residential and office zones so currently that's only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5797)|
| 1:36:41| available in commercial and industrial so we're just kind of adding that so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5801)|
| 1:36:44| that ability is within all zones and again that goes through the review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5804)|
| 1:36:49| process so there's opportunity for engineering to weigh in there's any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5809)|
| 1:36:54| concerns or site distance issues obviously that wouldn't be granted but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5814)|
| 1:36:58| this just gives them an avenue to be able to pursue this the next page we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5818)|
| 1:37:04| into exclusive permanent access easements so we did make some changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| pretty minor ones to this section so so the EPAE can only serve one lot and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5829)|
| 1:37:19| that's always been the case but it was a little bit vague as to how it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5839)|
| 1:37:23| written so if you cross through a lot to get to another lot you know do you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5843)|
| 1:37:30| Canada do you not historically we haven't and the reason we haven't is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5850)|
| 1:37:33| because if that low if that road has frontage and along a road and it's got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| site distance to where they could have a driveway the preference is to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| fewer curb cuts for safety issues and things like that and obviously if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5861)|
| 1:37:45| getting served by the roadway it really wouldn't be an easement so you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| really put give an easement through your own property so that's why we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5870)|
| 1:37:53| typically count that lot for for the exclusive permanent access easement the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5873)|
| 1:38:00| EPAE so right now we are just kind of clarifying that in here also it's only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5880)|
| 1:38:06| used for single-family and duplex lots only that's just typically how we see it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5886)|
| 1:38:10| so we're not changing anything they're just kind of providing that clarifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5890)|
| 1:38:13| language and then previously how it was worded it's talked about computing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5893)|
| 1:38:18| lot area of the lot or lots the easement crosses but really it's only designed to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| be crossing through one lot so we just added this clarifying language here it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5902)|
| 1:38:26| can be multiple lots for example if it straddles a lot line the next one was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5906)|
| 1:38:31| one of the bigger things that we did with this addition with this amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5911)|
| 1:38:35| right now if you have an easement that is serving just one property it's that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5915)|
| 1:38:42| exclusive permanent access easement we just talked about but as soon as you go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5922)|
| 1:38:45| up to two properties you have to all of a sudden hit a public right-of-way and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| there's a lot more criteria associated with that so you have to do a 40-foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5929)|
| 1:38:53| right-of-way instead of a 25-foot right-of-way in terms of the width you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5933)|
| 1:38:57| have to have an AASHTO turnaround you have to have a 12% grade there's just you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| know a lot of criteria and just for one extra lot it seems like a pretty big bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| to meet so we've added this the shared permanent access easement is kind of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5945)|
| 1:39:10| middle ground so this is designed to serve between two and five lots it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5950)|
| 1:39:14| kind of a hybrid of both the exclusive permanent access easement and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5954)|
| 1:39:18| private right-of-way so it's got more conditions attached to it than the EPAE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| but not quite as many as the permanent so that's the idea behind it so this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5962)|
| 1:39:28| this first section here is where it talks about serving a maximum of five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5968)|
| 1:39:31| lots it talks about how you're you know computing the lots and all that stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5971)|
| 1:39:35| it goes into serving single-family and duplex lots only like the EPAE the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5975)|
| 1:39:40| difference between this is that a lot with frontage on the public right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| would count towards this and the reason for that is we wanted to kind of make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| clear that once you hit that sixth lot it would be also a concept plan so the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5987)|
| 1:39:52| concept plan and the private right-of-way at this point would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5992)|
| 1:39:55| the same trigger they kind of go hand-in-hand so we really wanted to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5995)|
| 1:39:58| really intentional with that language applicants can seek a waiver from this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=5998)|
| 1:40:03| we did that build that into here so engineering departments can take a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6003)|
| 1:40:08| at that the SPAE will have access to a public street and only one connection so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6008)|
| 1:40:15| it's not going to be a through through easement connecting two streets again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6015)|
| 1:40:22| it's 25 foot in width there's some built language in here talking about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6022)|
| 1:40:26| surface width might need to be wider so if there are certain circumstances that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6026)|
| 1:40:30| would warrant that that wider wide away then engineering has the ability to ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| for that it's got to meet site distance criteria it will also serve for drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6034)|
| 1:40:39| and utility easements and we may end up requiring that actual turnaround anyway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6039)|
| 1:40:44| again this would be more triggered by the Fire Prevention Bureau than it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6044)|
| 1:40:49| be by the subdivision regulation so kind of letting that be the guide for when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6049)|
| 1:40:52| that turnaround would be necessary rather than the subdivision regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6052)|
| 1:40:56| so that's basically the changes that's will be added also the Homer homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6056)|
| 1:41:01| Association would be needed as well to make it clear who is going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| maintaining the easement the right-of-way so with that in mind for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6064)|
| 1:41:10| the private right-of-way so we changed that from having to serve from being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6070)|
| 1:41:14| triggered by two lots to being served by six so it's possible for it to be used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| for two or more but it's only required when it's six or more lots that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6078)|
| 1:41:22| being created and that's pretty much oh yeah one more sorry so we also added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6082)|
| 1:41:33| again this is just clarifying language it's not anything that's new and this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6093)|
| 1:41:37| going to be that 4.01 do you wanted to on your list this kind of goes into lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6097)|
| 1:41:43| widths and depths and so right now it's talking about the difference between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6103)|
| 1:41:50| when lot sizes and lot widths are specified in the zones and when they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6110)|
| 1:41:53| aren't so when they are specified within the zone the Planning Commission does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| not have their purview to issue a waiver or sorry a variance that has to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6117)|
| 1:42:02| through the BZA so that's just kind of clarifying in here that if it's a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| that that doesn't have those types of things for example the PR zone there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6125)|
| 1:42:08| no lot width it's kind of determined on you know the plan that you bring when we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6128)|
| 1:42:12| review it as is so this is talking about when the Planning Commission does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| have the purview to make those types of decisions so just clarifying language in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-221004-agenda-review?start=6136)|
