| 0:02:09| Please state your name and your business address and your relationship to the entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=129)|
| 0:02:14| My name is Joe Williver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=134)|
| 0:02:16| I'm the district manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=136)|
| 0:02:18| Our corporate office is in Greenville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| I don't have the address on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=139)|
| 0:02:21| I need the store address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| The store address is accurate, 8929 Oak Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| Did you hear the testimony of the officer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=146)|
| 0:02:27| Yes, sir, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=147)|
| 0:02:28| Did you admit or deny the offense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=148)|
| 0:02:30| Yes, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=150)|
| 0:02:31| You admit that, in fact, occurred?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=151)|
| 0:02:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| As a matter of fact, the boy, Sean Turley, was terminated that night, which is our policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| If you sell alcohol or tobacco to a minor, you're automatically terminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=159)|
| 0:02:43| Also, and our policy is the manager loses her bonus for that month, and she lost that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| The boy went through Knox County tips class, passed it, had his card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| We also do a TAMS class, which is Techniques Alcohol Management.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=173)|
| 0:02:57| We do that also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=177)|
| 0:02:58| He passed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| There is no excuse what he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=179)|
| 0:03:01| I can't tell you why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=181)|
| 0:03:03| Our registers are set up with the birthday in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=183)|
| 0:03:05| He failed to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| It's no excuse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| You know, each month we have classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=187)|
| 0:03:09| Well, not classes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| We have store meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=190)|
| 0:03:12| We stress two big things, alcohol, tobacco, ID, and safety and security for our employees and customers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=192)|
| 0:03:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| I'm going to defer to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=200)|
| 0:03:23| You're not under the Responsible Vendor Act, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=203)|
| 0:03:26| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=206)|
| 0:03:27| I believe only Rocky Top is at this point, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=207)|
| 0:03:29| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=209)|
| 0:03:31| I'd like to make a motion to the $500 fine for a 30-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=211)|
| 0:03:35| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=217)|

| 0:03:40| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| Is there a choice between remitting a $500 fine or suffer a 30-day suspension?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=221)|
| 0:03:45| If you want to remit the fine, it's for the seven days to the clerk of court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| We do the fine, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=229)|
| 0:03:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=230)|

| 0:04:45| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=285)|
| 0:04:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=286)|
| 0:04:47| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| We have the circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=288)|
| 0:04:50| I mean, what's your program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=290)|
| 0:04:53| Our servers have taken the tips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=293)|
| 0:04:57| Or servers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=297)|
| 0:04:58| I shouldn't say servers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=298)|
| 0:04:59| Clerks have all taken the tips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=299)|
| 0:05:02| I've spoke with the clerk involved, and we're normally very diligent about checking IDs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=302)|
| 0:05:11| This one just, he didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| Either the phone was ringing or there was something else going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=316)|
| 0:05:20| Looked at the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=320)|

| 0:05:24| No excuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=324)|

| 0:05:44| Application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=344)|
| 0:05:45| Rez Luga, Incorporated, Cancun Mexican Grill and Cantina, 4100 Crippen Road, on premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=345)|
| 0:05:54| Taking the fine or the fine?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=354)|
| 0:05:55| Which one did you choose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=355)|

| 0:05:59| Yes, he'll do the fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| Applicant here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| Yes, Your Honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=362)|
| 0:06:03| Yes, Mr. Lauter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=363)|
| 0:06:05| Sir, state your name for the record and your relationship to the business, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=365)|
| 0:06:09| Myself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=370)|
| 0:06:11| Robert Torres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=371)|
| 0:06:12| I'm the owner of the establishment, 4100 Crippen Road, Cancun Mexican Grill and Bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=372)|
| 0:06:21| Mr. Chairman, we're before the commission today asking for the issuance of a beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=381)|
| 0:06:28| Sir, your name for the record and your relationship to the organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=388)|
| 0:06:30| I'm Tommy Hyman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=390)|
| 0:06:31| I'm counsel attorney for the corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=391)|
| 0:06:34| Mr. Chairman, legal question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=394)|
| 0:06:38| If an attorney is speaking, are they supposed to be sworn for this also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=398)|
| 0:06:42| No, under Tennessee law, an attorney is an officer of the court, so they need not be sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=402)|
| 0:06:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=406)|
| 0:06:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=407)|
| 0:06:48| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=408)|
| 0:06:50| He has already received their liquor by the drink license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=410)|
| 0:06:54| and we're asking for the beer license to be granted today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=414)|
| 0:06:58| The issue before commission would be the variance, the 500-foot variance issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=418)|
| 0:07:06| They are within 100 feet of a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=426)|
| 0:07:11| It is my understanding that this commission is to take up an amendment tonight that will do away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=431)|
| 0:07:20| or essentially eliminate the variance issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| If that being the case, today I believe they have already been investigated by Officer Mays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=446)|
| 0:07:34| They have passed the background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| And as I said, they've already received their liquor by the drink permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=457)|
| 0:07:42| I'd ask that you grant a beer license contingent upon the action of this body this evening,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=462)|
| 0:07:52| changing the rules as far as the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=472)|
| 0:08:04| What kind of a hardship would it be for your client to be put on the next month's agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| Because, first of all, there's no presumption that the ordinance is going to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=488)|
| 0:08:12| And further, I'm a little concerned about any kind of retroactive application to the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=492)|
| 0:08:18| Well, first of all, well, it would be another month that they're open without the ability to serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=498)|
| 0:08:25| This is a Mexican restaurant, and it's going to cause a great deal of problems being a new establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=505)|
| 0:08:33| just having opened and not being able to serve beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=513)|
| 0:08:37| It will hurt them in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| And I'm not asking, and I don't think this should be construed as a variance for anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=519)|
| 0:08:48| I'm simply asking that you grant it contingent upon the passage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| Should that not occur this evening, then it's a moot issue, and we're back before codes asking for a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=533)|
| 0:09:00| But I think that it would place an undue burden upon them to have to wait another month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=540)|
| 0:09:07| Financially, it could be very crippling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=547)|
| 0:09:11| Commissioner Brown, we don't have a motion yet, do we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=551)|
| 0:09:13| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=553)|
| 0:09:14| No, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| No, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| I would like to make a motion that we postpone this for 30 days rather than get into any kind of legal hassle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=556)|
| 0:09:22| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=562)|
| 0:09:24| It's been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=565)|
| 0:09:26| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| On these gentlemen's side here, these guys have took a restaurant that wasn't that old and have just redone the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=568)|
| 0:09:36| They put as much money into the remodeling as what the first person did to build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| It's a nice, nice establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=581)|
| 0:09:43| They were covered up with a lot of people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=583)|
| 0:09:45| I drove by Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=585)|
| 0:09:46| There were a lot of people that were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=586)|
| 0:09:48| But I think we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=588)|
| 0:09:50| You know, if we can make it what the attorney has said, I don't see a problem with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| And if it doesn't pass tonight, then it is a moot point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=594)|
| 0:09:57| It saves these people from having to come back and come back downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=597)|
| 0:10:02| Commissioner Wright?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=602)|
| 0:10:03| Mr. Law Director, you were balancing the scales there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| You can't get out from under this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| What were you going to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=609)|
| 0:10:11| Well, no, I mean, my concern is always someone posing a challenge to the which would cause them even further hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=611)|
| 0:10:18| You know, could you conceptually pass it today, contingent upon?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| Is it a possibility that there won't be any legal challenges?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=624)|
| 0:10:26| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| I mean, if I thought it was a per se violation, I would just tell you that and say don't do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=627)|
| 0:10:31| regardless of their hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=631)|
| 0:10:33| But, you know, that's presuming, of course, this ordinance does pass tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| So in essence, both things would be dated the same, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=638)|
| 0:10:43| Well, the application is dated today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=643)|
| 0:10:45| Their ordinance is dated today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=645)|
| 0:10:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=649)|
| 0:10:50| The permit, though, would not be issued, obviously, unless and until the ordinance passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=650)|
| 0:10:54| It would fall within the parameters of that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=654)|
| 0:10:59| The motion on the floor is for a 30-day delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=659)|
| 0:11:02| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=662)|

| 0:11:34| I'm going to agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=694)|
| 0:11:38| Why don't you pass?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=698)|
| 0:11:39| So you want to pass or vote no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=699)|

| 0:15:12| Before you leave, see the young lady over here on the right side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| She has some information for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=916)|
| 0:15:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=918)|
| 0:15:20| Did anyone come in with the QQ Pizza on Maynardville Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=920)|
| 0:15:27| We'll defer this until next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=927)|
| 0:15:29| No other business to come before you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=929)|
| 0:15:30| Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=930)|
| 0:15:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=931)|
| 0:15:32| I wanted to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=932)|
| 0:15:33| I heard a rumor around the courthouse on maybe the last few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=933)|
| 0:15:36| Our illustrious Inspector Wolfie May recently got married.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=936)|
| 0:15:41| Anything to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| I'd just like to have a full report if that's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| I don't think he wants a full report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=947)|
| 0:15:49| You are still under oath, so watch yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=949)|
| 0:15:52| That's why he's buying Blue Moon and Coors Light now instead of Bud Light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=952)|
| 0:15:59| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=959)|
| 0:16:00| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| No other business to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=962)|
| 0:16:04| We are adjourned until 145.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=964)|
| 0:16:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=971)|
| 0:16:21| The Knox County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=981)|
| 0:16:23| This is the time where we have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| Also, we have honorariums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=985)|
| 0:16:27| Clerk, if you would call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=987)|
| 0:16:30| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=990)|
| 0:16:31| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| Commissioner Broyles?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| Commissioner Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=994)|
| 0:16:35| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=995)|
| 0:16:36| Commissioner Owenby?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| Commissioner Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| Commissioner Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1002)|
| 0:16:43| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1003)|
| 0:16:44| Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1005)|
| 0:16:46| Commissioner Schatz?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1006)|
| 0:16:47| Ten members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1007)|
| 0:16:48| He's in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| You want to do it from there, Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1012)|
| 0:16:55| We do have a quorum present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| And we have a very special honorarium here that I would like to present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1017)|
| 0:17:02| And I'd like to ask Rebecca Farrar from the Knoxville News Sentinel if she would come forward, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| Rebecca, if you would join me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1027)|
| 0:17:13| This is a surprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| This is why we didn't put it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| So we may have violated something, Rebecca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1035)|
| 0:17:17| So I hope that the News Sentinel doesn't sue us for doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1037)|
| 0:17:20| But I'm just kidding, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| Rebecca is retiring from the Knoxville News Sentinel after a distinguished career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1042)|
| 0:17:27| And the resolution says, in part, recognizes her work as a graduate of the University of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1047)|
| 0:17:33| worked with the Mountain Press News in Sevierville before she joined the Sentinel 84.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1053)|
| 0:17:37| She spent 11 years in Nashville covering the legislature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1057)|
| 0:17:40| And, of course, most of us know her here in Knox County having covered the police beat as well as Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1060)|
| 0:17:47| And she covered Knox County government during some of our good times and some of our not-so-good times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| But she has always been fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1072)|
| 0:17:53| And I must say, though, that there have been times when I would see on my phone a call from Rebecca Farrar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1073)|
| 0:17:59| I wish I didn't have to return the call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1079)|
| 0:18:01| I'm sure many of you have felt the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1081)|
| 0:18:03| But we did want to recognize you today, Rebecca, and say thank you for your work on behalf of the citizens of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1083)|
| 0:18:08| And we in commission have respected what you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1088)|
| 0:18:10| And we wish you well in your retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1090)|
| 0:18:12| And so you'll have to stay in touch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| And maybe you'll come back and attend some meetings as a citizen next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1094)|
| 0:18:19| But if you'd like to say something to the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1099)|
| 0:18:21| I just want to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| And I want to say how much I've enjoyed covering the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1103)|
| 0:18:26| You guys always kept me on my toes, that's for darn sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1106)|
| 0:18:29| Especially during Black Wednesday and all those days, the Sunshine Trial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1109)|
| 0:18:33| I mean, it was actually fun for a reporter to be covering all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| So I've really enjoyed covering you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| And you've always been so cooperative with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1119)|
| 0:18:41| You've all called me back when I needed to talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| And I've really, really appreciated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1124)|
| 0:18:46| So thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| I will treasure this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| We're going to get a picture made with Rebecca as soon as we finish here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1134)|
| 0:18:57| You need to see her privately for the rest of the story, though, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1137)|
| 0:19:02| And, Rebecca, one more time for the record, no comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1142)|
| 0:19:16| We have one other honorarium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| Clerk, if you'd read it in the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| I guess we need to formally vote on Rebecca, don't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1162)|
| 0:19:24| Did we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1164)|
| 0:19:25| We didn't do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1165)|
| 0:19:26| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1166)|
| 0:19:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1167)|
| 0:19:28| And this could have a mayoral override, of course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1168)|
| 0:19:31| You might veto this, Rebecca.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1171)|
| 0:19:33| But do we have a motion that we approve the resolution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1173)|
| 0:19:35| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1177)|
| 0:19:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| The next item is Resolution 101.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| It is declaring a moment of remembrance of the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1187)|
| 0:19:52| committed against the United States on September 11, 2001.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1192)|
| 0:19:57| I guess you've received notification that there will be a ceremony here on September the 9th at 9 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1197)|
| 0:20:04| and so we invite everyone, all of our citizens, as well as all of the elected officials, to be there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1209)|
| 0:20:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| The motion is adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| Any other resolutions or anything, any other item to come before us during this segment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| I know we have an individual who has signed up to speak on public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1219)|
| 0:20:22| but I believe they want to speak when we're considering the resolution on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| with the monies towards cerebral palsy, so we'll recognize that person at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1226)|
| 0:20:31| Commissioner Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1231)|
| 0:20:33| I don't know if this is proper or not, but is this where we would add something to consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1233)|
| 0:20:38| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1238)|
| 0:20:39| No, we'll do that at 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1239)|
| 0:20:41| Well, we're going to adjourn this segment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| Rebecca, if we could ask you to come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1243)|
| 0:20:45| The commissioners would like to have a picture with you so that you could have it properly framed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1245)|
| 0:20:48| and put over your fireplace so you can always remember us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1248)|
| 0:20:51| So we are adjourned until 2 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1251)|
| 0:21:08| At 2 o'clock, it is time for the regular meeting of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1268)|
| 0:21:11| This is August 22, 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1271)|
| 0:21:14| Clerk, if you'd call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1274)|
| 0:21:16| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1276)|

| 0:21:26| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1286)|
| 0:21:27| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1287)|

| 0:21:29| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1289)|
| 0:21:30| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1291)|
| 0:21:32| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1292)|
| 0:21:33| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1295)|

| 0:21:37| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Our devotional will be led by Commissioner Jeff Owenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| You're over two today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1300)|
| 0:21:41| I know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| People keep talking to me and distract me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| Usually, I just pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1303)|
| 0:21:45| But I want to tell you the reason, and I've thought about this since I was asked to do devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1305)|
| 0:21:54| I've only been here almost a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| And some of the things that are said, I know you're supposed to have thick skin when you're a politician,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1316)|
| 0:22:03| but I'm not really a politician.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1323)|
| 0:22:06| I'm a regular citizen that just wanted to make a change and make a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1326)|
| 0:22:10| And over this past year, I've seen people on blogs and stuff insinuate that I'm not smart enough to be up here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1330)|
| 0:22:18| and all this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1338)|
| 0:22:20| And it's not just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| It's other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| I read blogs about Amy and others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1342)|
| 0:22:26| I just think that's very wrong and very disrespectful to that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1346)|
| 0:22:32| We can disagree on a lot of issues, but we can be respectful when we do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1352)|
| 0:22:39| And that's what I would like to see from commissioners and the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1359)|
| 0:22:44| You know, I mean, so when you get out there and you start blogging, it's on the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| Everybody sees it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1368)|
| 0:22:49| And my kids and my wife and others, so my wife.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1369)|
| 0:22:53| I only got one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1373)|
| 0:22:57| Not from Iowa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1377)|
| 0:22:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| Oops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1379)|
| 0:23:02| But, I mean, just remember that these people have families, and we serve for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1382)|
| 0:23:09| And I am an educated person, not as smart as some of these people up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| But I am working on my degree to finish it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1395)|
| 0:23:18| And just because you may disagree with me or disagree with something I say doesn't mean you have to say I'm not educated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1398)|
| 0:23:26| So I just want to say that point, and let's pray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| Dear Lord, thank you very much for this day and for giving us the opportunity to serve our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1411)|
| 0:23:36| and do the best that we feel is necessary to move this county forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1416)|
| 0:23:42| and make the decisions that's right for the people as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1422)|
| 0:23:47| I ask that you please pray for the people that may disagree with me, but that we can do it civilly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1427)|
| 0:23:56| or disagree with anybody else, that we can do it civilly and just agree that we disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1436)|
| 0:24:02| but we can still go be friends afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| So I want to thank you for this time and for allowing me another day on this glorious earth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1445)|
| 0:24:11| I pray to you in Jesus Christ's glorious name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1451)|
| 0:24:14| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1454)|
| 0:24:15| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| Tony Norman will lead us in the Pledge of the Flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| I salute the flag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1462)|
| 0:24:27| and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1472)|
| 0:24:39| Next item is the approval of minutes to the previous meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1479)|
| 0:24:42| Do I have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Motion approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1484)|
| 0:24:45| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1486)|
| 0:24:47| Next, amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1487)|
| 0:24:48| I'd like to withdraw items R11-8-903, which is on page eight, and also R-11-8-906.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1488)|
| 0:25:00| Are there any other amendments to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| I have an amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1504)|
| 0:25:05| Mr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1505)|
| 0:25:06| I have an amendment for a resolution that I want to put on here on behalf of the school board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1506)|
| 0:25:11| that wants to speak to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1511)|
| 0:25:13| Joe Lee is making copies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1513)|
| 0:25:15| Somebody is making copies right now, and they'll have this distributed to you by the time we get to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1515)|
| 0:25:21| Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1521)|
| 0:25:22| Yes, Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| I would object to anything being added to today's agenda about Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| If that's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| I don't know if we'd have to process, but that's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| It will take two-thirds vote to get it on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1532)|
| 0:25:35| So do we want to go ahead and vote on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1535)|
| 0:25:37| You know, I didn't mean for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| I don't know if I'd even vote for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1539)|
| 0:25:41| I would put it on there just to have it because that way we could have a discussion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| If not, I'll just go ahead and withdraw it and put it on some other time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1545)|
| 0:25:48| I respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1548)|
| 0:25:50| So you want to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1550)|
| 0:25:51| I would just withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1551)|
| 0:25:52| Withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| I don't want to discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| Commissioner Orlandi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| I'd like to add R-11-8-905 and put it on the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1563)|
| 0:26:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| 905.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Any objection to having that put on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1571)|
| 0:26:15| We'll read that when we read the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1575)|
| 0:26:17| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| I didn't...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| I couldn't hear everything you were saying, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1582)|
| 0:26:24| You said you wanted to withdraw R-11-8-903.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1584)|
| 0:26:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1589)|
| 0:26:31| And what was it about R-11-8-906?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1591)|
| 0:26:36| Withdraw that one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1596)|
| 0:26:37| Well, if it's not been added yet, can we withdraw it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1597)|
| 0:26:41| We added it last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1601)|
| 0:26:42| We added it last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1602)|
| 0:26:43| It was on our workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| Any other items that need to be added?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| Dr. Buchanan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1611)|
| 0:26:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1612)|
| 0:26:53| Name and address of the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| Martha Buchanan, 140 Dameron Avenue, Director of Knox County Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| I do not remember the number, but it was given a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| I'd like to add the state grant for diabetes education and prevention, which is a limited-time funding grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1620)|
| 0:27:07| So I'd like to go ahead and add that, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1627)|
| 0:27:10| Without objection, it will be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| Also on page 7, item number 804, the law department is requesting a 30-day deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1635)|
| 0:27:24| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1644)|
| 0:27:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1645)|
| 0:27:26| Both attorneys on this issue have been filing lengthy pleadings, most of which are legal in nature that bear scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1646)|
| 0:27:32| And I request a postponement for 30 days until the next commission meeting, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| So this item, page 7, item number 804, will be deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1658)|
| 0:27:44| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| In reference to item 903, I thought it might be healthy for us, given that it was going to be withdrawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1668)|
| 0:27:58| in all the events that have happened this last week, that we might benefit from some airing of the topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1678)|
| 0:28:07| and moving it to a discussion item, if for nothing else, just our benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1687)|
| 0:28:13| just to hear each other's thoughts and comments on what took place and why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| So that would be my suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| So you're wanting to add a discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| What does that need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| Does that need approval or anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1708)|
| 0:28:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1710)|
| 0:28:31| On a voting issue, it's just a discussion item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| I had, are we still, are you still planning to defer R-11-8-901 about the county information?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1715)|
| 0:28:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| We deferred that for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1730)|
| 0:28:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1731)|
| 0:28:52| And I was wondering, we're deferring the R-11-8-804 for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1732)|
| 0:29:00| But someone had mentioned to me that they might come and speak today during public forum regarding that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1740)|
| 0:29:07| And if we defer it, I just want to, if they made an effort to get down there today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| I would like to give them the opportunity to speak if they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| If they're not here, they want to come back next month, that's fine, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1755)|
| 0:29:19| So if you would just ask if anybody wanted to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1759)|
| 0:29:23| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| I had a question about the one that Commissioner Broyles was just talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| The law department asked you to defer that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Yes, sir, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1774)|
| 0:29:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Because there's a ----| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1776)|
| 0:29:37| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| I just didn't know who.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1778)|
| 0:29:39| Pleadings involved that are filed are legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| That's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| Are there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1781)|
| 0:29:42| I'd like to ask Joe if it's a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| Of course, he can speak during public forum, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| But can we, since there is no agenda item now that it's postponed, is there discussion about it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1786)|
| 0:29:54| Well, not in terms of commission discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1794)|
| 0:29:57| But, I mean, if a citizen wants to come and speak on it, certainly they're entitled to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1797)|
| 0:30:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| I'd also like to move item 802 to the top of the agenda after we read the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1802)|
| 0:30:06| That's the one with appropriating funds for different departments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1806)|
| 0:30:09| We have some non-profit folks who are here that we'd like to go ahead and hear from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1809)|
| 0:30:13| So we'll do that first with no objection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| Any other amendments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1815)|
| 0:30:16| If not, do I hear a motion that we add what needs to be added, defer what needs to be deferred,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| and change what needs to be changed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1820)|
| 0:30:21| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1821)|
| 0:30:22| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1822)|
| 0:30:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1823)|
| 0:30:24| Our agenda is set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1824)|
| 0:30:25| Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=1825)|

| 0:40:48| And he said, you know, if we could get an additional $4,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2448)|
| 0:40:52| I think that we could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2452)|
| 0:40:56| So I told him that I would contact the mayor's office and if we had some funds available,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| that I would personally recommend that we see if we could get them $4,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2460)|
| 0:41:04| because I believe these folks know how to stretch a dollar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2464)|
| 0:41:08| They don't need to go very, very far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2468)|
| 0:41:12| And so I also agreed that our company would assist them in a fundraiser, which we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2472)|
| 0:41:16| And we were able to raise about $4,000 through a fundraiser| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2476)|
| 0:41:20| and we're working on some other fundraisers for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2480)|
| 0:41:24| And so Mr. Bob Sexton is here. If any of you have any questions for him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| I believe some of his clients are here that they serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| He's available to answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| So we raised about $4,000 for the Cerebral Palsy Center from the funds that we have found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2496)|
| 0:41:40| Then on Friday morning, I had never been to ETTAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| And, again, I'm ashamed to say that I had never been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2504)|
| 0:41:48| But I went there, spent over an hour, went through their facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2508)|
| 0:41:52| And, again, it's one of those things that when you see what they do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| and you see the services that they provide, they're asking for $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| If you have an individual in your home that cannot use their arms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2520)|
| 0:42:05| they have devices, they have toys for children, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| that can be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2529)|
| 0:42:13| They have volunteers that can repair wheelchairs, motorized vehicles, toys, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2533)|
| 0:42:17| on a volunteer basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| They told me that last year they gave $93,000 worth of equipment to individuals in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| They're asking for $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| I would recommend that we provide them with the $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2549)|
| 0:42:33| I believe some of them may be here as well to answer any questions that you may have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2553)|
| 0:42:37| So I wanted to begin our discussion today because those are two organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2557)|
| 0:42:41| that I have visited firsthand, have talked with them a great length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| And, again, I appreciate the work that our citizens panel has done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| but I also know that it's very difficult for them to visit the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| and see some of the work that's being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| And I've also been to the Sertoma Center on several occasions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| It's just that I've been there quite a bit over the course of the years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2581)|
| 0:43:05| I'm much more familiar with them than I am with the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2585)|
| 0:43:09| So I wanted to begin our discussion today and see if there were any other questions or comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2589)|
| 0:43:13| And we'll begin with Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2597)|
| 0:43:21| You know, I definitely understand and agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2601)|
| 0:43:25| in that there are some great organizations out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2605)|
| 0:43:29| but the other ones that did not get grant applications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| couldn't make a strong, strong case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2613)|
| 0:43:37| When I question the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2617)|
| 0:43:41| and how we got to these particular organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2621)|
| 0:43:45| I'm not questioning the veracity of the workers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| and the need. The need is there. The need is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| And you did a very eloquent job of pointing out these particular five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2633)|
| 0:43:57| My question is, how do they stack against the others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2637)|
| 0:44:01| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2641)|
| 0:44:05| These are great organizations. There may be a greater, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2645)|
| 0:44:09| or in your opinion, or in his or her opinion, organization that may be more needy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| or more deserving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2653)|
| 0:44:17| So there was a line. So the best way that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2657)|
| 0:44:21| said that we could get there was we'll get a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| panel of our citizens, because we have a jaded view on these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2665)|
| 0:44:29| We have our likes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2669)|
| 0:44:33| We work heavily in our communities, and we work with several organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| and we have passions in one way or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2677)|
| 0:44:41| But let's get a citizen review panel that will kind of vet out some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2681)|
| 0:44:45| I like this one more than I like that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2685)|
| 0:44:49| And we'll balance this out, and we'll let that panel go through their process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2689)|
| 0:44:53| and tell us what their views are as a group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2693)|
| 0:45:01| Grant, could you briefly describe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| the citizen review process in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| maybe the average number of meetings that each particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2709)|
| 0:45:13| panel attended, what type of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2713)|
| 0:45:17| applications they vetted, and what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| actual voting process is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| Grant Rosenberg, Director of Knox County Community Development, 400 Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| I'm sorry. Yeah, I know. So I just wanted you to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2729)|
| 0:45:33| briefly describe the process. So how large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| is a panel? How many times on average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| over the last few years did they meet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| What's the application process? Do they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| present to the teams? You know, just kind of if you could go through the whole process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2750)|
| 0:45:54| as briefly as you can. I'll do my best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2754)|
| 0:45:58| The panelists were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| an advisory committee to Mayor Burchett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2762)|
| 0:46:06| We approached the county commission back in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2766)|
| 0:46:10| I believe it was January, asked for a name from each of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| the commissioners to populate these panels. We had three different panels,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| education and youth, health and human services, and arts and cultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| And we populated the names that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| commission provided to us, as well as five appointees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2786)|
| 0:46:30| from the mayor himself. Those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2790)|
| 0:46:34| panelists, each of those three panels met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2794)|
| 0:46:38| I believe three times. We had an orientation, I'm sorry, twice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| We had an orientation, distributed all of the applications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| In each of those categories, the panelists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| had I think three weeks or so to evaluate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2810)|
| 0:46:54| each of the applications. They ranked them. I don't have the ranking in front of me. I did send| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2814)|
| 0:46:58| an email out on Friday with all of the applications and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2818)|
| 0:47:02| the whole process laid out. And the panels got back together,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2822)|
| 0:47:06| met for about on average, each panel met on average| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2826)|
| 0:47:10| about three or four hours going through each proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| Agencies had an opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| speak if there were any questions raised. And the panelists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| would turn in their score sheets after each agency went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| the process. We compiled those scores and ranked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| them. And then the panelists were given a number, a funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2850)|
| 0:47:34| number, and applied funding to each of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| agencies based on the ranks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2858)|
| 0:47:42| That's in a nutshell, the quickest way I could explain it to you, how the process worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2862)|
| 0:47:46| So the panelists didn't know that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2866)|
| 0:47:50| they were going to get the first 12 would be funded and the bottom 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2870)|
| 0:47:54| would not. They were kind of in blinders. All they did was take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2874)|
| 0:47:58| a peer look at these applications and rank them. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2878)|
| 0:48:02| Okay. So thank you. And, you know, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| that, and I'll speak for Grant, that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2886)|
| 0:48:10| has evolved over the last few years. I know I've been on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2890)|
| 0:48:14| this commission. I think it's improved each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2894)|
| 0:48:18| His team has worked hard to hone that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2898)|
| 0:48:22| process. And I, again, and R. Larry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| will tell you, we showed up over there at the Community Justice Center and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| said, well, I'm not necessarily going to vote wholeheartedly with what you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2910)|
| 0:48:34| say. I want to put my rubber stamp on it. But in time, I think this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2914)|
| 0:48:38| process works. Can you salt something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| here and there and skew your numbers? You can always do that. But I don't, I think they have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| the measures in place that will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2926)|
| 0:48:50| lend us some good numbers, lend the mayor good numbers to take a look at and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| evaluate and appropriate funds. And then us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2934)|
| 0:48:58| be the final say on it. So I just, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2938)|
| 0:49:02| and then going in afterwards and picking here and there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| I think this skews that whole process. So for these last five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2947)|
| 0:49:11| they may be the best five. I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2951)|
| 0:49:15| But I guess I just question the method| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2955)|
| 0:49:19| that we got to this supplemental funding. Mr. Bross.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2963)|
| 0:49:27| I want to reiterate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2967)|
| 0:49:31| what Sam said as far as the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| We ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2975)|
| 0:49:39| volunteers to come in, spend their time both here in meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2979)|
| 0:49:43| and at home doing these evaluations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2983)|
| 0:49:47| And they work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| really hard and they do a good job. Now, are they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| able to visit all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2995)|
| 0:49:59| 90 or however many organizations? No, but a lot of them are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| already familiar with organizations in their communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| And they've certainly, you know, I think we all tried to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| recommend someone that we knew would perform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3011)|
| 0:50:15| their due diligence and do the work, the background work that they needed to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3015)|
| 0:50:19| informed decisions. When I look at these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3019)|
| 0:50:23| organizations and I look at the rankings that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| citizen review panel put out and recommended to the mayor and that came to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3031)|
| 0:50:35| for approval during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| the budget vote have pretty much followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3039)|
| 0:50:43| what the citizen review panel said. We followed their rankings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3043)|
| 0:50:47| and divided up the money according to how they rank these organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| But when I look at these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3051)|
| 0:50:55| for instance, the Shangri-La| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3055)|
| 0:50:59| Therapeutic Academy of Writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3059)|
| 0:51:03| it ranked 29th out of 41| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3063)|
| 0:51:07| organizations. In fact, there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| six organizations that the citizen review panel ranked higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| than the Academy of Writing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| did not receive funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3079)|
| 0:51:23| On the other ones that were in health and human services panel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3083)|
| 0:51:27| there were 30 and, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3087)|
| 0:51:31| the Sertoma Center was ranked 25th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3091)|
| 0:51:35| out of that 30 and there were 11| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| organizations ranked higher than them according to the panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3099)|
| 0:51:43| that received no funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| Now this has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| these organizations do good work. We're strictly talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3111)|
| 0:51:55| the work that the citizen review panel did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3115)|
| 0:51:59| I think it can be argued that great work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| is true for almost every one of these organizations. I don't see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3123)|
| 0:52:07| only maybe one or two that I don't think aren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| fabulous, doing a great job, and providing a valuable service to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3131)|
| 0:52:15| county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| And I'm really disappointed that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3139)|
| 0:52:24| some of us have questioned the process by which this was done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| Our commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| to non-profits, to people with disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| to community organizations has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3156)|
| 0:52:40| questioned. The reason that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| all these organizations didn't receive any funding at budget time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3164)|
| 0:52:48| was because the mayor cut the budget and cut the funding for these programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| And I worked really hard to get funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3172)|
| 0:52:56| reinstated for some of these non-profits. I worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3176)|
| 0:53:00| very hard on that. I spoke to you all about that at length.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3180)|
| 0:53:04| And you all agreed to cut the funding for these organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3184)|
| 0:53:08| And I'm fine with that because that's what we as a body chose to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3188)|
| 0:53:16| Now, as far as whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| these organizations get money today, I think if we've got the money and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| can give it out, that's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3204)|
| 0:53:28| I am concerned that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| held the Citizen Review Panel's work in high esteem until this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| And right now, we're not. And I would like to apologize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3216)|
| 0:53:40| to them for that. I also think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| that as far as the Cerebral Palsy Center, that's right down the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3224)|
| 0:53:48| street from me. And a lot of these places, I have been including that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3228)|
| 0:53:52| And I worked really hard to help them organize an email campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3232)|
| 0:53:56| And it made a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| And I'm very proud of the work that they do. I'm proud of the work that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3240)|
| 0:54:04| East Tennessee Technology Access Center does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3244)|
| 0:54:08| And the Alzheimer's Association. And the Sertoma Center. All of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3248)|
| 0:54:12| are very important organizations. They do great work. But that could be said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3252)|
| 0:54:16| of the 11 or the 17 organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3256)|
| 0:54:20| that were ranked higher by the panel and didn't receive any funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| Now that the budget process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3264)|
| 0:54:28| is over, I have to say that I'm really pleased that the Mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3268)|
| 0:54:32| is in agreement now that a lot of these organizations deserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| more funding than what we've given them. I think it shows some real growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| And I'm proud of him for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| I do think that we need to respect the process of the Citizen Review Panel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3284)|
| 0:54:48| And, no, it's not perfect. Absolutely. And I think some changes need to be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3288)|
| 0:54:52| But we followed their recommendations at budget time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3292)|
| 0:54:56| And I think we should follow the recommendations now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| Mr. Sexton is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3300)|
| 0:55:04| I believe you'd like to address this. Mr. Sexton is the Executive Director of the Cerebral Palsy Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3304)|
| 0:55:08| Thank you for being here. And if you'd like to recognize any individuals that you brought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| Okay. Thank you. And thank you for the opportunity just to make a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3312)|
| 0:55:16| Just for the record, I'm Bob Sexton, Executive Director of the Cerebral Palsy Center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3316)|
| 0:55:20| 5333 Beverly Oaks Drive, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3320)|
| 0:55:24| I just wanted to make a couple of comments. And my comments really fall on both| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3324)|
| 0:55:28| sides of these arguments. Four years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| our agency received $27,500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| from Knox County. And what was approved for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3336)|
| 0:55:41| this year is $5,100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| So that's an 83% reduction in funds from Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3345)|
| 0:55:49| for our agency over the last four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3349)|
| 0:55:53| So on the one side of the argument, I agree there simply has not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| been enough money set aside to assist the nonprofits to do their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3357)|
| 0:56:01| In our case, it actually has led recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| to some consideration that after 57 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| our agency may have to close because not only an 83%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| reduction from Knox County, but nearly, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| $300,000 in cuts from the state. We all know the state budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3377)|
| 0:56:21| is also, you know, very, very tight. And just the general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3381)|
| 0:56:25| economy, we have lost about $100,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3385)|
| 0:56:29| in other revenue sources just from local citizens and companies and foundations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3389)|
| 0:56:33| and civic clubs just because of what we're all aware of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3393)|
| 0:56:37| the shape of the economy. So $400,000 loss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3397)|
| 0:56:41| in revenue to our relatively small agency over the last four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| has just stressed us to the point where we have to consider whether we can continue or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| So that is one reason that we said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| an 83% cut over the last four years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3413)|
| 0:56:57| from Knox County just goes beyond what we should have to suffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3417)|
| 0:57:01| We know that everyone has to cut back. And even if we're granted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3421)|
| 0:57:05| the additional $4,000 today, that's still a 25% cut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| over what we received last year from Knox County. So isn't that more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| in perspective with what cuts we all are expected to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3433)|
| 0:57:17| Now, the other side of our argument is that I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3437)|
| 0:57:21| really be a person that would be 100% for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3441)|
| 0:57:25| the citizen review process, except having gone through it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3445)|
| 0:57:29| this year, I can prove to each of you, if you would allow me the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3449)|
| 0:57:33| and bring the paperwork in here, that I should have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3453)|
| 0:57:37| the fact that I received the $5,100 means that our agency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3457)|
| 0:57:41| did fall within the funding parameters for the one panel that we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3461)|
| 0:57:45| one of our programs in, but there was another program that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3465)|
| 0:57:49| submitted to a separate panel that some of the panel members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3469)|
| 0:57:53| did not understand their directions adequately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3473)|
| 0:57:57| and they scored our application low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3477)|
| 0:58:01| because they said a document was not in the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3481)|
| 0:58:05| which Grant Rosenberg will tell you was not required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3485)|
| 0:58:09| to be in the application. And, in fact, the training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| of the citizen volunteers was, do not look for this document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| with agency or programs that were not previously funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| And so they marked me down there because that was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| in there, yet it was not supposed to be in there. And then what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3505)|
| 0:58:29| did not discuss further with Mr. Rosenberg, because at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3509)|
| 0:58:33| we felt like I would still have been one position out of funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3513)|
| 0:58:37| but what I did not discuss further because it was already sold,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3517)|
| 0:58:41| the mayor's recommendations had already been given to you all when I realized this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3521)|
| 0:58:45| at the very bottom of the form is a last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3525)|
| 0:58:49| criterion. So the application is complete and accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3529)|
| 0:58:53| The same volunteers that didn't understand earlier that that document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3533)|
| 0:58:58| wasn't supposed to be in there gave zero scores because how could the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3538)|
| 0:59:02| be complete and accurate if the earlier document was missing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3542)|
| 0:59:06| And three out of the four volunteers in that panel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| did not understand their training, and one did, and gave high| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| scores in those areas. So in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| normally I'm a fan, but I think the citizen review process needed more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3558)|
| 0:59:22| oversight and make sure everybody understood their training. And in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3562)|
| 0:59:26| it's very clear it kicked the second program of ours out of funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| And so had we got that, our allocation amount would have been the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| or very close to what it was last year. So I see both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| of the argument. And whatever you can do, I would appreciate it. There are some individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| here. I did not ask a whole lot of people to come down here out of respect for you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| but a couple of families are here with their individuals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| and if you have a moment to allow them to say something, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| Yes, if you'd like to address us, we'd like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3594)|
| 1:00:10| I'm Tammy Cook, and this is Billy Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| And Billy works at Papa John's on campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| And he makes pizza boxes for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| He gets services through the Cerebral Palsy Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3622)|
| 1:00:26| And without the Cerebral Palsy Center, Billy wouldn't have a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3626)|
| 1:00:30| I'm sure of it. They have a team called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| the Seamless Transition Project, which goes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| They take them from the last year of high school and take them out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| and find jobs for them. And Billy was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3642)|
| 1:00:46| one of the young men that was able to get a job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3646)|
| 1:00:50| Twice a month, every month, an individual from the Cerebral Palsy Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3650)|
| 1:00:54| will go to his place of employment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3654)|
| 1:00:58| and check on him, make sure that his job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| is okay and that he's not having any issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3662)|
| 1:01:06| And Billy really loves his job. And without the Cerebral Palsy Center and without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3666)|
| 1:01:10| the help that he gets there, he probably wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3670)|
| 1:01:14| have a job. And Billy's really happy to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3674)|
| 1:01:18| working there. And we're happy that he's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3678)|
| 1:01:22| Could you give us your name and address of the record, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| Tammy Cook at 4504 Fawney Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3686)|
| 1:01:30| And we really appreciate the Cerebral Palsy Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| They do really good work there. And they don't just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3694)|
| 1:01:38| take care of people who can't feed themselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| who can't walk, who can't change themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3702)|
| 1:01:46| Put yourself in their position. How would you like to be one of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3706)|
| 1:01:50| Put yourself in their shoes. And the work that they do there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3710)|
| 1:01:54| we're just one accident away, ourself, from one day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3714)|
| 1:01:58| being just like them. It could happen today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| What kind of services would you want?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| Would you want a group of people saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3726)|
| 1:02:10| no, we can't give you any money to take care of these people or take care of yourself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3730)|
| 1:02:15| And that's what it's coming down to. And maybe the Cerebral Palsy Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3735)|
| 1:02:19| won't be there one day to take care of you or your children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| or your grandchildren. So you really need to think about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3743)|
| 1:02:27| where your money goes, where my money goes. I work. I work two jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3747)|
| 1:02:31| And Billy works. You know, he don't just draw on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| disability. He works. He doesn't just sit at home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3755)|
| 1:02:39| So really, you know, these people really need the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| So that's all I have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3763)|
| 1:02:49| Thank you. Yes, sir, if you'd give us your name and address of the record as well, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3769)|
| 1:02:57| Steve Rose, 7827 McMillan Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3777)|
| 1:03:01| This is Amy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3781)|
| 1:03:05| We need Cerebral Palsy Center back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3785)|
| 1:03:09| Those people have given up salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| We've raised $80,000 in 90 days, and that's $4,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3793)|
| 1:03:17| I've been paying taxes on a lot of property a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3797)|
| 1:03:21| I want some of it back for her. I serve my country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3801)|
| 1:03:25| And now I'm serving her, and I want you all to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3805)|
| 1:03:29| If you've got a personal vendetta about the mayor doing this or that, take it up with the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| Don't take it out on my baby. She needs help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| Get these agendas straightened out and help the Cerebral Palsy Center because they help a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| That's the only thing she's got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3821)|
| 1:03:45| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| I wanted to thank you all very much for coming down, Mr. Sexton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3831)|
| 1:03:55| Thank you for making this presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3835)|
| 1:03:57| I want to take a little bit different twist on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3837)|
| 1:04:00| And I don't disagree with anything that Commissioner Broyles said at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3840)|
| 1:04:07| I mean, I think we have to respect the process on the community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3847)|
| 1:04:13| But this really falls outside the community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3853)|
| 1:04:17| In the past, we've had discretionary funds that the mayor has had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3857)|
| 1:04:22| It's been $20,000 in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3862)|
| 1:04:24| We've had as much as $6,000 for our commissioners, even when we had 19 commissioners and not just 11 that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3864)|
| 1:04:32| The mayor has given up his $20,000 that normally, if he wanted to, he could use these funds for something like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3872)|
| 1:04:41| Even though I agree completely with the community grants process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3881)|
| 1:04:46| and I appreciate very much the citizens that have given their times,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3886)|
| 1:04:50| is we have to recognize that the community grants process is not always perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3890)|
| 1:04:57| And we've heard right there where there was some misinterpretation of what was required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3897)|
| 1:05:02| by the Cerebral Palsy Organization when they put their application in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| One of the other things that we saw, I believe it was one or two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3906)|
| 1:05:11| and Commissioner Brown may remember this very well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3911)|
| 1:05:15| is Dr. Kim, who provides free medical services for our citizens who have no insurance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3915)|
| 1:05:22| and don't have the ability to pay, and he runs clinics over in South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| He came down for a presentation and scored very low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| and didn't receive any funds for his clinic that the county had supported in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| And part of the problem was that Dr. Kim is from Korea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| He came down here just as a citizen, did his own presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| His English is good, but it's not that good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3943)|
| 1:05:46| He didn't have a hired public relations firm to do the presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3946)|
| 1:05:50| And I'm not picking on any of the particular organizations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3950)|
| 1:05:53| but we have organizations like the Symphony Orchestra, the Opera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3953)|
| 1:05:57| and others who have professional grant writers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3957)|
| 1:06:00| They have professional PR firms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3960)|
| 1:06:02| They come down here with color charts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3962)|
| 1:06:05| They come down here with professionals that have filled out the applications exactly the way the law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3965)|
| 1:06:11| And they're going to score very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3971)|
| 1:06:14| And they should receive county funds for some of what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3974)|
| 1:06:19| But part of the reason that we had discretion funds in the past| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| and part of the reason why we still need to have some flexibility outside the straight community grants process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3982)|
| 1:06:29| is that the process isn't always perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3989)|
| 1:06:32| There's errors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| There's people that fall outside of what needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3993)|
| 1:06:37| We do have certain essential county services, like the Cerebral Palsy Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| And I don't know what the others receive, like Alzheimer's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4001)|
| 1:06:44| And there's these others that I don't care how conservative you are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4004)|
| 1:06:49| you would say that at the most lowest level, government has to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4009)|
| 1:06:57| And even our strictest citizens would agree that we have to help our citizens who can't help themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4017)|
| 1:07:04| And these are not voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4024)|
| 1:07:06| People don't, because they live wrong or do something wrong or make bad choices, don't have cerebral palsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4026)|
| 1:07:11| They don't have Alzheimer's disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| And they don't have some of these other processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| And for whatever reason, when they fall out because of a flawed process or even it just is outside the norm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4036)|
| 1:07:22| where we can give them the high enough ratings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4042)|
| 1:07:24| we need to have the flexibility in our government to be able to go back and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| we do need to help certain people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| And for that reason, rather than having some of these funds fall into the strict community grants process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4051)|
| 1:07:37| I think we do need to have the flexibility for the mayor and the county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4057)|
| 1:07:41| to go back and use their discretion that this is something that needs to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4061)|
| 1:07:46| We did it with Dr. Kim in the past, so he could keep his free clinic open for those that don't have health insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4066)|
| 1:07:52| I think we need to look at these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4072)|
| 1:07:53| And it's fine to look at these individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| But if there was an injustice done or the county needs to be doing something that we didn't do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| I think we need to have the flexibility and the opportunity to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4080)|
| 1:08:04| We have an individual here from ETTAC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4084)|
| 1:08:06| Would you like to address us, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4086)|
| 1:08:12| My name is Matthew Jones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4092)|
| 1:08:13| I'm from 116 Childress Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4093)|
| 1:08:17| I'm here to represent East Tennessee Technology Access Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4097)|
| 1:08:21| We're a local nonprofit that's been in business in the Knoxville community since 1988.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4101)|
| 1:08:28| We assist 24 counties in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| It's not just a Knoxville-based organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4111)|
| 1:08:35| I'm here today because of our reuse and reutilization program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4115)|
| 1:08:40| It's a program that has normally received funding from Knox County as well as the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4120)|
| 1:08:48| This year, our entire funding got cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4128)|
| 1:08:51| I understand the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4131)|
| 1:08:57| When I was a soldier in the United States military, I was a noncommissioned officer over 44 troops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| And when you have to give one of them a day off and you can't give all of them a day off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4142)|
| 1:09:06| it comes down to picking straws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| I'm sure that's what it came down to with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4149)|
| 1:09:13| All of us are deserving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| All of us need it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4155)|
| 1:09:18| They had a tough job to do, and they did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4158)|
| 1:09:22| That being said, we are here today asking for more money, asking for the additional $5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4162)|
| 1:09:31| As Mr. Hammond says, last year we took about $4,800.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4171)|
| 1:09:37| And through that, we supported $98,000 worth of equipment that helped 1,200 people in Knoxville alone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4177)|
| 1:09:46| With the $5,000, we're looking at doing the same thing this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4186)|
| 1:09:56| Last year, we had an 84% increase in services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4196)|
| 1:10:01| We did not ask for any extra money from any of our funding sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4201)|
| 1:10:06| We found a way to make every single dollar that we got the year before stretch to meet 84% increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4206)|
| 1:10:13| We tried to do the same thing this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| We're just falling short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4216)|
| 1:10:25| Our program is designed to help people that don't have insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4225)|
| 1:10:32| Our program is designed to help people whose insurance won't or can't pay for durable medical equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4232)|
| 1:10:41| Our program affects just about every citizen in Knoxville, whether you're one or 91.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4241)|
| 1:10:50| We have many partners, many organizations that assist us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4250)|
| 1:10:55| We've brought a couple sponsors with us today that would love to talk to you about what they do with some of our products.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4255)|
| 1:11:03| If you guys have a few minutes to listen, hear them out, we'd love to have them speak to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4263)|
| 1:11:09| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4269)|
| 1:11:13| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4273)|
| 1:11:14| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4274)|
| 1:11:15| Do we have other presenters that we're going to recognize out of the gathering today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4275)|
| 1:11:20| If there are other, would anyone else like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4280)|
| 1:11:22| Yes, would you like to come to the podium, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4282)|
| 1:11:29| Your name and address for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4289)|
| 1:11:31| My name is Pam Zachary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4291)|
| 1:11:33| I live at 548 Colonial Ridge Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37934.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| And I am a board member, the vice president of the board at the Sertana Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4298)|
| 1:11:45| But that is not the number one reason why I'm here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4305)|
| 1:11:54| That is the main reason that I'm also the grandmother and sister of an adult with developmental disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4314)|
| 1:12:05| Every one of these entities that are speaking today are all important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4325)|
| 1:12:09| We all fall under the same category of developmental disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4329)|
| 1:12:14| I don't like that term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4334)|
| 1:12:15| It's politically correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| But my sister's diagnosis says mentally retarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| And so does my granddaughter's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4341)|
| 1:12:25| They cannot speak for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4345)|
| 1:12:28| I understand, as the gentleman spoke before me, both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4348)|
| 1:12:33| But this is not about work that is done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4353)|
| 1:12:35| This is not about a cause we're asking you to buy into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4355)|
| 1:12:39| This is reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4359)|
| 1:12:41| Every day, children are born in this world that have some form of brain damage, health damage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4361)|
| 1:12:49| and they are born automatically with the need for financial help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4369)|
| 1:12:54| School gives them somewhat of it until they're 22 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4374)|
| 1:12:58| When they turn 22 years old, it's over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4378)|
| 1:13:01| There is nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4381)|
| 1:13:03| The Sotoma Center provides services for adults with developmental disabilities over the age of 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4383)|
| 1:13:12| As you all know, the Baby Boomers are a large portion of our population who are beginning to age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4392)|
| 1:13:18| Over 50% of the 102 adults that we service are over 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4398)|
| 1:13:24| Multiple, multiple health problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4404)|
| 1:13:27| You cannot imagine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| The funds are being cut for that continually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4410)|
| 1:13:35| What we are asking for is a request to fund our medical and wellness program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4415)|
| 1:13:43| which is an essential service for medical care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| It's not something that's going to go away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4426)|
| 1:13:49| It's always going to be with us because people with developmental disabilities are born every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4429)|
| 1:13:54| And now the significant number of that population is aging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4434)|
| 1:13:58| No one has got to take care of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4438)|
| 1:14:01| My father is fighting abdominal cancer, and my mother has heart disease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4441)|
| 1:14:04| She's 70 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4444)|
| 1:14:06| My sister's 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| She has lupus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4447)|
| 1:14:08| They cannot physically take care of her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4448)|
| 1:14:11| They need help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4451)|
| 1:14:12| They're retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4452)|
| 1:14:14| Among all these other people with the cerebral palsy, Alzheimer's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4454)|
| 1:14:17| we all fall in the same category of developmental disabilities, and we need your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4457)|
| 1:14:23| Mr. Thomas Center also has 23 homes where we take care of individuals whose families have no money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4463)|
| 1:14:32| whose families have abandoned them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4472)|
| 1:14:35| and they depend on these funds to just live their normal lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| They can't give themselves shots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4479)|
| 1:14:41| They can't go to the bathroom by themselves, some of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| They can't take their own blood pressure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| We have to give them 24-hour service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| So I understand the need for the Citizens Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| I understand all that because that's a process that you have to go through, and I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4492)|
| 1:14:57| I truly do, as we all do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| But the reality is the needs of these people is right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4500)|
| 1:15:04| We cannot wait another six weeks, 12 weeks, 10 months to get the funding that we need to continue this care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4504)|
| 1:15:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4513)|
| 1:15:16| Mr. Wright, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4516)|
| 1:15:17| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4517)|
| 1:15:20| When you introduced this resolution, you spoke to some specific organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4520)|
| 1:15:27| Are those organizations among these five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| I didn't catch that as we started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| Yes, the Cerebral Palsy, the ETTAC, Sertoma Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| I believe there are a couple of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4538)|
| 1:15:39| Dengue Law and Alzheimer's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| Dengue Law and Alzheimer's, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4541)|
| 1:15:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| There are a total of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| The comment that I wanted to make was it centers around what process are we at today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4545)|
| 1:15:55| We've talked about community grants on some level for some several minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4555)|
| 1:16:01| I would offer to you that the community grants bucket is gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| The community grants budget came from community grants, and it was paid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4566)|
| 1:16:13| What we have before us right at the moment is something completely different in that it is citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4573)|
| 1:16:19| The citizen review panel is not involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4579)|
| 1:16:22| It is the mayoral office looking to make contract services available to the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4582)|
| 1:16:32| I view this as standing there with several hundred thousand dollars more than what we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| the $41,000 that we've talked about since 222.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4598)|
| 1:16:45| And I would look for us to be closing in on the fact that we either need to take this and vote up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4605)|
| 1:16:53| And I am in favor of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4613)|
| 1:16:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4615)|
| 1:16:57| Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4619)|
| 1:17:03| I just want to say that my uncle goes to Sotoma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| He has Down syndrome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4628)|
| 1:17:10| He is 50-plus years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4630)|
| 1:17:12| I'm not going to give his age because he'll be mad at me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| They do wonderful work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4636)|
| 1:17:19| And if government's only job is to take care of the ones that can't take care of themselves, it's, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4639)|
| 1:17:31| I'm not in favor of every nonprofit receiving money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4651)|
| 1:17:34| I'm not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4654)|
| 1:17:35| I'm just we can't physically do that financially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| We just can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4658)|
| 1:17:40| But ones like the Cerebral Palsy, the Sotoma, and these other organizations, they do need our help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4660)|
| 1:17:50| And these are individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| And I know from my uncle, luckily, he has family that does help take care of him| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4672)|
| 1:17:58| and does make sure that he has what he needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4678)|
| 1:18:02| He has been in some of these group homes at Sotoma, which are wonderful places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4682)|
| 1:18:08| And they do wonderful work there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| But there is a lot, like she said, that citizens of our community that are in these homes that families don't visit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4690)|
| 1:18:21| Families don't come and see them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| They don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4705)|
| 1:18:26| I'm not going to say they don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4706)|
| 1:18:28| But they don't know if they're getting fed or clothed or anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4708)|
| 1:18:33| But I think these organizations are wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4713)|
| 1:18:37| And I agree with Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| This is a totally separate issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| This is a contract that we're signing with these organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4721)|
| 1:18:48| It's not they're providing a service for our citizens that live in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4728)|
| 1:18:54| And we need to support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4734)|
| 1:18:56| It has nothing to do with the grant process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4736)|
| 1:18:58| They went through the grant process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| They weren't given the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| But this is a contract that we're going to agree to, or I am,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4742)|
| 1:19:07| is going to agree to go into a contract with these organizations to help take care of our citizens of this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4747)|
| 1:19:15| that do get out and do need to be respected and do need to be taken care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4755)|
| 1:19:23| So I will be supporting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4763)|
| 1:19:25| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4765)|
| 1:19:27| No, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| I like how this conversation has evolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4773)|
| 1:19:36| I really do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4776)|
| 1:19:37| And I applaud the mayor and several commissioners because this is the right thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4777)|
| 1:19:43| These are great organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| These organizations did apply through community grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4785)|
| 1:19:48| But, you know, during the budget process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4788)|
| 1:19:50| all I heard was we need to start building roads and educating people and nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| And so I like that things have shifted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4794)|
| 1:19:58| And I support giving more to these type organizations than we're giving now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4798)|
| 1:20:06| I like the 2008, 2009 levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4806)|
| 1:20:09| Those are appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4809)|
| 1:20:10| Like the gentleman, Mr. Sexton, said, an 83% cut is extreme.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4810)|
| 1:20:16| They need more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4816)|
| 1:20:17| So I really hope we'll all be here next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| I hope we all, the mayor's office, commission, listen to what these people are saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4820)|
| 1:20:25| And with that said, I'm challenging you all to come back during the budget process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4825)|
| 1:20:31| You all were really quiet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| And I need your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| When the numbers aren't what you think are fair, please come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4836)|
| 1:20:41| When something structurally was wrong, and that sounds, that makes perfect sense to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4841)|
| 1:20:47| because I've heard it from another organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4847)|
| 1:20:51| Show up, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4851)|
| 1:20:52| Call us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4852)|
| 1:20:53| Talk about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4853)|
| 1:20:54| You know, and that is what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| We need to be having dialogues about people that are, through no fault of their own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4857)|
| 1:21:03| were just born to be less fortunate than we are in terms of providing for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4863)|
| 1:21:09| These are great organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4869)|
| 1:21:11| So, you know, I really do appreciate this level of conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4871)|
| 1:21:15| And then, you know, with my analytical political hat on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4875)|
| 1:21:21| I do appreciate Mr. Sexton pointing out what I consider a pretty major flaw in the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4881)|
| 1:21:30| And, again, that was pointed out by, this was an arts organization, a similar thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4890)|
| 1:21:36| saying that, you know, that this was a marching orders and something got mixed up in the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4896)|
| 1:21:41| This was a couple of years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| So, thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4903)|
| 1:21:44| Thank you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| And I hope next year we'll have these same conversations, these same conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4906)|
| 1:21:53| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| I really appreciate us talking about some of the softer side of the budget, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4915)|
| 1:22:01| not the roads and the grounds and the facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4921)|
| 1:22:03| Some of these things that I feel the county should be doing, like these organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4923)|
| 1:22:07| Commissioner Brawls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4929)|
| 1:22:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| Mr. Sexton, we had talked about what had happened during the citizen review panel process and grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4931)|
| 1:22:19| I had gone and spoken with Grant about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4939)|
| 1:22:22| And you had run the numbers a couple of times, different ways on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4942)|
| 1:22:29| And what was your take on how that would have worked out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4949)|
| 1:22:35| I mean, I think it hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| I think it hurt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4957)|
| 1:22:38| Mr. Chairman, it's been pointed out the grant process is not under review here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4958)|
| 1:22:43| We're voting on these defined service contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4963)|
| 1:22:45| I'd like to call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4965)|
| 1:22:48| Commissioner Brawls had the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| Mr. Law Director, does she need to finish before?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4969)|
| 1:22:55| He'll need the floor before he can call for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4975)|
| 1:22:57| So, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4978)|
| 1:23:01| Actually, I don't agree with the supposition that the grants process has nothing to do with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4981)|
| 1:23:07| These organizations came and asked for money through our community grants process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| They weren't awarded money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4992)|
| 1:23:13| The only way to give them money now is to do it by this defined services contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4993)|
| 1:23:18| And I'd also like to say that for the last two years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| I have encouraged us to move away from the grants process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| and do it all through defined service contracts with these organizations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| because they do provide a very serious and much-needed service to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5010)|
| 1:23:39| If we have no safe place to take our adults with developmental disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5019)|
| 1:23:46| or our children who have aged out of the school system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5026)|
| 1:23:50| then their caregivers can't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5030)|
| 1:23:54| We lose their productivity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5034)|
| 1:24:00| So having defined services contracts with these organizations, in my opinion, in the long run,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| saves us tax dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5045)|
| 1:24:08| Now, I don't think there's anybody up here who doesn't want these groups to get money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5048)|
| 1:24:13| And during the budget process, there was no one working harder than myself to restore some funding to these non-profits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5053)|
| 1:24:24| You know, the mayor chose to cut the budget severely in that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5064)|
| 1:24:31| And I'm glad, like Sam, I'm glad to hear that everybody is so in favor of funding these organizations now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5071)|
| 1:24:38| because you weren't a couple months ago when all we heard was cut, cut, cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5078)|
| 1:24:44| So I don't just want to give money to these organizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5084)|
| 1:24:50| We need to find the money to give to other organizations that were also ranked as being important to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5090)|
| 1:24:59| So, again, I'm glad to see that the mayor agrees with us now on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5099)|
| 1:25:06| that these are important and worthwhile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5106)|
| 1:25:08| I'm glad that we have some money to appropriate, but it's not enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5108)|
| 1:25:15| It's not nearly enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| And, no, our grant process is not perfect, which is why the defined services contract, in my opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5118)|
| 1:25:24| is where we need to be headed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5124)|
| 1:25:26| And I think that the administration is in agreement on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5126)|
| 1:25:30| So I hope that we'll see that bear some fruit next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5130)|

| 1:29:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5398)|
| 1:29:59| Does the phrase may pay need to be in this resolution somewhere, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5399)|
| 1:30:08| It is discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5408)|
| 1:30:09| But this, when I read this, though, it doesn't say may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5409)|
| 1:30:15| It says there are two provide for, which means I've got to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5415)|
| 1:30:19| The caption doesn't say may, but it's in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5419)|
| 1:30:21| In the ordinance itself, it's purely discretionary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5421)|
| 1:30:23| I'll be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5423)|

| 1:30:30| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5430)|
| 1:30:36| The discussion item on the rules of procedure has been deferred for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5436)|
| 1:30:40| Commissioner Norman had asked that a discussion item be added with regards to the Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5440)|
| 1:30:44| So, Commissioner Norman or Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| Well, I wanted to comment on the heels of this, but with it being deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5447)|
| 1:30:52| So, I'd like to make a statement about kind of commission processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| Maybe it's a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| We can talk about it now or later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5458)|
| 1:30:59| Let's go ahead and get yours, and then we'll go to Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5459)|
| 1:31:02| And it really just kind of bothers me, especially what I sincerely appreciate Commissioner Owen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5462)|
| 1:31:09| being his words at the beginning of the meeting, because, you know, he and I agree on a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5469)|
| 1:31:15| because we all have a lot of unanimous votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| But, you know, on some contentious issues, a lot of times we're on opposite sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| But, you know, I think we do a great job of respecting each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5481)|
| 1:31:26| And I guess the question is, and maybe it's just a decorum question, but just now, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5486)|
| 1:31:33| I think Commissioner Burroughs was interrupted in the mid-sentence and given something that was given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5493)|
| 1:31:40| and blurted out that was out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5500)|
| 1:31:43| I think we said it was out of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5503)|
| 1:31:45| So, I guess for the law director, how can we deal with that from a commission processes point of view standpoint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5505)|
| 1:31:54| We just, in my opinion, we just can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| And this happened a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| We really need to get our arms around this to help us, help facilitate us, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5517)|
| 1:32:03| kind of, as Commissioner Norman said, start, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5523)|
| 1:32:06| treating each other with a little more decorum and respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5526)|
| 1:32:10| Well, really, Commissioner, it comes down to whether you want to try to legislate civility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5530)|
| 1:32:14| and actually put it in your commission rules or on the alternative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5534)|
| 1:32:18| just presume to think that that's something you'll agree upon as a body just not to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5538)|
| 1:32:24| I am rewriting your rules to make them simplified and wean us off the 700-page Roberts rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5544)|
| 1:32:30| But, really, that's what it boils down to, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5550)|
| 1:32:36| Commissioner Norman, you want to, the discussion item that you had put on the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5556)|
| 1:32:41| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| I didn't see your note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5562)|
| 1:32:43| I'm sorry, Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5563)|
| 1:32:44| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| I want to reply to what Commissioner McKenzie just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5565)|
| 1:32:51| The reason I did it and the reason I do it is because I try to follow what the commission rules say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5571)|
| 1:32:58| When you're speaking, you don't keep reiterating the same information over and over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5578)|
| 1:33:03| and watch the time limits and saying the same thing that somebody else said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5583)|
| 1:33:09| That's what I object to because I feel like that's a waste of my time because I heard it the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5589)|
| 1:33:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5597)|
| 1:33:20| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| My request that this be a discussion item is just in due of the fact that I think that this is quite a big,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5603)|
| 1:33:36| obviously, a very big topic for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5616)|
| 1:33:40| And there's a number of issues that have sprung up and probably will be discussed and written about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5620)|
| 1:33:50| But I just thought, just for the health of the body of our ability to talk to each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5630)|
| 1:33:57| since we don't get to talk to each other, and this is a topic that needs to be talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5637)|
| 1:34:05| So I'm just hoping that, I mean, I have lots of questions like, what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5645)|
| 1:34:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5653)|
| 1:34:14| What happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5654)|
| 1:34:15| How did this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5655)|
| 1:34:18| We were in a discussion about some questions about process in terms of RFP and so on and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5658)|
| 1:34:32| And suddenly the bond group wants no part of us and no part of this activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5672)|
| 1:34:42| So it just brings up a lot of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5682)|
| 1:34:44| I have questions, of course, about the school board, the activity of the superintendent, his position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5684)|
| 1:34:52| his stated position, and then his influence on the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5692)|
| 1:34:58| which resulted in them flipping their position for, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| four meetings of discussions with us and ardent just absolutely without any doubt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5703)|
| 1:35:19| requesting renovation for Carr School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5719)|
| 1:35:22| So these are all things that are just very curious to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| I'm not confused by all these events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| And so I'm just wondering if, for my sake or for others, if anybody else would have a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5729)|
| 1:35:36| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| This really has to do some with what Tony said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5738)|
| 1:35:42| And I know we have both the superintendent of schools and the chairman of the school board down there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5742)|
| 1:35:48| who came to our meeting today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| I think a lot of what this commission heard was even quoting me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5751)|
| 1:35:55| And it makes me a little nervous to say what I thought other people were saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5755)|
| 1:35:59| and what I thought they were thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5759)|
| 1:36:02| And I think it would probably be since we don't have any agenda on the item regarding the schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5762)|
| 1:36:10| is even to see if the superintendent or the chairman of the school board would like to address the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5770)|
| 1:36:15| Mr. Chairman, this is not on our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5775)|
| 1:36:19| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5779)|
| 1:36:20| What is before us right now is discussion of the members of commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5780)|
| 1:36:24| And I would like to refrain it, keep it refrained to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5784)|
| 1:36:32| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5792)|
| 1:36:33| Is that with the discussion item, can we bring up folks who aren't part of this 11 to discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5793)|
| 1:36:41| or help facilitate our discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| I know, difficult question, Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| I'll pay you the big bucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5806)|
| 1:36:47| I'd be glad not to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| I think for the Law Director, it's a question for the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5808)|
| 1:36:51| I'm going to ask the Law Director for his answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5811)|
| 1:36:57| I mean, you have a discussion item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5817)|
| 1:36:59| The discussion item is to discuss the Massa Nations, what led to the withdrawal of the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5819)|
| 1:37:05| In terms of what's appropriate, you know, realistically, commissioners, this is your discussion item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5825)|
| 1:37:11| and what you feel is appropriate if you feel is germane to the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5831)|
| 1:37:14| If you start bringing in extraneous information that has nothing to do with the subject at hand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5834)|
| 1:37:19| then you're probably going too far afield and the chairman may want to exercise parliamentary procedure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5839)|
| 1:37:24| But is this facilitating the argument?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5844)|
| 1:37:27| If the chairman feels it's not, if it's too far afield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5847)|
| 1:37:30| then you should probably try to restrict your comments to the subject at hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5850)|
| 1:37:34| But, I mean, I can't quote you anything in Robert's rules or your commission rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5854)|
| 1:37:40| because they definitively box this in and give you a definitive answer beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5860)|
| 1:37:46| So, Commissioner Briggs, what is your?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5866)|
| 1:37:48| Well, I didn't mean to cause a lot of trouble, I'll tell you that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5868)|
| 1:37:51| I mean, we're just trying to get some answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5871)|
| 1:37:54| And I can give what I think somebody was saying or what I think somebody was thinking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5874)|
| 1:37:58| or what I think someone meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5878)|
| 1:38:00| But would it not be better to hear it from them rather than hearing from what I think they said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| I think it's really premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| I mean, this is so sudden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5886)|
| 1:38:07| I don't think they know where they're at at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5887)|
| 1:38:09| And I think I would like to know, all of us would like to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5889)|
| 1:38:11| but I think we're premature in asking for something right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5891)|
| 1:38:15| until they come up with some answers and some other directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| Well, I don't know how to find out unless we ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5898)|
| 1:38:20| Well, but I don't think they're ready yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| That's my point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5902)|
| 1:38:23| Well, maybe they'd like to speak for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5903)|
| 1:38:25| I mean, you think that and I think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| Well, if you all don't know what you know yet or what you want to think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5909)|
| 1:38:33| I think that's fine if we're not going to allow you to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5913)|
| 1:38:36| So I'll just turn my light off then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5916)|
| 1:38:38| But I think here where, you know, where we're saying they don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5918)|
| 1:38:43| and I'm saying I think what they think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5923)|
| 1:38:45| I think maybe they should have the opportunity to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5925)|
| 1:38:49| But I'll not request that they speak if that's not permitted and that's fine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5929)|
| 1:38:53| because I didn't mean to stir it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5933)|
| 1:38:55| I'm just trying to get the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5935)|
| 1:38:57| Let's right now keep it to our commissioners and we'll see where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5937)|
| 1:39:00| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5940)|
| 1:39:01| Yeah, I'd, you know, my issue with Carter was the funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5941)|
| 1:39:06| and we've worked, had meetings in regard to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5946)|
| 1:39:10| What I would like to do is this could be one of those issues that cooler heads prevail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5950)|
| 1:39:18| and I think it would be best that we let some people, the involved parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| the school board, the superintendent and the mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5962)|
| 1:39:26| I think it's good for them to speak to each other, have communications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| and let the school board have an open meeting about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| before we interject our opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5971)|
| 1:39:36| I just, ultimately, it's their decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5976)|
| 1:39:39| and I would love to build a new Carter school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| and we've got to look at the legalities of the bid process again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5981)|
| 1:39:45| Do you re-bid?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| What do you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5986)|
| 1:39:47| And so I think it would be better if we let the affected parties sit down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5987)|
| 1:39:54| and have conversation before we make a big public issue of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5994)|
| 1:39:57| That's just my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5997)|
| 1:39:59| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=5999)|
| 1:40:04| Ultimately, it is the school board's decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6004)|
| 1:40:06| but that's one of our main problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6006)|
| 1:40:09| It was their decision and they changed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| And so that was one of the reasons why I brought this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6012)|
| 1:40:17| was I would like to know why they changed positions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6017)|
| 1:40:22| why the superintendent chose to reverse his position about renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6022)|
| 1:40:29| But we'll find that out, I guess, eventually at a school board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6029)|
| 1:40:36| if not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| If the body does not wish to ask the superintendent to come forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| I certainly won't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6041)|
| 1:40:42| But it is germane to the issue, the Devon group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6042)|
| 1:40:48| and an explanation from some reasoning for why they would suddenly drop out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6048)|
| 1:40:54| just on the basis of the questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| the fairly simple and straightforward questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| that we ask during the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| I don't understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| There's much more to this story than what we see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6063)|
| 1:41:08| Now, I don't want to interfere with further process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6068)|
| 1:41:13| in terms of the Carter school, its renovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6073)|
| 1:41:15| or it's the new school, whichever it turns out to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6075)|
| 1:41:19| I don't want to interfere with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| But I do think that there's quite an airing out that needs to be had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| and I don't see why we're reluctant to do that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6084)|
| 1:41:31| Commissioner Ollenby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6091)|
| 1:41:35| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6095)|
| 1:41:36| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6096)|
| 1:41:37| I don't mind having the discussion between us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6097)|
| 1:41:39| because we don't get to sit down and discuss this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6099)|
| 1:41:43| I believe that we've discussed Carter Elementary until I'm blue in the face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6103)|
| 1:41:49| I mean, everybody knows where everybody stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6109)|
| 1:41:51| I know where I stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| Now, while the superintendent changed his decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6113)|
| 1:41:59| we change our decisions up here all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| We decide one way and then the next time we vote a different way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6122)|
| 1:42:08| This commission actually voted to send it back there to try to find the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6128)|
| 1:42:15| And then I thought when it came back here next Monday, there'd be very little discussion, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6135)|
| 1:42:21| But it turned into a two-hour and 20-minute discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6141)|
| 1:42:25| on whether Devon Group should have had to bid, not had to bid, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6145)|
| 1:42:32| I'm not going to get into all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6152)|
| 1:42:34| The thing is, is people change their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6154)|
| 1:42:36| And if I want to know what Dr. McIntyre is thinking or why he changed his mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6156)|
| 1:42:42| or Chairwoman Kincannon, I'll go up and ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6162)|
| 1:42:46| I can free to meet with them any time without open meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6166)|
| 1:42:50| I mean, I don't have to send out a request that I'm going to talk to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6170)|
| 1:42:53| The thing is, is this needs to stay here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6173)|
| 1:42:56| I don't know why we're discussing it because it's irrelevant why Devon Group pulled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6176)|
| 1:43:01| They pulled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6181)|
| 1:43:02| It's their choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6182)|
| 1:43:04| They chose to back out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6184)|
| 1:43:05| And if anybody wants to know why they backed out, I'd say just call them up and ask them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6185)|
| 1:43:10| Because it has nothing to do with what's on the table here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6190)|
| 1:43:14| Now, I mean, we can discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| But I think it's just prolonging something that we don't really need to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6196)|
| 1:43:24| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6204)|
| 1:43:28| I consider Knox County Commission as one of the relevant groups in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6208)|
| 1:43:33| one of the relevant parties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| because we are the ones who are going to have to come up with the funding for this school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6214)|
| 1:43:40| And we've been trying to stick our thumb in school board's pie for the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6220)|
| 1:43:46| So I don't understand the sudden reluctance to engage them in conversation about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6226)|
| 1:43:56| I'm sure that they know what they think about this and where they prefer to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6236)|
| 1:44:02| And I know that they do because I've already spoken to India about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6242)|
| 1:44:05| And I'll be happy to call Dr. McIntyre and speak to him in person about it also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6245)|
| 1:44:13| But if something did go wrong with the Devon Group pulling out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6253)|
| 1:44:19| then I think it is a good idea for us to discuss it so that if there is a mistake made somewhere, we don't make it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6259)|
| 1:44:29| So I don't have a problem with discussing why they pulled out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| I don't have a problem with asking India and Dr. McIntyre what they think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6272)|
| 1:44:40| And I don't understand why we're tiptoeing around this all of a sudden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6280)|
| 1:44:48| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| I guess I just, if there is a notion that it's not our business, then we should have answered that one three years ago when we started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6292)|
| 1:45:07| You know, it's our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6307)|
| 1:45:10| We interjected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6310)|
| 1:45:12| You know, a bit of a history lesson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6312)|
| 1:45:15| We, because we could not take and dissect the capital budget process, we chose not to fund it for reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6315)|
| 1:45:30| We gave those reasons, but we couldn't officially give those reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6330)|
| 1:45:33| And we sent them back to the drawing board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6333)|
| 1:45:35| And they've been at that drawing board for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6335)|
| 1:45:39| But we've been involved in this thing since it was presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6339)|
| 1:45:45| Not day one, but since the final, what they thought was their final product was presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6345)|
| 1:45:51| Their high needs capital improvement plan was presented to us quite some time ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6351)|
| 1:45:57| And we got involved, which is, you know, unprecedented since the consent decree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6357)|
| 1:46:05| or the agreed order that, you know, told us to stay out of school board business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6365)|
| 1:46:11| And we agreed to stay out of school board business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6371)|
| 1:46:14| So we kind of got around that process and started, you know, this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6374)|
| 1:46:22| So to come August 2011 and say, no, we need to, you know, not give them a chance to get their ducks in a row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6382)|
| 1:46:32| that's not the way we've operated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6392)|
| 1:46:34| It has not been our history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| So I guess since we can't bring people up, one of my issues, I guess, like you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6396)|
| 1:46:41| we can't do a lot of talking amongst each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6401)|
| 1:46:44| But just to let folks know, one of my issues is I think Commissioner Norman asked a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6404)|
| 1:46:52| Let me put a footnote here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6412)|
| 1:46:54| I didn't think we beat up the Devon group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6414)|
| 1:46:58| I don't remember that conversation happening last Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6418)|
| 1:47:01| But that's just me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6421)|
| 1:47:03| I may have stepped out of the room and missed a bunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6423)|
| 1:47:05| But I don't remember that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6425)|
| 1:47:08| With that said, I think Commissioner Norman started asking questions about the bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6428)|
| 1:47:15| And one of my things, and Commissioner Andrews brought it up as well, which is a good point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6435)|
| 1:47:20| is that I don't know if the bids are still sealed because I know the original RFP was for a lease buyback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6440)|
| 1:47:32| That's what I thought, a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6452)|
| 1:47:34| I thought that's what the school board said, that this was more of a lease buyback process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6454)|
| 1:47:39| which is not what came out the pipe at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| The pipe was paying two years, but it was more conventional than the lease buyback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6463)|
| 1:47:51| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6471)|
| 1:47:52| Again, there's probably all kinds of proprietary stuff out there in that bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6472)|
| 1:47:57| If those records have opened up, those are some of the questions I think we need to start getting into to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6477)|
| 1:48:06| especially, you know, if we're going to continue this intrusion, I think, into school board business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6486)|
| 1:48:15| Those are some of the things that I think we need to ask because, ultimately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6495)|
| 1:48:19| we're the stewards of the taxpayers' dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6499)|
| 1:48:24| And these are very important decisions that we're going to be making and that will have far-reaching consequences| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6504)|
| 1:48:33| because, as you know, regardless however you build a school, there's long-term implications from a funding standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6513)|
| 1:48:42| Either we're paying zero interest on our bonds or we're paying bonds more traditionally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6522)|
| 1:48:51| or, you know, we're going to do this, we'll pay you in two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| So either way, I would like to somehow get involved in that conversation at some point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6534)|
| 1:49:03| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6543)|
| 1:49:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6544)|
| 1:49:05| Several words here that I need to go back and revisit for just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6545)|
| 1:49:08| One is reluctance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6548)|
| 1:49:10| I'm not reluctant to talk about anything Dr. Briggs and I talked about this morning at 8 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6550)|
| 1:49:17| During a duly noticed public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6557)|
| 1:49:20| With two TV cameras present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6560)|
| 1:49:24| In fact, I think some of that played on the noonday lunch news.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6564)|
| 1:49:27| I hope it didn't upset too many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6567)|
| 1:49:29| I mean, as far as being able to eat lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6569)|
| 1:49:33| So I'm not reluctant to talk to anyone, not reluctant to have any discussion here at this table today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6573)|
| 1:49:39| Second thing that was brought up was tiptoe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6579)|
| 1:49:41| Not tiptoeing around anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6581)|
| 1:49:42| In fact, if anyone wants to know how I feel, stand back and let me tell you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6582)|
| 1:49:49| It's not our business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6589)|
| 1:49:51| Or stay out of their business was in the consent decree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6591)|
| 1:49:55| Well, I got it out of my hip pocket and I can't find those words in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6595)|
| 1:50:00| We're not directed by this consent decree that was signed between the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6600)|
| 1:50:08| and Commission to stay out of any of their business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6608)|
| 1:50:11| We are restricted from doing some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6611)|
| 1:50:16| But when it comes to the capital dollars of Knox County spent by the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6616)|
| 1:50:22| We at least get to talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| I think what some people are sitting here today saying is we shouldn't even question them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6625)|
| 1:50:30| It's the citizens of Knox County's dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6630)|
| 1:50:34| It flows through us and it's to give equal education as distributed by the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6634)|
| 1:50:41| to all the students in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6641)|
| 1:50:44| I have attended school board meetings since before the current school board was seated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6644)|
| 1:50:49| I know how they talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6649)|
| 1:50:50| I know how they think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6650)|
| 1:50:51| I try to understand what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6651)|
| 1:50:53| If you'll remember over the last 12 months, I've even spoken to some of their things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6653)|
| 1:50:57| which were probably kind of fuzzy to what I think my thinking was here on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6657)|
| 1:51:02| and said I support that and try to amplify what's taking place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6662)|
| 1:51:07| But as this one particular situation has boiled down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6667)|
| 1:51:13| and we've been somehow arrived at this location with so many flat tires,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6673)|
| 1:51:21| just in the last day or two to stand today and decide that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6681)|
| 1:51:27| well, let's not look at what we've done for the last 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6687)|
| 1:51:31| Let's look at what we can do today and pass something today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6691)|
| 1:51:35| I don't see how that gets before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6695)|
| 1:51:39| I just literally cannot understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6699)|
| 1:51:42| Now, this may seal the fate of Carter Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6702)|
| 1:51:49| It may be a $2 million renovation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6709)|
| 1:51:54| I need to pause for just a second and say I went to a renovation of the STEM school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6714)|
| 1:51:59| a couple of weeks ago, nice place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6719)|
| 1:52:02| But really what I want to talk about is Ball Camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| I went to Ball Camp a couple of weeks ago whenever the renovation was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6725)|
| 1:52:10| The ribbon-cutting took place there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| If the renovation at Carter Elementary will look like Ball Camp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6733)|
| 1:52:18| it needs to start tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6738)|
| 1:52:20| But I don't see how the millions of dollars that were spent in one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6740)|
| 1:52:23| can equal the millions of dollars that's going to be spent in the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| The starting places are different and the schools start out different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6747)|
| 1:52:31| And the end result that's being proposed for Carter Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| is not the end result that has been delivered at Ball Camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6754)|
| 1:52:40| That needs to be discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6760)|
| 1:52:42| I don't think it can be discussed in 48 hours and us come up with a situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6762)|
| 1:52:46| a solution to the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6766)|
| 1:52:49| I just don't see how we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6769)|
| 1:52:51| That's why the resolutions that were before us were not before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6771)|
| 1:52:58| But that's also why the discussion item that we have right now is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6778)|
| 1:53:04| I need input on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| Why people think it is that this is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6786)|
| 1:53:11| Where we're at today, all these wheels running off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6791)|
| 1:53:17| and Carter Elementary is going to be okay with something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6797)|
| 1:53:20| that has been known for the last 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6800)|
| 1:53:23| I oppose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6803)|
| 1:53:26| The administration of the county has not had an opportunity to look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6806)|
| 1:53:29| and determine where we may go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6809)|
| 1:53:34| From what I'm hearing right now, it may be that the school board, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| the Board of Education may have already made their decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6817)|
| 1:53:41| And I'm just amazed that that might have taken place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6821)|
| 1:53:49| Someone said, we don't talk to each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6829)|
| 1:53:53| I don't talk to any of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6833)|
| 1:53:58| I say that tongue-in-cheek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| I appreciate the friendship of every person that sits around this table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6841)|
| 1:54:06| Because in three years, I view it as being a friendship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6846)|
| 1:54:10| But if you can allow me for one moment to have my underwear in a wad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6850)|
| 1:54:16| what's happened since Thursday ties up the whole drawer full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6856)|
| 1:54:22| And I don't see how it's going to be settled since yesterday afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6862)|
| 1:54:26| or the piece of paper being thrown in front of us this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6866)|
| 1:54:30| Now, if I'm wrong in that, you can talk to me about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6870)|
| 1:54:35| But if we can take a moment and look at what might be the alternatives to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6875)|
| 1:54:41| let me give you a short story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6881)|
| 1:54:44| Commissioner Broyles and this other commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6884)|
| 1:54:49| that wants to sit out in Hamlin County down here on the far end of the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6889)|
| 1:54:55| We're on the audit committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| We've put out an RFP to audit the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6897)|
| 1:55:00| Nine people show up and throw in a piece of paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6900)|
| 1:55:02| Some of them fall out almost immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| I think it's down to five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6905)|
| 1:55:08| Sometime next month, we may get it down to three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| Until a contract is signed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6911)|
| 1:55:16| we don't know if we're going to get somebody to audit the county or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6916)|
| 1:55:19| When that number one person that we pick says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6919)|
| 1:55:22| nope, I can't audit the county, does that mean we forego an audit of the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6922)|
| 1:55:27| No, it means we go do something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6927)|
| 1:55:30| The same thing is true with Carter Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6930)|
| 1:55:33| If we have after several months, and really I need to say if after several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6933)|
| 1:55:39| we've arrived at a point where we think it possible that the kids at Carter Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6939)|
| 1:55:45| have a new school, then I want them to have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6945)|
| 1:55:49| I don't want it to run off at the last moment in a technicality| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6949)|
| 1:55:53| with people pointing fingers at each other and that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| Well, it happened at the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6957)|
| 1:55:59| No, it happened at the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6959)|
| 1:56:01| No, it happened in the executive office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6961)|
| 1:56:03| No, it happened at county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6963)|
| 1:56:07| We have to face up to the fact that the buck stops here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| We're the ones that were going to come up with the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| The mayor can want to sell everything in Knox County all day long,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| and until we decide what's going to be sold or where the money's going to come from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6974)|
| 1:56:19| Carter Elementary will not get a school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| If we can't come up with the money, if we can't come up with the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6982)|
| 1:56:27| saying they need a new school all day long doesn't amount to a clump of watermelons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6987)|
| 1:56:34| or a clump of whatever it is that we grow out there on Carter School Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=6994)|
| 1:56:42| Now, having said all this, Tony, I appreciate Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7002)|
| 1:56:47| I appreciate you wanting us to have a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7007)|
| 1:56:49| If you remember way back when, I didn't oppose a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7009)|
| 1:56:53| I just wanted it to be a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7013)|
| 1:56:55| And, really, what you've done has been a service to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7015)|
| 1:57:01| My blood pressure is probably down just a little bit right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7021)|
| 1:57:05| and I like the situation of things moving slowly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7025)|
| 1:57:12| and if there is some alternative to what needs to be done in the next 30 to 45 days, it can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7032)|
| 1:57:20| It can be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| Carter Elementary can still have a new school in 2013, or 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7041)|
| 1:57:28| whatever you call out that date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7048)|
| 1:57:32| But it's not really up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7052)|
| 1:57:36| It's back to the administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7056)|
| 1:57:44| It's back to the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7064)|
| 1:57:48| It's back to the legal opinions or legal whatevers of contracts that are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7068)|
| 1:57:57| I've got lots of things that I think could happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7077)|
| 1:58:00| but I'll do like Commissioner Ornby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7080)|
| 1:58:03| If I need to say something to someone about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7083)|
| 1:58:09| just as Commissioner Briggs and I have talked about it earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7089)|
| 1:58:12| if I need to talk to someone about it, I think I can go do that on my own.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7092)|
| 1:58:16| And if you think the people at Carter Elementary need a new school, you need to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7096)|
| 1:58:24| If you think that the kids at Carter Elementary can do with a $2 million and I say coat of paint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7104)|
| 1:58:33| that will be okay because it is commissioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7113)|
| 1:58:36| It's going to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7116)|
| 1:58:38| And you'll notice I haven't interjected anything into this conversation about mama or trains or trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7118)|
| 1:58:50| But it's something that needs to be more serious than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7130)|
| 1:58:55| And it needs to be decided on its merits, not on the politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7135)|
| 1:59:00| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7140)|
| 1:59:01| And thank you, Commissioners, for allowing me to run over my five-minute limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7141)|
| 1:59:08| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7148)|
| 1:59:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7150)|
| 1:59:12| Indeed, that's what I intended by the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7152)|
| 1:59:16| I thought it would be healthy for you, Mr. Wright, because of your investment in this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7156)|
| 1:59:24| And, of course, you're like our liaison school board member and you know quite a lot about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7164)|
| 1:59:32| And I, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7172)|
| 1:59:33| I understand heavy investments in topics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7173)|
| 1:59:39| And so it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7179)|
| 1:59:41| And I'm sort of Shawshank Redemption type phrase on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7181)|
| 1:59:49| I think, what is his name?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7189)|
| 1:59:50| Andy Dufresne said, a good thing never dies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7190)|
| 1:59:53| So if this is truly a good thing, it's not going to die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7193)|
| 1:59:57| But certainly the process in making it a reality is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7197)|
| 2:00:05| And the flaws in the process, there were flaws in the process, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7205)|
| 2:00:12| And this next phase, we'll iron those out and we'll continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7212)|
| 2:00:17| And I think we'll get to the right end point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7217)|
| 2:00:21| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7221)|
| 2:00:24| Appreciate the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7224)|
| 2:00:25| We will have an opportunity to talk about Carter more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| This is not the last opportunity we're going to have to talk about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7229)|
| 2:00:30| I'll be brief on the discussion to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7230)|
| 2:00:34| You know, it happened, or the downfall, 96 hours ago, four days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7234)|
| 2:00:38| I was in shock for a day or two, as I'm sure my colleagues were, even more, particularly Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7238)|
| 2:00:44| But these are brilliant businessmen, Mr. Durand, Mr. Talbot, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7244)|
| 2:00:51| And you look at their advisory board, they're some of the most prominent people in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7251)|
| 2:00:56| They had their reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7256)|
| 2:00:57| I don't know what they were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7257)|
| 2:00:58| I mean, maybe it was not a business decision or a political decision, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7258)|
| 2:01:02| They've all been in politics and have relatives in politics and fund people's campaigns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7262)|
| 2:01:09| And so I'm sure it was an analytical decision that was made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7269)|
| 2:01:14| And I don't know what it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7274)|
| 2:01:15| I know the speculation out on the street and in the courthouse and elsewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7275)|
| 2:01:19| I heard these speculations, I should say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7279)|
| 2:01:22| And I'm anxious to hear their side of the story someday, if we ever do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7282)|
| 2:01:26| But nevertheless, I'd like to see, I'd like to move this process on and see where it goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7286)|
| 2:01:31| Do we, are the documents, maybe boilerplate's not the word, but are they,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7291)|
| 2:01:36| can Devon Group just be whited out and the next guy put in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7296)|
| 2:01:40| That being partners or Acme Construction or somebody else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7300)|
| 2:01:43| Or does the whole wheel have to be reinvented again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7303)|
| 2:01:46| That's, it's a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7306)|
| 2:01:48| And within these last 96 hours, I haven't heard the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7308)|
| 2:01:51| And I've talked to legal counsel, Mr. Jarrett, and attorneys out on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7311)|
| 2:01:55| And I hear a lot, a big variation of opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7315)|
| 2:01:59| So I think that's where, that's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| It's stalled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7321)|
| 2:02:02| And the numbers are scary, I'll be frank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7322)|
| 2:02:05| I mean, we were, a year ago, we were talking about 5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| I think some guy stood there and said, I can build a school for 5 million or 6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| You know, that suddenly, as Dr. Briggs said last week, became 13 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7332)|
| 2:02:16| Some big, some awful big numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7336)|
| 2:02:18| So I think as stewards of the county's money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7338)|
| 2:02:22| we need to be very careful on this, on this project as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7342)|
| 2:02:26| And I look forward to hearing from Dr. McIntyre and some of his people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7346)|
| 2:02:29| I'm going to be touring some schools with him tomorrow, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7349)|
| 2:02:32| So I'm sure I'll hear, maybe I'll hear his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7352)|
| 2:02:35| And I'll hear, continue to hear the public's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7355)|
| 2:02:37| And thank you for indulging me, briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7357)|
| 2:02:39| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7359)|
| 2:02:41| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7361)|
| 2:02:43| My thought is, it's about the children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7363)|
| 2:02:45| I would like for us to get to an answer as quick as we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7365)|
| 2:02:48| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7368)|
| 2:02:50| Jeff, is this on topic, or mine's off topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7370)|
| 2:02:52| So I'm going to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7372)|
| 2:02:54| Yeah, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7374)|
| 2:02:56| I'm going to reverse the decision that I made, or statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7376)|
| 2:03:03| going back to what I said in the beginning when I gave my devotional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7383)|
| 2:03:07| And I didn't mean it to come out this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7387)|
| 2:03:10| But I meant to, what I was trying to say is that this should have been a discussion just between us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7390)|
| 2:03:18| But I feel that, back to my being civil to each other,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7398)|
| 2:03:25| I would like to give Indy and Dr. McIntyre to make a statement, if they would like, on this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7405)|
| 2:03:35| If they want to share why they changed their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7415)|
| 2:03:38| Me, personally, everybody's allowed to change their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7418)|
| 2:03:41| I don't need to know every time somebody makes a decision to change their mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7421)|
| 2:03:46| I mean, I've changed my mind up here just today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7426)|
| 2:03:49| And, I mean, if Amy changes her decision, her mind, I don't need to know the reasons why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7429)|
| 2:03:55| I mean, that's between her and whoever she wants to tell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7435)|
| 2:04:00| But, I mean, if it pleases the rest of the commission, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7440)|
| 2:04:07| I don't want Chairman, Chairperson Kincannon or Dr. McIntyre to feel like I'm the only one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7447)|
| 2:04:17| that's keeping them from speaking up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7457)|
| 2:04:19| Because if they want to speak and they came over here to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7459)|
| 2:04:22| then I'm free to listen to what they have to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7462)|
| 2:04:28| The chair is going to rule that this is a discussion by commissioners only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7468)|
| 2:04:33| Mr. Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7473)|
| 2:04:35| Is everybody done with Carter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7475)|
| 2:04:36| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7476)|
| 2:04:37| Mr. Chairman, I'd like permission to, if it's not on the agenda, I'd like permission to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7477)|
| 2:04:41| And I've asked the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7481)|
| 2:04:42| He said it's up to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7482)|
| 2:04:43| On a zoning issue, I won't be here at 6 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7483)|
| 2:04:46| And I've met with two people twice on a zoning issue that I'd really like to speak about, if that's okay with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7486)|
| 2:04:52| It is, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7492)|
| 2:04:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7493)|
| 2:04:54| At 6 o'clock, you guys are going to have a zoning in regard to Cogdill Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7494)|
| 2:05:01| It is PSC metals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7501)|
| 2:05:03| I've met with, there were some deliberations on the north side of the property and on the south side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7503)|
| 2:05:13| On the south side of the property, Mr. King represented the people that were concerned about the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7513)|
| 2:05:18| They worked out what I think is a good plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7518)|
| 2:05:22| I met with the church that's north.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7522)|
| 2:05:28| I don't know if it's Pastor Brabson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7528)|
| 2:05:30| New Covenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7530)|
| 2:05:31| New Covenant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7531)|
| 2:05:32| I met with Pastor Brabson and his trustees and some staff twice, once with PSC metals and once by myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7532)|
| 2:05:40| I think that they feel more comfortable than they did going into the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7540)|
| 2:05:45| The reason that they wanted to meet was that they weren't afforded any notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7545)|
| 2:05:52| and they didn't feel like they were part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| And I agree with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7555)|
| 2:05:57| I think MPC or the staff, the attorneys of PSC should have included them at the very beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7557)|
| 2:06:04| But I think once they heard the information, they feel like the PSC will run a better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7564)|
| 2:06:08| more clean and better operation than what they have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7568)|
| 2:06:12| And so if you guys would support that, I would appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7572)|
| 2:06:16| Before I get to Commissioner Burwells, we have two of our commissioners that have special days today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7576)|
| 2:06:21| Commissioner Smith, celebrating his 26th anniversary today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7581)|
| 2:06:25| So, Commissioner Mrs. Smith, congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7585)|
| 2:06:29| Also, we have our vice chair, Mr. Anders, who at 6 o'clock is going to be over at the safety building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7589)|
| 2:06:35| where he is going to be promoted to lieutenant to the Knoxville Police Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7595)|
| 2:06:38| So, congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7598)|
| 2:06:41| It's actually at the auditorium, but thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7601)|
| 2:06:43| It's the auditorium, so if anybody wants to go and see and shake his hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7603)|
| 2:06:46| Commissioner Burwells, you had something about backpacks at Beaumont.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7606)|
| 2:06:52| Last week, the resource officer at Beaumont, Officer Murphy, mentioned to me that Beaumont was short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7612)|
| 2:07:00| about 75 backpacks for all of their students to have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7620)|
| 2:07:05| And I told him I'd help him get that together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7625)|
| 2:07:10| I reached out to Ed and Mike Hammond, and since they're the at-large commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7630)|
| 2:07:15| and they've come through with some donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7635)|
| 2:07:17| In fact, Mike is arranging for Wivik the Frog to come out tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7637)|
| 2:07:24| and be at a location where people can drive by on their lunch hour and make donations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7644)|
| 2:07:28| So, if anybody would like to make a contribution, if you have any gently used backpacks at your home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7648)|
| 2:07:35| that you want to bless someone else with, or if you want to make a personal financial contribution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7655)|
| 2:07:42| of, you know, 20 bucks, 30 bucks to help buy backpacks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7662)|
| 2:07:46| then the kids and the faculty and staff at Beaumont would greatly appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7666)|
| 2:07:53| So, just see me afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7673)|
| 2:07:56| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7676)|
| 2:07:58| Mr. Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7678)|
| 2:08:00| Are we sort of just in a making announcements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7680)|
| 2:08:02| I just wanted to mention I have the honor of being the president of the Tennessee Valley Fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7682)|
| 2:08:09| It's an honorary position, no pay involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7689)|
| 2:08:12| And in 17 days, the 92nd Fair opens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7692)|
| 2:08:16| And each commissioner and each city councilman and school board member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7696)|
| 2:08:20| and other members of the media and the public and business people, anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7700)|
| 2:08:24| I want to just put it on your calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7704)|
| 2:08:26| The 9th of September at noon is our lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7706)|
| 2:08:29| And I hope everyone will come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7709)|
| 2:08:30| I'll make sure Joey sunshines it and sends out another notice for everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7710)|
| 2:08:35| I'm the new UT president speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7715)|
| 2:08:39| And Jimmy Duncan speaks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7719)|
| 2:08:41| And I assure you that I know who will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7721)|
| 2:08:43| And that's all these candidates for these signs we're seeing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| The mayoral candidates will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7726)|
| 2:08:48| The city council candidates will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7728)|
| 2:08:50| And the four candidates for the Senate seat will be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7730)|
| 2:08:53| So, you can get some opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7733)|
| 2:08:55| But just please put that on your calendar, September 9th at noon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7735)|
| 2:08:58| And I will make sure you get a reminder for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7738)|
| 2:09:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7740)|
| 2:09:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7741)|
| 2:09:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7742)|
| 2:09:03| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7743)|
| 2:09:05| I actually just wanted to comment on Commissioner Andrews' topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7745)|
| 2:09:10| And I just wanted to compliment him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7750)|
| 2:09:13| That was a, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7753)|
| 2:09:15| And I know we all deal with things that sound nice and smooth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7755)|
| 2:09:19| But I think there were a lot of emotions initially, you know, involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7759)|
| 2:09:22| And rightfully so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7762)|
| 2:09:23| So, I do appreciate Commissioner Andrews really kind of taking the lead on that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7763)|
| 2:09:29| and hashing out an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7769)|
| 2:09:32| Hopefully it will be an agreement at 6 o'clock that I think everyone will be happy with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7772)|
| 2:09:36| Just wanted to, you know, say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7776)|
| 2:09:40| No further business come before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7780)|
| 2:09:41| We are adjourned until 6, at which time we'll hear zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7781)|
| 2:09:59| We'll call into session the zoning portion of our August Knox County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7799)|
| 2:10:04| Clerk, if you'd call the roll, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7804)|

| 2:10:20| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7820)|

| 2:10:22| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7822)|
| 2:10:23| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7823)|
| 2:10:24| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7824)|
| 2:10:25| Commissioner Schell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7825)|
| 2:10:26| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7826)|
| 2:10:27| Ten members present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7827)|
| 2:10:28| Let's go to the first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7828)|
| 2:10:31| Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7831)|
| 2:10:32| The first item is 6-D-11-OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7832)|
| 2:10:33| It's a request of the Metropolitan Planning Commission to approve the report of the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7833)|
| 2:10:34| County Stormwater Ordinance Review Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7834)|
| 2:10:35| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7835)|
| 2:10:36| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7836)|
| 2:10:37| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7837)|
| 2:10:38| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7838)|
| 2:10:39| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7839)|
| 2:10:40| This isn't really directly relevant to the report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7840)|
| 2:10:41| But in the last month or so, I just wanted to alert the Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7841)|
| 2:11:03| We had an event on Copper Ridge that was a pretty significant stormwater event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7863)|
| 2:11:11| It got some publicity in the paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7871)|
| 2:11:13| I think Mr. R. Larry Smith was in one of the local papers about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7873)|
| 2:11:21| Anyway, I think that the severity of that situation requires a little closer look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7881)|
| 2:11:29| And I just wanted to alert the body that next month I'm going to ask the engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7889)|
| 2:11:34| department to report on the event in some way that we learn from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7894)|
| 2:11:39| What did we do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7899)|
| 2:11:40| What did we not do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7900)|
| 2:11:42| What can we learn from this event?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7902)|
| 2:11:44| Give us some kind of description and analysis of what's going on relative to our stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7904)|
| 2:11:53| codes that we have right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7913)|
| 2:11:55| So I'm just giving you a heads up and then go ahead with the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7915)|
| 2:12:01| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7921)|
| 2:12:02| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7922)|
| 2:12:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7923)|
| 2:12:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7924)|
| 2:12:05| The motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7925)|
| 2:12:06| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7926)|
| 2:12:07| The next item is 6-A-11-SP, request of PSC Metals, Inc., for Northwest County Sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom110822?start=7927)|
