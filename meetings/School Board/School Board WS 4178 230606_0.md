| 0:42:40| Let's talk about the implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| So we're at the beginning of the implementation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| So these are just words on the page, right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| unless we have an action plan to get this ball rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| So that's what we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| the implementation phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| So we're at the beginning of the implementation process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2572)|
| 0:42:54| and are still developing our path forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| on how we're going to put the Region 5 way into action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| So the community will play an important role| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2579)|
| 0:43:01| in helping map out and determine this pathway forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| So working groups of Region 5 educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| and community members have been established already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| for each action outlined in the plan to guide execution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| and make sure the work moves forward successfully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| We're also developing interim annual goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| that you'll see in the plan also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| to make sure that we stay on track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| to meet our big five-year goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2600)|
| 0:43:23| So we have everything laid out in the Region 5 plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| and keep using this word in Region 5 called NIMBL.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2605)|
| 0:43:28| So we want to make sure that we have those metrics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2608)|
| 0:43:31| but understanding that this is a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| and we have working groups to help us guide along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| but sometimes we may need to be nimble and adjust here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2615)|
| 0:43:38| as needed based on how we look at the plan and the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| because it is a plan with words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| but when we put the plan into action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2622)|
| 0:43:44| we may need to adjust as we see fit with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| And so now I'm going to turn it over to Mr. Jason Myers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| and he's going to talk about the Region 5 way commitments here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| Thank you, Dexter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2636)|

| 0:44:03| as well as their team, the Region 5 Instructional Support Team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2643)|
| 0:44:07| Certainly we're very proud of this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| but don't get it be under the misconception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2649)|
| 0:44:12| that we've just been hanging out working on a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2652)|
| 0:44:15| for the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2655)|

| 0:44:26| as the team they have around them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2666)|
| 0:44:27| and I'm very blessed to have Dexter and Salih| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| leading the way in this Region 5 work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2670)|

| 0:44:36| I'm very proud of the plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| and I think the booklet that has been put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| looks really nice and I'm excited that it looks nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| However, this is the easy part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| The plan is the easy part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| The success and failure of this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| will depend on everyone's willingness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| to collectively come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| and take action to implement the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2694)|
| 0:44:58| In our community meetings, we submitted a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| I'm going to do the same tonight to our board members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2701)|
| 0:45:03| our audience, those who are streaming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2703)|
| 0:45:05| You've heard what the Region 5 way is going to be about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2705)|
| 0:45:08| so I challenge you to ask yourself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2708)|
| 0:45:11| what are you uniquely positioned to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| to support the work in Region 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2713)|
| 0:45:15| We're here today to ask folks to come along with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2715)|
| 0:45:18| and help transform these schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2718)|
| 0:45:21| We are here to recognize that we can't do it on our own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2721)|
| 0:45:25| in isolation, that it's going to take a collective group effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| So if you're sitting here and you think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| hey, I could contribute in this way, awesome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2730)|

| 0:45:46| We really do want this to be a collective effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2746)|
| 0:45:51| On our end, the KCS side of the commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2751)|
| 0:45:53| is that our kids are going to learn from elite educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| Our kids are going to enter first-grade school ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| Our students are going to perform math and reading above grade level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| and that our students are going to graduate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| ready to pursue high-wage, high-demand jobs of their choosing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| So that's what KCS is going to be about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2769)|
| 0:46:12| is making sure that we give students every opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2772)|
| 0:46:15| to be successful and, more importantly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2775)|
| 0:46:17| the support that they may need to find that success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2777)|
| 0:46:21| No plan is complete without ambitious goals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| and we wanted to make sure that, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| we want to reflect what we're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2786)|
| 0:46:28| It's not enough just to say that we're going to have high expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2788)|
| 0:46:31| Your goals should reflect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| So for us, three times the number of third-graders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2793)|
| 0:46:36| at or above grade level in reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| six times the number of eighth-graders at or above grade level in math,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| and four times the number of students graduating high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| ready for college and career.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| So we have ambitious goals to go alongside our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2807)|
| 0:46:52| So, again, we're really excited to get this ball rolling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| We start with some of these implementation teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2815)|
| 0:46:58| and training folks on Wednesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| and we're going to be moving at a breakneck pace| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2821)|
| 0:47:03| to make sure that we're ready for a successful launch in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2823)|
| 0:47:07| We want school on August 1st to feel different when our staff comes back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2827)|
| 0:47:11| and then when our students walk back through the doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| we want it to feel different for them to ride out of the gate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| as we enter into this five-year strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2836)|
| 0:47:21| So we've referenced these community meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2841)|
| 0:47:23| just so everyone's on the same page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2843)|
| 0:47:25| These meetings were held at Austin East, Fulton, Lonsdale, and Sarah Moore Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2845)|
| 0:47:30| and we had multilingual options and translators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2850)|
| 0:47:33| and they were just very well attended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2853)|
| 0:47:37| We're really, again, excited to hear from our community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2857)|
| 0:47:40| and we're going to show a quick video| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2860)|
| 0:47:42| just so that you all can also experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2862)|
| 0:47:44| some of what our community members had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2864)|
| 0:48:01| We came up with what we call the Region 5 Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| Repeat after me, the Region 5 Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2884)|
| 0:48:06| The Region 5 Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2886)|
| 0:48:07| One more time, the Region 5 Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2887)|
| 0:48:09| The Region 5 Way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2889)|
| 0:48:10| Exactly, like Superintendent Rogers said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2890)|
| 0:48:12| Region 5 is going to be the pace car for KCS, amen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2892)|
| 0:48:15| Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| All right, so that's how I love that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2896)|
| 0:48:17| because I feel like, you know, with this work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| it's going to be really powerful work, and it is really powerful work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2899)|
| 0:48:22| but this is just a plan unless we make it an action, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2902)|
| 0:48:26| Excellence in foundational skills can only be realized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| when schools hold students to high academic expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| Is that easy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| But is anything worthwhile really easy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2922)|
| 0:48:43| We understand the needs and the beliefs and the values| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2923)|
| 0:48:46| may be different across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| Our expectations for all of our students are the same,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2928)|
| 0:48:50| but how we get there could be different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| and for us, that's why having this Region 5 kind of pulled out as unique| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2932)|
| 0:48:57| was really a chance for us to look at students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2937)|
| 0:48:59| from when they're born until they graduate and beyond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2939)|
| 0:49:03| This is a new effort in Region 5 to come together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| and ask the community and our partners to come alongside us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2947)|
| 0:49:10| as we try to transform schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| and hopefully the outcomes for our students in Region 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2952)|
| 0:49:16| I know I speak for all of our community school staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2956)|
| 0:49:19| and our leadership and our steering committees and our partners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2959)|
| 0:49:21| when I say that we are excited to join in with Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2961)|
| 0:49:24| to help start fulfilling this promise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2964)|
| 0:49:26| and my question for everybody is, who is with us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| Now, just because something is new doesn't mean it's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| But as I went through the process and heard the questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2973)|
| 0:49:37| that we were being asked and the answers that they wanted to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2977)|
| 0:49:41| that also I became excited about and hopeful about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| All students have a basic right to great public schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| and the Region 5 plan articulates what great public schools need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2990)|
| 0:49:57| and can provide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2997)|
| 0:49:59| Earlier this year I was asked to participate in an interview| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=2999)|
| 0:50:02| to talk about what KCS can do to make a difference for my kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| for all kids, and I will say I've been around for 21 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3006)|
| 0:50:11| and I've never been asked to participate on this level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| so thank you guys for including us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3016)|
| 0:50:19| This was truly a process where the community spoke,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| our voices were heard, even with other persons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3024)|
| 0:50:28| If you participated in the listening process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| and you see one of your ideas in the strategic plan, raise your hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| So they truly, truly did listen to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3036)|
| 0:50:38| It didn't fall on deaf ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3038)|
| 0:50:40| So this is a collective way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3040)|
| 0:50:42| If you know what the process is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3042)|
| 0:50:44| if you know what the elements of the processes are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3044)|
| 0:50:47| then you can look within that process and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| how can I make a difference in one of those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3050)|
| 0:50:55| For not your kids, not your kids, not your kids, not your kids,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3055)|
| 0:51:02| not my kids, but our kids and our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| And it's not just a process leading up to now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| As we move forward, it's also a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| And as we're going through that process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3072)|
| 0:51:14| I hope that each of you will take on the task of bringing some more folks in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3074)|
| 0:51:19| bring in some more community members,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| bring in some more people to the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| So how will we support that Region 5 plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| Well, one, it's through our Just Lead Ministries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| Secondly, through that Region 5 way, through our Collinear Career Program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| And then finally, just being a partner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3093)|
| 0:51:36| just being a partner for the high schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3096)|
| 0:51:38| Our Just Lead Ministries stays in close contact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| with all of the students and programs teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3101)|
| 0:51:43| just to kind of see if there's any referral services that they may need,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3103)|
| 0:51:47| as well as after school care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| And our Collinear Career, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| just really supporting anything that's going on here at Austin East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| We have already been working with Knox County Schools for a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3114)|
| 0:51:58| And in fact, I would say one of the highlights of our partnership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3118)|
| 0:52:01| was featured last Saturday at our commencement exercise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3121)|
| 0:52:04| when we conferred 28 associate degrees on Knox County students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| Two of which, Mr. Superintendent, have 4.0s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3129)|
| 0:52:17| And so our commitment today is that we will partner with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3137)|
| 0:52:24| in education and awareness and exposing students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| to the many opportunities that are available to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3147)|

| 0:53:12| the heart of the community rallying around doing what's best for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3192)|
| 0:53:15| And that's what's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3195)|
| 0:53:16| So thank you guys so much for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3196)|
| 0:53:18| I think there was another slide, but I'm not sure if it's going to come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| But it has a QR code on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| There it is, and you can follow our progress there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| if you want to click that slide and save it in your phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| But thank you guys so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3208)|
| 0:53:30| And also, just two words to think about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3210)|
| 0:53:33| Like Mr. Meyers said, it's time for us to accelerate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3213)|
| 0:53:36| It's going to be accelerated work, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| But the plan makes it sustainable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| So a lot of times we go fast with things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3220)|
| 0:53:42| but we don't have a sustainable foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3222)|
| 0:53:44| So we have that acceleration with you guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| but we have that sustainability also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3227)|
| 0:53:49| So thank you guys so much for listening to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| All right. Good stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| Thank you, Dr. Murphy and Ms. Reynolds and Mr. Meyers and Superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3236)|
| 0:54:02| It's really exciting, and I love the Region 5 way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| I love that branding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3245)|
| 0:54:09| So great stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3249)|
| 0:54:11| So any comments or questions or anything anybody wants to speak to on these items| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3251)|
| 0:54:20| before we move into the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3260)|
| 0:54:23| Reverend Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3263)|
| 0:54:25| I feel somewhat compelled to speak on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3265)|
| 0:54:28| but I'll make it really short that I'm excited about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| I concur that it is a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3271)|
| 0:54:34| So every page in this is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3274)|
| 0:54:39| but I'll leave the last part of it about how we're going to implement it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3279)|
| 0:54:42| and get the community involved as well as parents and teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| and administrators as well as the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3287)|
| 0:54:50| The other thing I would say is that I would just want to make sure that the Region 5 way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| is part of the Knox County Schools way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3295)|
| 0:54:58| So this is not just our school, this is our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3298)|
| 0:55:03| So we invite your involvement, your input, and everything else that goes along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3303)|
| 0:55:08| And I want to thank Mr. Meyers and the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3308)|
| 0:55:15| Salih, did I say it right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| I've been saying Sally for months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| I know, but I wasn't doing it on purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3323)|
| 0:55:26| But Salih and Dexter and everyone involved, all the principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3326)|
| 0:55:30| and everywhere we went was very excited, staff was very excited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3330)|
| 0:55:34| and parents were very excited, and the community is very excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3334)|
| 0:55:37| So we invite this board to come along with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3337)|
| 0:55:42| Thank you. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3342)|
| 0:55:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3344)|
| 0:55:46| I know I'm just becoming exposed to the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| but I do have a lot of hope for it for one main reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| and that is to the degree that I'm hearing the community is engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3351)|
| 0:55:55| and supportive of the work and involved in the work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3355)|
| 0:55:58| To me, we can go really far when we go together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3358)|
| 0:56:01| And so I really appreciate that emphasis on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3361)|
| 0:56:05| And I know this is the strategic plan for Region 5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3365)|
| 0:56:09| It may be something that ends up getting retooled in other regions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3369)|
| 0:56:13| There may be other specific regional plans at some point in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3373)|
| 0:56:17| And I believe moving into those other regions with different plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3377)|
| 0:56:20| that they're only going to be as effective as when we do it together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3380)|
| 0:56:23| and we bring the community involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3383)|
| 0:56:25| So I hope we learn a lot from this experience that not only helps the schools in Region 5,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3385)|
| 0:56:30| but also just helps us in the way that we engage community in that process moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3390)|
| 0:56:35| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3395)|
| 0:56:37| Thank you, Mr. Watson. Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3399)|
| 0:56:40| I just wanted to say I appreciate the superintendent and his team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3400)|
| 0:56:44| involving the community and getting all the feedback and all the stakeholder input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3404)|
| 0:56:49| I think it really includes all of the different aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3409)|
| 0:56:54| So well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| Mr. Watson, I love that idea about a plan for each region| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| because they are so different and have different challenges and opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3420)|
| 0:57:04| And so, yeah, so maybe this will be a model down the road for other regions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3424)|
| 0:57:09| And so, yeah, I'm excited about where we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| and the community input and excitement is wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3436)|
| 0:57:19| Thank you, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3439)|
| 0:57:27| All right, so moving into the regular agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| I'm going to consent agenda, items A, A, or B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3452)|
| 0:57:41| Items and contracts, C, item 1 or 2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3461)|
| 0:57:50| Items 3 or 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3477)|
| 0:57:58| My question is on C1 about TIGER.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3478)|
| 0:58:03| Are all of our schools now doing TIGER evaluations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3483)|
| 0:58:09| Madam Chair, Ms. Horne, yes, all of our schools are now doing TIGER| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3489)|
| 0:58:13| and TIGER requires our MOU so as to reaffirm that we're going to follow the rules every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3493)|
| 0:58:19| So this is the same MOU that we signed last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3499)|
| 0:58:21| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| Ms. Sullen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3504)|
| 0:58:25| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3505)|
| 0:58:26| My question is on number 4 and I don't necessarily need this quickly or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| but at some point I would like to see just a list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3512)|
| 0:58:37| or an inventory of what vehicles we have countywide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3517)|
| 0:58:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3522)|
| 0:58:46| All right, item C5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3526)|
| 0:58:53| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3533)|
| 0:58:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3534)|
| 0:58:55| I reviewed it, but it just didn't stand out to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3535)|
| 0:58:58| Can somebody speak to what was actually amended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3538)|
| 0:59:00| What's the difference in the agreement for school bus services on item 5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3540)|
| 0:59:07| Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3547)|
| 0:59:08| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson, basically that was a 2% increase due to inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3553)|
| 0:59:14| And gas prices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| I remember us discussing that, but I wasn't sure what specifically changed in this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3555)|
| 0:59:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3559)|
| 0:59:21| Ms. Horne, did you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| I actually had a question on number 2 on the data sharing agreement with instruction partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3565)|
| 0:59:29| Is this a new contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3569)|
| 0:59:35| Ms. Faulkner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3575)|
| 0:59:37| So I believe that this is a new data sharing agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3577)|
| 0:59:41| but it reflects a previous contract that we have had with instruction partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| Dr. Phillips is actually with us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3587)|
| 0:59:49| and I don't know if she'd like to say anything about the scope of work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| or if you have any specific questions about the scope of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3592)|
| 0:59:56| Yeah, my question was really just around whether it is just an updated agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| if there's any changes, and does the data sharing that we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3600)|
| 1:00:05| is it changing in any way or is it basically continuing as in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3605)|
| 1:00:12| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3612)|
| 1:00:13| So the contract is the same contract we've had in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3613)|
| 1:00:17| It is an extension of the work we've previously done with instruction partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3617)|
| 1:00:22| Previously they've worked in two of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| Now they're going to do research in eight of our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3624)|
| 1:00:28| and so there will also be partnership support in many other schools on top of that research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3628)|
| 1:00:34| And so this expands the data sharing to include all of the schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| in which instruction partners will be supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3638)|
| 1:00:42| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3642)|
| 1:00:44| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3644)|
| 1:00:46| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3646)|
| 1:00:47| My question is back on number five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| The additional $400,000, is that something we have already budgeted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| or is that coming from somewhere else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3654)|
| 1:01:00| Did we already budget that increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3660)|
| 1:01:02| Ms. Himelgaard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3662)|
| 1:01:04| Madam Chair, Ms. Owen, I will confirm that and let you all know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3664)|
| 1:01:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3668)|
| 1:01:11| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3671)|
| 1:01:13| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3673)|
| 1:01:14| Just going back to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3674)|
| 1:01:16| The new agreement talks about research for eight of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| Research to what end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| What's the research?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| What's the point of the research?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3682)|
| 1:01:24| We'll bring Dr. Phillips back up for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| Yeah, thank you, Dr. Phillips.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| So in eight of our schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| instruction partners will be doing research on small group foundational literacy instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3692)|
| 1:01:37| Within that study, they will be supporting diverse student populations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3697)|
| 1:01:43| within regions one through four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3703)|
| 1:01:46| while also leading up to the 24-25 academic year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3706)|
| 1:01:52| with supporting region five schools within research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3712)|
| 1:01:56| This year, they will also be partnering with every region five elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3716)|
| 1:02:01| outside of the research study by providing intensive support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| centered around whole group foundational literacy instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| And then in the 24-25 academic year, once they have a year of research under their belt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3728)|
| 1:02:13| and they can make strong recommendations for specific strategies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3733)|
| 1:02:17| they will support five region five elementary schools within the research component| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3737)|
| 1:02:23| by intensely focusing on that specific strategy in small group foundational literacy instruction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3743)|
| 1:02:29| Thank you. That's really helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3749)|
| 1:02:30| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| Are there any other questions about number two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3752)|
| 1:02:35| I'm not Madam Chair. I shouldn't ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| No, that was a good question. I'm glad you did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| I would have. You just speak me to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| I was going to tell you to sit closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| Madam Chair, Ms. Owen, that $400,000 is part of the transportation budget for FY 24.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3768)|
| 1:02:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3776)|
| 1:02:58| So moving on to item six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3778)|
| 1:03:06| Item seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3786)|
| 1:03:11| Item eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| Item nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3796)|
| 1:03:21| Item ten.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3801)|
| 1:03:27| Eleven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3807)|
| 1:03:43| Hold on. I went from 11 to 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3823)|
| 1:03:52| Okay. So item 12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3832)|
| 1:03:58| It's a ban.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| Item 13 or 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3841)|
| 1:04:08| Item 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3848)|
| 1:04:17| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3857)|
| 1:04:18| So moving to board policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3858)|
| 1:04:24| 9A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| Is this you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| I'm wondering on B100, when we're looking at board self-evaluation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3869)|
| 1:04:35| if we should clarify somewhere in there that this is different from our individual self-evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3875)|
| 1:04:42| that we do with TSBA for boardsmanship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3882)|
| 1:04:51| Because this is a whole board self-evaluation and the boardsmanship self-evaluation is individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3891)|
| 1:05:00| Would that be clear to everybody without something else in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3900)|
| 1:05:07| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3907)|
| 1:05:08| As a suggestion, could we retitle the policy to Board of Education Evaluation and just be specific?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3908)|
| 1:05:19| Because that's what we're evaluating, the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3919)|
| 1:05:21| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| Because self could be interpreted one of two ways, individually or as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3924)|
| 1:05:29| So we will move to self-evaluation and the Board of Education evaluation to the title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3929)|
| 1:05:38| Does that sound good?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3938)|
| 1:05:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3939)|
| 1:05:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| Moving on, board policy 9B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3945)|
| 1:05:51| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3951)|
| 1:05:52| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3952)|
| 1:05:53| I have some concerns about the timeline for signing up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| I understand the limitations of the room and that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| However, there have been some community members who have contacted me concerned that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3963)|
| 1:06:10| when we have an agenda that comes out late on a Thursday evening, maybe they don't see that immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3970)|
| 1:06:18| And by the time they see it, it's too late for them to call and sign up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3978)|
| 1:06:22| When they can sign up before the meeting, that's plenty of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3982)|
| 1:06:26| The other concern that exists is that if there were something to be on the agenda that a particular group knew was going to be on the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3986)|
| 1:06:37| then they would be able to come and speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| But people who saw it when it actually came out might not have the same opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4001)|
| 1:06:46| So my suggestion would be either that we keep that the way it is so that people can sign up to speak when they arrive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4006)|
| 1:06:54| or that we back up the timeline for the publication of the agenda so that people will have more time to be aware of what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4014)|
| 1:07:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4030)|
| 1:07:11| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4031)|
| 1:07:13| Any other comments or feedback on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4033)|
| 1:07:22| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4042)|
| 1:07:23| So moving on to Board Policies Item C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4043)|
| 1:07:29| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4049)|
| 1:07:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| On page 2, bullet point 11, there's just a word missing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4052)|
| 1:07:38| It should say, give full time and attention to the duties of the Director of Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4058)|
| 1:07:43| Of also got deleted in the red line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4063)|
| 1:07:45| So it just doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4065)|
| 1:07:51| Noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| So anything else on that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4075)|
| 1:08:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4080)|
| 1:08:01| Item D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4081)|
| 1:08:10| Item E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4090)|
| 1:08:16| Item F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4096)|
| 1:08:22| Item G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4102)|
| 1:08:28| Item H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4108)|
| 1:08:31| I'm sorry, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| I'd like to look at E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4112)|
| 1:08:35| E. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4115)|
| 1:08:36| I couldn't find it there for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4120)|
| 1:08:41| So looking at Item E, I left two little packets in front of everyone's microphone this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4121)|
| 1:08:49| When we discussed this in policy review, it was stated that this more aligned with the job description policy that most of our other schools use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4129)|
| 1:09:08| And I believe what we actually said was that it matches TSBA's model policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4148)|
| 1:09:16| We're really kind of guessing at that since we aren't members to, well, we don't subscribe to that model policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4156)|
| 1:09:23| I think if we want to more actively look at what model policy is from TSBA, it would be good for us to subscribe to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4163)|
| 1:09:34| Go ahead and have that expense so that we can actually know because some of these policies we're guessing at based on what other schools have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4174)|
| 1:09:44| However, the point here is that when we change this policy to the language that is being changed there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4184)|
| 1:09:53| what we're really getting into is more of the job descriptions policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4193)|
| 1:09:59| And if we look at these two samples, you have one from O'Brien County and one from Hamilton County, hopefully, if I passed them out right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4199)|
| 1:10:12| And these are just some pulled from throughout their policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4212)|
| 1:10:18| The language that we are taking out is still in their policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4218)|
| 1:10:25| So that language is still in what we are considering to be model policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4225)|
| 1:10:30| It's just in different policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4230)|
| 1:10:33| So I think we would be very remiss in removing this based on the idea that we are trying to match model policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4233)|
| 1:10:40| because that's really not what's happening at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4240)|
| 1:10:44| That language is still in other policies for other districts, even if it's not exactly in the same policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4244)|
| 1:10:55| Part of this is where we have combined policies, other districts have combined policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4255)|
| 1:11:01| and I think we're getting into some real concerning territory| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4261)|
| 1:11:06| when we look at taking out a huge swath of language that we don't have anywhere else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4266)|
| 1:11:12| And if we look at these two samples, we'll see that it's worded several different ways and in several different places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4272)|
| 1:11:21| and I don't think we're going to have that if we take it out here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4281)|
| 1:11:26| So whether we get into discussing how we want to manage or not, either way we look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4286)|
| 1:11:36| we can't say that it's from model policy because that's just not really accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4296)|
| 1:11:46| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4306)|
| 1:11:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4309)|
| 1:11:50| Ms. Owen, are you specifically referring to lines two through three in current policy C132?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4310)|
| 1:11:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4318)|
| 1:11:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4319)|
| 1:12:00| Yes, the lines two through, I guess, four that basically hand over our responsibility to the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4320)|
| 1:12:26| Is there any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4350)|
| 1:12:31| Can somebody that's more well versed in our policies and especially all these proposed changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4351)|
| 1:12:37| speak to Ms. Owen's concern about this being removed from this policy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| Are there any other places in any of our other policies that speak to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4361)|
| 1:12:47| specifically the line that I'm thinking about is constrained by the board, approved by the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4367)|
| 1:12:50| by state law and or by state rules, regulations, minimum standards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4370)|
| 1:12:57| That part is somewhere else in our policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4377)|
| 1:13:00| The part that is not anywhere else is the part that says all new administrative and supervisory positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4380)|
| 1:13:08| in the school system are established initially by the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4388)|
| 1:13:11| That's the part that is concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4391)|
| 1:13:15| If we look through these others, there are some districts that actually, I may not have them here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4395)|
| 1:13:20| there are some districts that actually require every new position to be approved by the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4400)|
| 1:13:27| As far as I have seen, there is nothing else that has that part in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4407)|
| 1:13:35| That's a major power to be handing over that would potentially, in the hands of someone in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4415)|
| 1:13:48| that could potentially cause some huge ballooning of central office with no oversight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4428)|
| 1:13:55| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4435)|
| 1:13:57| That's what I wanted to clarify because you had mentioned lines two through four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4437)|
| 1:14:00| but I felt like I had read the constrained part in forward somewhere else in another policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4440)|
| 1:14:06| so you're specifically speaking to the first part of that sentence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4446)|
| 1:14:18| Anything else on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4458)|
| 1:14:26| Item F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4466)|
| 1:14:31| Item G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4471)|
| 1:14:36| Item H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4476)|
| 1:14:42| Or I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4482)|
| 1:14:49| J or K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4493)|
| 1:14:54| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4494)|
| 1:14:56| I believe this question was asked in our policy review around item J,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4496)|
| 1:15:01| where it says, in line, I guess, starting in two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4501)|
| 1:15:07| earned outside the district shall be accepted only with prior written permission of the high school principal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4507)|
| 1:15:12| and only within the following limited conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4512)|
| 1:15:15| It refers to the high school credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4515)|
| 1:15:18| Is that a credit per year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4518)|
| 1:15:20| Is that one total credit ever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4520)|
| 1:15:22| Did that question get answered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4522)|
| 1:15:23| Because that was a question that was brought up in policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4523)|
| 1:15:31| Mr. Dupler, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| I'll start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| Ms. Horne, you can jump in if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4534)|
| 1:15:36| The state law says nothing about limiting it to one year or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4536)|
| 1:15:42| The way I read it, it's going to depend upon the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| If the course is approved in a block schedule for one semester, then that's what it's approved for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4544)|
| 1:15:50| If it's a year-long course, then that's what it's approved for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4550)|
| 1:15:53| The state law itself is not specific.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4553)|
| 1:15:56| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| I just want to be clear that I understood what the intent was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| Ms. Helen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| I want to remind the Board that this policy wasn't actually available when we met in policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4565)|
| 1:16:11| and so this hasn't gone to policy review yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| To be consistent, any time something has come before us that has not gone through policy review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| I have always asked that we send it back there before we actually read it as a full Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4580)|
| 1:16:27| The other concern I have is that the law also requires that the Board approve the curriculum for the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4587)|
| 1:16:38| I think it would be probably wise for us to look at that altogether as we're looking at approving the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4598)|
| 1:16:48| because we should be looking at what it is that we're actually approving when we're doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4608)|
| 1:16:54| So I'd like to suggest that this goes back to policy review so that we can consistently follow our policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4614)|
| 1:17:01| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4621)|
| 1:17:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| This is a policy that I mentioned at policy review that Mr. Dupler had just worked on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| and didn't have time to get it ready because of the time frame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| It was mentioned at policy review, but we didn't have it to discuss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4633)|
| 1:17:21| The entity that is wanting to utilize this, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4641)|
| 1:17:24| this is a major thing for them to know whether this Board needs to approve it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4644)|
| 1:17:30| so that students could utilize the credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| That's the purpose of adding it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| I think my question would be probably for Dr. Wilson around approving the curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4656)|
| 1:17:45| Could you speak to what that process would be and the time frame on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4665)|
| 1:17:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4672)|
| 1:17:53| I would want to go back and look at that law a little more specifically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| and that might be something we could do and maybe talk about Thursday at the other meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4677)|
| 1:18:02| As I recall from that, because this is not a course we would be providing any funding for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4682)|
| 1:18:09| or doing anything of that nature, and it goes back under the law of the release time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4689)|
| 1:18:15| which allows students to earn credit for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4695)|
| 1:18:17| I would want to look more closely at that before I spoke with 100% certainty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| on exactly what our role in approving that curriculum would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| This is modeled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4708)|
| 1:18:31| Campbell County has a learning center that's currently utilizing the release time law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| and so this organization that has contacted me is basically planning to do the same thing they have done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4717)|
| 1:18:47| So there is precedent in the Campbell County curriculum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4727)|
| 1:18:52| and following the state guidelines for that curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4732)|
| 1:19:05| All right, so any other questions or is there any other discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4745)|
| 1:19:18| Item K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4758)|
| 1:19:24| Item L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4764)|
| 1:19:30| Or item M.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4770)|
| 1:19:33| Before we discuss item M, Mr. Myers, can you speak a little bit to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4773)|
| 1:19:38| It seems like we spoke in our agenda set meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4778)|
| 1:19:43| that it might be beneficial to approve this one on the first reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4783)|
| 1:19:47| just to kind of get staff educated on the policy as well as people time to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4787)|
| 1:19:54| Yeah, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4794)|
| 1:19:56| So yeah, it was in the public agenda set meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| Yeah, I do think that there is value in the board considering passing this on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4800)|
| 1:20:06| Certainly it gives us time to work in the month of July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4806)|
| 1:20:11| to go ahead and start allowing families to use this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4811)|
| 1:20:14| so that we can be in the best possible position to implement in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4814)|
| 1:20:20| So I would support if the board, if it were the will of the board to pass it on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4820)|
| 1:20:29| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4829)|
| 1:20:31| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| Mr. Myers, I know in the policy review meeting we had discussed how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| typically there would be also a procedure at some point with a policy like this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4837)|
| 1:20:41| and that there is a basic procedure within the policy toward the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4841)|
| 1:20:47| I think at that time you mentioned that you just wanted to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| some idea of what that process might look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4850)|
| 1:20:54| Given that this will likely end up having a procedure with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4854)|
| 1:20:57| do we need to retain a process within the policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4857)|
| 1:21:00| which then would therefore limit your ability to create a procedure in the future or shift it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4860)|
| 1:21:05| Does it make sense to not have anything related to the process in the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4865)|
| 1:21:09| and just have the procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4869)|
| 1:21:13| Thank you, Madam Chair, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4873)|
| 1:21:15| So I think that it, so what the steps contained in the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| really are sort of the bare bones skeleton of the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| and the law department was sort of involved, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| to make sure that we're kind of going through the right steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4887)|
| 1:21:31| If anything, the procedure that will accompany the policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4891)|
| 1:21:34| would simply be an expansion on how one would complete those steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| I do feel like we'll be in a good position to have that procedure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4899)|
| 1:21:44| not just shored up in writing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4904)|
| 1:21:46| but Ms. Jones and Ms. Wagner are already working with our IT department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| to get the online mechanisms in place, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| so that we're ready to implement if the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| if and when the board passes the policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4919)|
| 1:22:01| So I feel good about the pieces of the process that are reflected in policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4921)|
| 1:22:08| and I don't feel like, based on how we've written it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4928)|
| 1:22:12| that it would paint us into a corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| I was pretty purposeful in that part of the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4936)|
| 1:22:20| Thank you, and I appreciate in bullet point four the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4940)|
| 1:22:23| where I think there was an add to acknowledgement of financial responsibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| or somebody's private pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4947)|
| 1:22:29| I think the first version we saw was somebody had to prove insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| Can we see a version?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| I know it doesn't necessarily need to go to the public because this is a new policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4956)|
| 1:22:39| but for the board's purposes, between now and Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4959)|
| 1:22:42| can we see a version that shows any other changes that were made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| between policy review and this version?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| If the board has not already seen those changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| I will make sure it gets to you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| And maybe I've been sent it, but I haven't seen it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4972)|
| 1:22:54| So with the red line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4976)|
| 1:23:01| Ms. Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4981)|
| 1:23:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4982)|
| 1:23:03| If there aren't any more questions on that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4983)|
| 1:23:05| I'd like to go back to the release time for a minute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| so I can clarify where I'm looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4987)|
| 1:23:12| I'm looking at 492130G2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4992)|
| 1:23:17| and it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4997)|
| 1:23:18| in order to determine whether elective credit may be awarded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| for the student's completion of a release time course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5001)|
| 1:23:25| the local board of education shall evaluate the course in a neutral manner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| that does not involve any test for religious content| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5010)|

| 1:23:36| For purpose of the subsection G,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5016)|
| 1:23:38| the secular criteria used to evaluate a release time course may include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5018)|
| 1:23:43| the amount of classroom instruction time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| the course syllabus, which reflects the course requirements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5025)|
| 1:23:49| and any materials used in the course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5029)|

| 1:23:54| and whether the course was taught by an instructor licensed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5034)|
| 1:23:57| pursuant to Chapter 5 of this title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5037)|
| 1:24:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5040)|
| 1:24:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5050)|
| 1:24:12| So anything else on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5052)|
| 1:24:19| Mr. Duport, you look like you might have been ready to say something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| but no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| Did I misread you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5063)|
| 1:24:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5064)|
| 1:24:25| All right, just checking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5067)|
| 1:24:29| So seeing none.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5069)|

| 1:25:23| 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5123)|
| 1:25:31| Ms. Himmelgarn, would you like to speak just a little bit about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5131)|
| 1:25:35| because I know you and I have had some conversations about 12A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| and maybe what happened there and how we ended up with this on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5139)|
| 1:25:45| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5145)|
| 1:25:46| So attached to an email that you all received last week, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5146)|
| 1:25:50| was a memo from Mr. McPherson giving you some specific details,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5150)|
| 1:25:54| but we knew our federal allocation was going to be lower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| than it had been in the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5158)|
| 1:26:00| We weren't quite expecting the amount that we had heard earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5160)|
| 1:26:06| was a little bit less than the preliminary allocations that we received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5166)|
| 1:26:11| So with that, combined with the fact that we received it late| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5171)|
| 1:26:16| and we also know that most of our federal funding goes to our Region V schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5176)|
| 1:26:23| we wanted to give, the schools are aware of the allocations they would have received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| had we not proposed the general purpose budget covering the difference,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5186)|
| 1:26:31| but wanted to give them a little more time to figure out how to adjust their budgets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5191)|
| 1:26:35| so propose for one year we cover the difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5195)|
| 1:26:40| All right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| All right, so 12B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5203)|
| 1:26:51| And 12C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5211)|
| 1:26:57| All right, so Ms. Henderson, we have public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5217)|
| 1:27:02| Hi, today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5222)|

| 1:27:31| by going over the private practitioner's policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| I do hope that we do get the first vote this month on Thursday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5255)|
| 1:27:40| so that our kids can be ready to start school come August with their therapist with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5260)|
| 1:27:46| We are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| If there's any questions that board members may have, you know, regarding how it looks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5267)|
| 1:27:52| or any additional information you guys may need before the vote, feel free to reach out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5272)|
| 1:27:58| Just want to say thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5278)|
| 1:27:59| We really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5279)|

| 1:28:04| Nicole Shreve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5284)|
| 1:28:06| Did I pronounce your last name correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5287)|
| 1:28:08| Yay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5288)|
| 1:28:11| Just state your name, county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5291)|
| 1:28:13| You have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5293)|
| 1:28:14| Yes, Nicole Shreve, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| I'm a board certified behavior analyst with Positive Behavior Supports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5297)|
| 1:28:23| supporting kids here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5303)|
| 1:28:25| I have my own three children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5305)|
| 1:28:27| Actually, my one just graduated this year, but my other two children are in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5307)|
| 1:28:33| My purpose today was really just to be here to answer any questions that the board might have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| on the private practitioner agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| and really support everything that our group has been doing to ensure that our kids are getting services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5322)|
| 1:28:50| that they need and providing as much support to them as possible while they are in the school setting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5330)|
| 1:28:56| I just want to say thank you very much for hearing everything that we've had to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5336)|

| 1:29:10| Courtney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5350)|
| 1:29:11| I saw you back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5351)|
| 1:29:14| Welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5354)|
| 1:29:21| Courtney Piper, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5361)|
| 1:29:23| I wanted just to take a moment to thank Jason Myers and his team for putting together the private practitioner's policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5363)|
| 1:29:30| and responding to some of my suggestions and questions, so thank you very much for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| and also to encourage the board to pass this policy on first reading on Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| It would be tremendously beneficial, and just as a point of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| I received a letter of support for this policy from the medical doctor that diagnosed my son.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5385)|
| 1:29:51| It's very short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5391)|
| 1:29:52| I'll read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5392)|
| 1:29:53| It's from Dr. Deborah Christensen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| She is a medical doctor, board-certified developmental behavioral pediatrician,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| and she's at East Tennessee Children's Hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| To whom it may concern, I speak in favor of allowing trained ABA providers access to their patients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5403)|
| 1:30:09| who are students in Knox County schools to help ameliorate behavioral difficulties in children with autism spectrum disorder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5409)|
| 1:30:16| Applied behavioral analysis is the only evidence-based treatment for children on the autism spectrum with proven positive outcomes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5416)|
| 1:30:23| From my understanding, this is at the parent's expense and should be allowed as such other ancillary supports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5423)|
| 1:30:28| like private duty nursing or counseling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| Sincerely, Deborah J. Christensen, MD, FAAP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5430)|
| 1:30:35| So I've got that if it's helpful for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5435)|
| 1:30:38| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| Thanks, Courtney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| Lance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5442)|
| 1:30:47| Lance McColl, Knox County, Madam Chair, members of the board, thank you for letting me speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5447)|
| 1:30:54| I wanted to say a word about the proposed changes to policy B180 on public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5454)|
| 1:31:01| If the policy were in effect today, I wouldn't be able to speak to you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5461)|
| 1:31:06| because there is too little time between the time that people find out what's on the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5466)|
| 1:31:13| to be able to sign up reliably by 5 o'clock on Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5473)|
| 1:31:19| The policy would require that the people sign up during a business day, not 5 o'clock, 4 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5479)|
| 1:31:28| I think the agenda has come out on Wednesday night, is that right, Carl?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5488)|
| 1:31:35| Wednesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5495)|
| 1:31:36| This one, I think, came out late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5496)|
| 1:31:38| But even Wednesday, if you think about it, it comes out Wednesday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| It's got to get to the menus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| Somebody's got to notice it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| Somebody's got to notice it, know that it's available, and otherwise people aren't going to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5506)|
| 1:31:52| And if they can't sign up at the meeting, there's very little time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5512)|
| 1:31:58| If I were to find out about something, if I read it in the newspaper or even on Compass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5518)|
| 1:32:03| it would be the next morning, and maybe I don't read it regularly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5523)|
| 1:32:08| There's too little time for the community to be informed about what's on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5528)|
| 1:32:16| And I'll also say your agenda is very long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| So in order to figure out what's on the agenda, I have to read down and down and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5539)|
| 1:32:24| And there are probably fewer than a handful of people in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5544)|
| 1:32:30| who actually read your agendas that closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5550)|
| 1:32:33| So if you want to make sure that you don't hear from people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5553)|
| 1:32:37| this change that eliminates people signing up at the board meeting would be a good way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5557)|
| 1:32:42| So please don't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| Please still leave adequate room for the community to find out what's going on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5564)|
| 1:32:50| and sign up to speak in time to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5570)|
| 1:32:53| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5573)|
| 1:32:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| Madam Chair, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5580)|
| 1:33:02| So moving on to board forum, Ms. Deckard, and congratulations on your graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5582)|
| 1:33:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| I just wanted to also congratulate all the 2023 grads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| and just thank all the board members for such a wonderful time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| because this is my last work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| It's just been a pleasure working with all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5599)|
| 1:33:23| Thank you, Grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5603)|
| 1:33:24| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5604)|
| 1:33:25| Just want to add my congratulations to all the graduates and wish all of them well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5605)|
| 1:33:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5612)|
| 1:33:33| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5613)|
| 1:33:35| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5615)|
| 1:33:37| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5617)|
| 1:33:38| I should have given more time to really kind of think through my comments tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5618)|
| 1:33:42| but I went to three graduations and they were all amazing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| but I really want to hype Paul Kelly Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5626)|
| 1:33:48| maybe partly because that's where my son graduated this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| But if you've not been out and see what we do at Paul Kelly Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5632)|
| 1:33:56| I really encourage you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5636)|
| 1:33:58| It's our credit recovery program, and Megan Booth and Dr. Bodie out there are phenomenal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5638)|
| 1:34:04| and do tremendous work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| My son was on path to almost graduate when he was 20,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5646)|
| 1:34:09| and he went there for five months and did a year and a half worth of credits in five months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5649)|
| 1:34:14| And this was a kid who really had checked out of school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5654)|
| 1:34:18| and the reason he checked back in is because of the team that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5658)|
| 1:34:21| And you saw that in the graduation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| I mean, there was no hiding the emotion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| I mean, Megan Booth basically broke down, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5667)|
| 1:34:30| And that place was completely full, and I loved the air horns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| I mean, you know, everybody says, don't do the air horns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5673)|
| 1:34:36| They didn't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5676)|
| 1:34:37| They were air horn crazy because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| a lot of these kids who have gone through this program for lots of different reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| have experienced tremendous challenges in their high school years, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| And I'm thrilled that we have a program like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| I hate that it's just one hallway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5689)|
| 1:34:52| In some ways, that actually benefited my son because he has sensory processing disorder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5692)|
| 1:34:56| and part of the environmental challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5696)|
| 1:34:58| But I would love to see us be able to figure out how can we funnel more resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5698)|
| 1:35:03| to that program or replicate it in other parts of the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5703)|
| 1:35:06| I know that's one of the challenges is where it's located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| and from people in different parts of the district being able to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5709)|
| 1:35:12| But for some kids, that is going to be the only way they get through high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5712)|
| 1:35:17| And so I really appreciate the work of Paul Kelly and our team that's there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5717)|
| 1:35:22| and just thrilled with that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| And also, too, I'll speak to the Elevate program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| I know that's somewhere on here, I think, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| I love that we're doing that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| You know, finding those really unique pathways for certain kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| to be able to still navigate this period with all the other challenges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5737)|
| 1:35:40| that they might be facing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5740)|
| 1:35:41| So thank you all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5746)|
| 1:35:47| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5747)|
| 1:35:48| I always hesitate to call out specific groups of our kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5748)|
| 1:35:52| because we have so many talented academic accomplishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| and so many accomplishments in the arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| But I will say that the Farragut High School Boys Baseball Team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5759)|
| 1:36:03| won a second back-to-back championship, state championship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5763)|
| 1:36:08| and the Girls Softball Team came in second at state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5768)|
| 1:36:11| And I think golf came in third, but I'm not 100% sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| So anyway, congratulations to all those students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5776)|
| 1:36:22| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5782)|
| 1:36:24| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5784)|
| 1:36:30| Dr. Ryswick said about the graduations that I attended along with him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5790)|
| 1:36:38| and we got lucky at one point in the evening when a cloud came across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5798)|
| 1:36:47| No rain, but we got clouds for 90% of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5807)|
| 1:36:55| The other one was a morning, and it was getting warm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5815)|
| 1:36:59| but we got through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| And I just want to congratulate all the grads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5821)|
| 1:37:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5825)|
| 1:37:07| We didn't have any clouds Friday night for our evening one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5827)|
| 1:37:10| I'm just going to say it was pretty toasty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5830)|
| 1:37:13| We made it through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5833)|
| 1:37:15| So yes, and I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| So congratulations to all their grads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| And just again, I'd like to mention all those that signed up for the military| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| because we had talked about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5843)|
| 1:37:25| It was actually pretty amazing to see those recognitions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5845)|
| 1:37:29| as well as the National Honor Society and the Advanced Academics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5849)|
| 1:37:36| It was good to see so many different groups of students recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5856)|
| 1:37:42| So with that and nothing else, the meeting is adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5862)|
| 1:37:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-230606?start=5875)|
