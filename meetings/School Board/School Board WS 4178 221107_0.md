| 0:00:30| Welcome to the Board of Education's November 7, 2022 work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=30)|
| 0:00:38| Please stand as we observe a moment of silence, followed by the Pledge of Allegiance, led by Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=38)|
| 0:00:54| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=54)|
| 0:01:17| Thank you, Mr. Triplett. I believe we have Representative McKenzie in the audience tonight. Thank you for joining us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=77)|
| 0:01:26| Do we have any other elected officials here? I don't believe I have seen any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=86)|
| 0:01:32| Board members, a policy review meeting has been scheduled for Friday, November 18th at 9 a.m. in this summer place boardroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=92)|
| 0:01:41| I also believe we have some special guests here this evening. Ms. Henderson, would you like to introduce our Hardin Valley Academy students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=101)|
| 0:01:48| Yes, thank you, Madam Chair. I'm so excited that Ms. Sherrill is here with her class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=108)|
| 0:01:53| We have some students here from HVA Teaching as a Profession, and Teaching as a Profession is a four-course pathway designed for students who are interested in working in the education field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=113)|
| 0:02:05| The students here tonight are level three and four students. The Teaching as a Profession students are trained in classrooms as well as in the field to be our future teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=125)|
| 0:02:15| They are here tonight to observe how decisions are made on a district level, and we couldn't be more excited to have you guys here. Thanks for coming tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=135)|
| 0:02:22| Thanks for Ms. Sherrill for all she does for her students as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=142)|
| 0:02:33| Thank you, Ms. Henderson. Before we get started on our agenda items, I want to remind everyone in attendance tonight that the Board of Education's public meetings are the only opportunity we have to discuss items that would come before us as an elected body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=153)|
| 0:02:48| Please refrain from applause, cheers, groans, booing, and or conversations with others in the audience, as this can be very distracting during our discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=168)|
| 0:02:58| If you do feel the need to have a conversation with someone sitting next to you, we ask that you step outside to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=178)|
| 0:03:05| Any Knox County resident can sign up to address the Board during public forums, so please be mindful of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=185)|
| 0:03:11| And we certainly don't want to ask anyone to leave, but we do have to be respectful of our time and conversations as a Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=191)|
| 0:03:19| So with that being said, are there any requested changes to this agenda? Ms. Bight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=199)|
| 0:03:27| Yeah, if you'll turn it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=207)|
| 0:03:30| Thank you, Madam Chair. I would like to request a change. I motion to move Mr. Sam McKenzie, Representative McKenzie, which is somewhat in conjunction with the third grade retention resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=210)|
| 0:03:43| But we don't have to move that whole discussion, but just for timeliness on his part, to be moved up under the superintendent's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=223)|
| 0:03:53| So to add him to the agenda to speak outside of public forum? Yes. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=233)|
| 0:04:01| So we have a request by Ms. Bight to add Mr. McKenzie up to, you said under the superintendent's report right after that, and it's taken by Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=241)|
| 0:04:17| So is there any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=257)|
| 0:04:27| Okay. So all in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=267)|
| 0:04:42| So let's do a roll call vote. Ms. Kutton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=282)|
| 0:04:53| Mr. Bettler? Aye. Ms. Owen? Aye. Mr. Watson? Aye. Ms. Bight? Aye. Ms. Horn? No. Mr. Triplett? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=293)|
| 0:05:11| Mr. McMillan? No. Ms. Henderson? No. Ms. Christy? Pass. That's four yes votes, four no votes, and a pass vote. Ms. Christy, did you want to change your pass? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=311)|
| 0:05:27| So the motion fails. Okay, so do we have a motion to approve the agenda as it is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=327)|
| 0:05:40| So a motion by Mr. Watson, a second by Mr. McMillan. All in favor say aye. Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=340)|
| 0:05:50| All right. Superintendent Rice. Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board. I'll have some brief updates since our last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=350)|
| 0:06:00| I'd like to begin by saying thank you to Ms. Lindsay Lewis, a sixth grade math teacher at Cedar Bluff Middle School, for allowing me to spend half a day in her classroom with her last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=360)|
| 0:06:09| Ms. Lewis is a district-wide demonstration teacher who teaches, I said before, I think sixth grade math, who's really taken our Zurn curriculum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=369)|
| 0:06:17| I'd never seen it in action. I'd heard a lot about it, but it was great to be able to get out and see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| Was a fantastic teacher, let me stay through her bus duty first and second block, and I actually got to have lunch with the teachers as well with that sixth grade team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=381)|
| 0:06:28| A great time to be able just to answer questions they have and spend a little time seeing what things look like in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| So just left very confident with great teachers like Ms. Lewis in the classroom. I really think the needle's going to move for our students in math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=394)|
| 0:06:43| Again, she's phenomenal and the team there does a great job, so I just want to give her a shout out for letting me spend time with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=403)|
| 0:06:49| I'd also like to take a minute to acknowledge another successful coupon book campaign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=409)|
| 0:06:54| On Friday, I got the chance to attend the official coupon book celebration, which was held at Main Event, and recognize the district's top sellers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=414)|
| 0:07:02| Ms. Bella Courtney from Powell Middle School was the top overall seller this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=422)|
| 0:07:07| The campaign raised over $1.2 million. I think the goal was $1 million, so to have $1.2 million come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=427)|
| 0:07:13| And so this was just a great for our community to show how successful they can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=433)|
| 0:07:20| The students working hard and the parents to support, and the community also for buying those coupon books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| Also want to thank the folks who participated in that from the business sector, from the restaurants, to the merchants, to the other partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=446)|
| 0:07:33| It really makes a difference in the school. Just excited too, just so everyone knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=453)|
| 0:07:37| The books were $10. The full $10 went to the school, so there was no money that was taken back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=457)|
| 0:07:43| So the school it was purchased at, those dollars went back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=463)|
| 0:07:46| It was great to hear lots of folks that were thankful for that opportunity, but really we're thankful for the community at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| who continues to support that effort to bring in those dollars to our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| Finally, I just want to remind everyone that tomorrow is Election Day and students will not be in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| Teachers will be attending system-wide in-service meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| Thank you also to Chris Davis and the Election Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=485)|
| 0:08:08| We often forget to thank them because during election time we do share the building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| and we really work hard with them to make sure that we've given them what they need and the parking they need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=493)|
| 0:08:17| and the facilities that they need to do that. So we're appreciative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=497)|
| 0:08:20| They're always helpful for us to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=500)|
| 0:08:23| So please consider voting if you haven't already, and we look forward to seeing students back on November the 9th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=503)|
| 0:08:28| Madam Chair, that concludes my report for the evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=508)|
| 0:08:31| Thank you, Dr. Risely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=511)|
| 0:08:33| All right, board members, so moving into our regular session agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=513)|
| 0:08:39| are there any comments or is there any discussion on items 5A or B?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=519)|
| 0:08:53| Are we good? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=533)|
| 0:09:05| Item C, items and contracts, one or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=545)|
| 0:09:16| Three or four? Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=556)|
| 0:09:21| I'm sorry, Madam Chair. My question is actually about C1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=561)|
| 0:09:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| So, Mr. Risely, Dr. Risely, I know that there was, it even said in the report that we got,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=568)|
| 0:09:37| that there was a little bit of confusion, I think, at the beginning of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=577)|
| 0:09:41| It's probably fair to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| I think the district, and I don't know how many districts across the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| interpreted the law to just mean our classic libraries and schools, not individual classrooms themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=585)|
| 0:09:51| In that legislation, did Tennessee provide any additional funding for the effort that it's going to take to catalog classroom libraries?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=591)|
| 0:10:03| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=603)|
| 0:10:05| To my knowledge, and I look at Dr. Wilson because I didn't think we had, I wasn't aware of any, so they have not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| And if I could expand a little bit on the one, so we did report on that, that we were not in compliance with that law to date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=610)|
| 0:10:17| and you've done a good job framing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=617)|
| 0:10:19| Our understanding was that it was going to be for school-level libraries, and we were prepared and did comply with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=619)|
| 0:10:27| The classroom sets were not ones that we thought of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=627)|
| 0:10:29| so we did actually write on the board, too, a letter to the commissioner not wanting to put undue pressure on the teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=629)|
| 0:10:36| to be able to get that done and have that to where our goal now is spring break of next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| or excuse me, of the following semester to get that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| So if she received the letter and just said, make sure we report that as a compliance report, that we're not fully compliant with that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| But to our knowledge, there won't be penalties for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=648)|
| 0:10:51| Yeah, and from my understanding from the implementation that you all lined out, I thought that was pretty specific, which I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=651)|
| 0:10:56| But it sounds like there's going to be time and energy and effort, at least on software implementation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| We are probably going to be implementing some new platform to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=661)|
| 0:11:04| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| I'd probably defer to Dr. Wilson on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=666)|
| 0:11:08| He knows the details more than I do on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=668)|
| 0:11:11| Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=671)|
| 0:11:12| So, yes, there are several different, I think, options out there, tech platforms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| I know Dr. Reiswick had been to a superintendent's conference earlier in the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| and had several districts that had shared different examples of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| What Sarah Searles and her team have been doing is pulling librarians and teachers together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=683)|
| 0:11:29| and looking at different resources that are available and getting feedback from them about systems that would be the most beneficial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=689)|
| 0:11:34| and kind of efficient for doing that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=694)|
| 0:11:37| And so they've really been in that feedback collection phase right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| and trying to look at some different models that might work for that as they move forward, as I laid out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=700)|
| 0:11:45| And that was her timeline that she provided on those things in the compliance report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=705)|
| 0:11:49| Yeah, so there will be some additional calls both on the software implementation side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=709)|
| 0:11:53| but also labor side from teachers and or others who are helping to do that cataloging.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| Yeah, I don't know, obviously, the exact lift on that and certainly on the tools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| either the types of resources we would have to acquire to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| but I could certainly get more information on the directions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| Well, there's probably going to be some start-ups, some costs, and some ongoing costs long term, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| Potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=734)|
| 0:12:15| I think what we're seeing this as, like long term, is more kind of an inventorying process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=735)|
| 0:12:21| So that once we get it up and established, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| if we do have technological resources that we're using to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=744)|
| 0:12:27| it would just be a matter of updating that periodically at the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| Yeah, so the lift is probably more on the front end than ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| I think we think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=754)|
| 0:12:35| Yeah, and I don't want to add to that lift,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| but I think it would be good for the board and our legislators, honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=758)|
| 0:12:41| to understand some of what the cost is associated with that lift.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=761)|
| 0:12:44| I don't want to spend a tremendous amount of time trying to document time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=764)|
| 0:12:47| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| But I think it's good for our legislators to understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| I think there's always unintended consequences, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=771)|
| 0:12:53| I don't know that this law was passed with the intent of let's burden our teachers with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=773)|
| 0:12:58| but that's going to be a result of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=778)|
| 0:13:00| and I think it's important for us to be able to help tell that story in terms of Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| and what is the specific burden it's putting on our system in order to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=784)|
| 0:13:09| I'd be happy to do a capture on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=789)|
| 0:13:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| Keith, I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| The library collections at the school level, are those accessible to parents yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=797)|
| 0:13:25| or is that also available?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=805)|
| 0:13:27| Are you referring to the classroom library?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=807)|
| 0:13:30| Not the classroom library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=810)|
| 0:13:31| The school level to the school library.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=811)|
| 0:13:34| The school level libraries have been in compliance actually even prior to this law change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=814)|
| 0:13:38| Each school has a publicly accessible catalog that's searchable for that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=818)|
| 0:13:43| If you go to the main pages, typically at the top, under students or families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=823)|
| 0:13:48| you'll find a tab and it's usually there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| Yep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=831)|
| 0:13:58| Moving on to items and contracts, item two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=838)|
| 0:14:06| Item three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=846)|
| 0:14:14| Four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=854)|
| 0:14:21| Five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=861)|
| 0:14:27| Item six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=867)|
| 0:14:33| Seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=878)|
| 0:14:39| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| I had a question about this, the purpose of the original contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| and whether the partnership has been fruitful if schools are using it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=884)|
| 0:14:50| And also just, I think it sounded like that the data being shared will not be tied to students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=890)|
| 0:14:57| so I just wanted to make sure that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=897)|
| 0:14:59| And what the purpose of the amendment, just if you can explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=899)|
| 0:15:06| So there's two different questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=906)|
| 0:15:08| One would be the purpose of the amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=908)|
| 0:15:10| but then also just whether the original contract is being utilized by a school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=910)|
| 0:15:14| and whether it's been fruitful so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=914)|
| 0:15:16| because I think it's been around for just a little over a year or a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| So I tried to touch base today with Shannon Jackson a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| because she had a lot more history on this than I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=925)|
| 0:15:27| It appears, again, that the amendment to the contract is related into how we're sharing data with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=927)|
| 0:15:33| And I think, again, the contract in its original inception had to do with our schools that were participating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=933)|
| 0:15:40| with the literacy improvement network, the LEND network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| And so there was some data on the back end, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=944)|
| 0:15:47| that TNTP would need to show the impact of that work and those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=947)|
| 0:15:52| And, again, in talking with Shannon today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=952)|
| 0:15:54| it seemed like last year when we shared data at the end of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| that data share was with the state directly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| and that there's a change in that, that the data is actually going to TNTP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=961)|
| 0:16:05| through this contract and agreement rather than being passed through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| So I think that's the change with the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=969)|
| 0:16:11| I will call Dr. Phillips up, if you don't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| to talk a little bit about the schools that are currently working with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=975)|
| 0:16:17| because she had a chance to touch base with several principals today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=977)|
| 0:16:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=980)|
| 0:16:31| Oh, that button. Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| I had the privilege to talk to a few principals today about their work with TNTP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=995)|
| 0:16:40| Currently, we have five middle schools participating in the LEND work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1000)|
| 0:16:48| which is centered around literacy implementation within our high-quality instructional materials framework.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1008)|
| 0:16:55| And I spoke to Mr. Champion at Little Springs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| He spoke very highly of their collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1019)|
| 0:17:02| He said that with their support, they're doing instructional walkthroughs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| to look through the lens of how high-quality instructional material implementation is going in their building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| and really streamlining the work in alignment with their goals around literacy and improving literacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1032)|
| 0:17:20| So all of our middle schools that are participating in that work are walking a very similar path.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| I also spoke with Mr. Smith at Fulton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| So this is an additional lens of TNTP work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| He's partnered with TNTP over last year and this year, focused on math and ELA work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1052)|
| 0:17:40| that's grounded in his instructional goals for school-wide improvement and achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1060)|
| 0:17:47| He has specific on-site visits that happen there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1067)|
| 0:17:50| and he said that his administrative team has been wrapped in support through his partnership with TNTP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| and he feels like the work is extremely beneficial and invaluable to their work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| I also spoke with Ms. Foster at Maynard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1081)|
| 0:18:04| and she's partnered with TNTP as part of a turnaround support structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1084)|
| 0:18:10| to really invest in analyzing what the needs are at Maynard to see continued improvement opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| and to build their administrative team up in recognizing what high-quality literacy instruction looks like in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1096)|
| 0:18:24| And so she spoke very highly of their partnership and is excited about future collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1110)|
| 0:18:33| Thanks so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1113)|
| 0:18:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1114)|
| 0:18:38| So any more discussion on Item 7?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1118)|
| 0:18:43| Moving on to Item 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1123)|
| 0:18:49| Item 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1129)|
| 0:18:54| 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1134)|
| 0:18:59| 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| Ms. Warren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| Me again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1147)|
| 0:19:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1148)|
| 0:19:09| Question on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1149)|
| 0:19:10| I know this contract is always an issue for Gary, and I know you have not signed it, Mr. Dupler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1150)|
| 0:19:16| so I'm not sure if all the other board members are aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1156)|
| 0:19:19| So that's one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| I'm wondering, Mr. Wilson, if the IB program has been beneficial to Beard Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1160)|
| 0:19:28| if we've seen impact at Beard Middle or even at West because of that program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1168)|
| 0:19:38| Thank you, Ms. Warren.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1178)|
| 0:19:39| So, again, I think when you look at the assessment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| and I'll give Gary a chance to sign tonight if he wants to, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1183)|
| 0:19:46| I just always want to give him that last opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| But, no, I think when you look at sort of the, you know, what should we be looking for out of this model| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| between the middle years program and the IB program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| it really is about giving schools a framework to help students begin thinking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| and begin accessing those early post-secondary opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| So if you look at it through the lens more of, you know, students moving through the middle years program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1204)|
| 0:20:09| and into the high school IB program, it really would be, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| the place to look at most of the data would be in that college and career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1213)|
| 0:20:17| early post-secondary exposure type frame and lens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| In doing that, as I mentioned to you earlier today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1222)|
| 0:20:24| I did ask our REA department to go back and pull some information in regards to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1224)|
| 0:20:30| And if you looked back historically from 2016 to the last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1230)|
| 0:20:35| we've definitely seen pretty significant increases both in IB participation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1235)|
| 0:20:39| which is really the advanced model that they carry there, as well as the industry certifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| because West has started not only the diploma side of their program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1245)|
| 0:20:49| but now have added the career program, which is not that dissimilar, honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1249)|
| 0:20:54| from what we've talked about in the academy work of building out those pathways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| those defined course sets, and giving students that exposure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1257)|
| 0:21:01| So, again, seeing significant increases in student exposure to the EPSOs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1261)|
| 0:21:07| Their graduation rate, actually, if you looked back to 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| was about three and a half points below the district average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| It's now about a point higher in the last academic year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| A little bit of noise, if you look at that, as it was anybody else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1276)|
| 0:21:19| with that 2020, 2021, 2022, some fluctuations in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1279)|
| 0:21:23| But definitely, as you look at the trends over time, I think we've seen impact there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| The percent of students that are above the 21 on the ACT between 2016 and 2021 has increased over 7%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1288)|
| 0:21:35| So, again, I think if you're looking at the end range of how we begin to get students interested in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1295)|
| 0:21:42| and then plugged into appropriate academic work, I think there's some indicators there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1302)|
| 0:21:46| It's hard to prove causality with anything, but some indicators that over the past five, six years or so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1306)|
| 0:21:53| that they've seen some growth in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| Okay. Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1318)|
| 0:22:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| Looking at the fiscal note, it seems much lower than I recall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| and so I'm wondering if there are other costs associated, like staffing and scheduling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| and that kind of thing that are not included in this fiscal note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1331)|
| 0:22:17| I'm not aware of any specific additional staffing costs, but I am also pretty new to the IB world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1337)|
| 0:22:24| So I think if Shannon's here, I'll have her come on up and talk about that piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1350)|
| 0:22:33| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| Thank you, Madam Chair, members of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| So you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| Initially, there was some overstaffing to launch the Bearden Middle and West High School programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1363)|
| 0:22:50| but by the time Bearden Middle was coming on board, they had earned their staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1370)|
| 0:22:55| So they're within ratio of the other schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1375)|
| 0:22:59| So we really are down to $80,000 covers the fees for Bearden Middle and West High| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1379)|
| 0:23:04| and also gives the schools an allocation for professional development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| so that the teachers who are coming into the school or making a program change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1388)|
| 0:23:11| have an opportunity to get professional development for IB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1391)|
| 0:23:14| So we really are at a pretty good equilibrium as far as staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1394)|
| 0:23:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1399)|
| 0:23:21| Thank you, Ms. Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| So any other discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1406)|
| 0:23:31| Mr. Duport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| Since Ms. Horne mentioned it, I figured I would enlighten the board members as to why I haven't signed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1414)|
| 0:23:41| And I'll say this up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1421)|
| 0:23:43| I mean, there's a difference between me not signing and me saying, heck no, don't do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1423)|
| 0:23:49| which I would say positively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| But not in this case, because in this case, just like when IB came up the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| that there's no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| The program has an excellent reputation, and there's many fans of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1441)|
| 0:24:08| The only reason that our office is unable to sign on the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| is that it's just not in the form that we routinely accept for Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1452)|
| 0:24:18| So in other words, if something were to go really wrong with the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1458)|
| 0:24:24| then really Knox County Schools' recourse is to get out of the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| I mean, that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1468)|
| 0:24:30| Because our office, as much as I'd like to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1470)|
| 0:24:33| I mean, we're not going to travel to Sweden to fight it out in their court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| And there's a number of other issues, I mean, similar to that nature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| So that's why I haven't signed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| But the board has accepted the IB program in the past, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1487)|
| 0:24:52| And if the board feels like it's a good idea today, then you all have at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| I just wanted to give that caveat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1500)|
| 0:25:01| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1501)|
| 0:25:02| So, Mr. Dupler, I'm assuming that means the board has accepted in the past without your signature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1502)|
| 0:25:07| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1508)|
| 0:25:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| So any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| So moving on to Board Policy 6A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1517)|
| 0:25:23| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1523)|
| 0:25:24| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1524)|
| 0:25:25| I would just remind members of the board and the public that this change to our credit recovery policy is required by law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1525)|
| 0:25:32| because the law changed around how much credit could be given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1536)|
| 0:25:37| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1537)|
| 0:25:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| So moving on to Grant 7, Item A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1541)|
| 0:25:47| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1547)|
| 0:25:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1549)|
| 0:25:50| I want to make sure that I was reading it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| It sounds like maybe in the grant that last year was the first year we were able to offer school-based threat assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| I just want to verify that, that last year was the first year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1559)|
| 0:26:03| But I also want somebody to speak a little bit to the local match,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1563)|
| 0:26:06| and also I know there's some new things in there around implementing a gang prevention program and a community liaison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1566)|
| 0:26:12| So Ms. Chief here, can you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1572)|
| 0:26:19| Hello, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1579)|
| 0:26:24| So I can speak to the community liaison position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| The local match, Dr. Denton would be the expert on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| But as far as the community liaison position, this is a new approach that myself and Janice Cook came up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1592)|
| 0:26:42| The approach was to have a position that bridges the two divisions of the school district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1602)|
| 0:26:50| to ensure that we have community outreach for more parent contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1610)|
| 0:26:57| And I mean that by the position being something that goes out, does community response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1617)|
| 0:27:05| goes out and talks to parents about gang awareness, is a person that has directly reports to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1625)|
| 0:27:14| so that they'll be able to come back and tell me what are the concerns the community has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| And they'll also be out there to work with a report through to school culture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1639)|
| 0:27:25| to make sure that counselors have awareness training for gangs and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1645)|
| 0:27:32| So this came out of our strategy last year where we were looking at solutions around the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1652)|
| 0:27:38| for gang intervention and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| So this position is kind of the first time we've tried to bridge the security division and school culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| much like we did with the transportation safety officer position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| So it has a very unique reporting so that we can have a much more connected connection to the parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1673)|
| 0:28:02| and the school district as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1685)|
| 0:28:06| In the beginning I thought I heard you say to bridge the two divisions of Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1686)|
| 0:28:10| No, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1690)|
| 0:28:11| The position bridges both divisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| Okay, between Knox County Schools and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1695)|
| 0:28:16| And then is there any other elements to kind of a gang intervention program that we're implementing at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1696)|
| 0:28:21| Is there anything that's direct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1701)|
| 0:28:22| This person sounds like they're mainly integrating and connecting with the community at large,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1702)|
| 0:28:27| mainly through parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1707)|
| 0:28:28| But is there anything that's happening within Knox County Schools directly with students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| around gang intervention or prevention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1712)|
| 0:28:34| Yeah, so that person will help develop gang awareness training for both counselors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| our security folks, and with staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| So the person's going to be connecting all of those resources to the rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1724)|
| 0:28:49| But this staff member won't necessarily interact directly with students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| They could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1733)|
| 0:28:54| They could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1734)|
| 0:28:55| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1735)|
| 0:28:56| And is your department working at all with the police department or other entities within the community at large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1736)|
| 0:29:04| who are also doing gang intervention activities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1744)|
| 0:29:07| Are you all coordinating these efforts at this point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1747)|
| 0:29:09| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1749)|
| 0:29:10| This is something unique to our district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1750)|
| 0:29:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1753)|
| 0:29:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1754)|
| 0:29:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1755)|
| 0:29:16| Thank you, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1756)|
| 0:29:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| Any other discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| Moving on in grants, item B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| Item C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1771)|
| 0:29:38| Item D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1778)|
| 0:29:42| Mr. Watson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1782)|
| 0:29:44| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| I think I've got this question associated with the right grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1786)|
| 0:29:48| I may be off one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| Can somebody speak generally to the purpose of the grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| And I have a specific question about the logic model that's presented on page 8 around the whole child support team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1793)|
| 0:30:01| Ms. Cook, can you help me with this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1801)|
| 0:30:06| I hope so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1806)|
| 0:30:07| I guess first can you just speak generally to the grant and what you're hoping to accomplish with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| and then I've got a specific question about the logic model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| So this is a grant that was a pass-through grant from, I think, the Department of Health to the Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1813)|
| 0:30:22| And you sent out this grant, and it had three main components to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1822)|
| 0:30:28| You could apply for funding for making your school a trauma-informed school district-wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1828)|
| 0:30:35| which we did not really qualify for because we already have district-wide trauma-informed practices in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1835)|
| 0:30:41| The second component was that you could apply to expand the services that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| So we applied for some monies for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| And then the third one was to facilitate mental health supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| So we applied for that portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1854)|
| 0:30:57| So what you did with this grant was you sent in what you would like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| and they collected up all the people who had applied for the grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1860)|
| 0:31:04| You could apply up to a quarter of a million, which we applied for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| And then they said, depending on who applies, then we'll tell you how much money you get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| And then you have to go back and change what you've written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| So the person at the State Department, when I spoke to them, they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1875)|
| 0:31:20| this grant is a bit like I feel like I'm playing a board game with my children where they keep changing the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1880)|
| 0:31:26| So that's why if you look at the amount of the grant, it's a very strange amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1886)|
| 0:31:30| I don't know how they came up with that very strange amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| But then we had to go back and modify what we had done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| Couldn't really change anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1895)|
| 0:31:36| You just had to eliminate things under certain sections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1896)|
| 0:31:40| So that's what we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| We looked to say, for sections two and three, we are doing district-wide trauma-informed practices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1901)|
| 0:31:49| So let's look and see how we can focus, because this money is only available from now until June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1909)|
| 0:31:55| So it's short-term money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| What can we do to support some of our students to really target?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1917)|
| 0:32:02| So we looked at our homeless population, our foster children, and our ELL children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1922)|
| 0:32:09| So really for us, when we're looking at that second section, is what are we going to do to support those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1929)|
| 0:32:17| And we're going to work with community agencies to support those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| One of the things we had looked to do was provide translators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1941)|
| 0:32:27| At the end, they said, no, you have to take that back out of the grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1947)|
| 0:32:30| So we're going to work with our partners to see exactly how we can support best those three populations specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1950)|
| 0:32:37| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1957)|
| 0:32:38| I don't have the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| I didn't pull them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| But it looked like there was a pretty significant increase in our students experiencing homelessness and our foster students, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1960)|
| 0:32:47| I mean, pretty drastic increase over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| So I kind of geek out on logic models.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| I appreciate the work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1973)|
| 0:32:55| And I know that there's an output measure around the activities that speaks to the whole child support teams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1975)|
| 0:33:01| This is on page eight of the whole child support team row.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1981)|
| 0:33:06| I'll let you get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1986)|
| 0:33:09| So I don't know whether my—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| It's at least on page eight on my version of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1991)|
| 0:33:13| Yeah, it may not be on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| What does it say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| It's the logic model, and it's the row that speaks to the activity of the whole child support teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| which I know the board's had a lot of conversation about recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| There's an outcome measure in there in terms of reducing absenteeism by one percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| and reducing school suspensions by four percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| Is that—you're there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2016)|
| 0:33:37| So is this version of the grant, the stripped-down version, that you all have kind of renegotiated with the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| So this part, they just left this part as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| Okay, so this didn't change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| That was with the original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2028)|
| 0:33:49| All they wanted us to do when they stripped it down was take out people or take out things, but that was—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2029)|
| 0:33:55| We worked with Dr. Norton to put this together because this is seemingly, I think, a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2035)|
| 0:34:07| We'll see a lot of the grants from the state now having this model that you have to work through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2047)|
| 0:34:11| Yeah, and I've not been involved in a lot of state-level grants, so I'm not sure what their process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| But I know in some grants you have to produce a logic model up front, but you don't necessarily have to report on the back end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2055)|
| 0:34:21| Are we going to be required as a part of this logic model to report both our absenteeism and suspension data relative to this particular outcome metric?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2061)|
| 0:34:33| I do not know the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2073)|
| 0:34:35| I'm not sure that the state knows the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2075)|
| 0:34:38| We don't have how we're going to have to report out to that at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| Yeah, the reason I'm asking the question is because in our October board meeting we talked a lot about suspension data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2082)|
| 0:34:47| and we had a lot of conversation about perception of that in Knox County schools and with administrators and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2087)|
| 0:34:53| But we're obviously using that as a metric in some of our grant applications, including this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2093)|
| 0:34:58| And so I think more for the community than anything, I just want to—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2098)|
| 0:35:03| I wanted to try to understand if at least through this grant we're still tracking that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| and we'll be reporting on that at some level and what the expectation is for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| So part of the expectation for the chronic absenteeism, we're hoping that providing some support for students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2112)|
| 0:35:22| for these targeted groups, and also in the third component, which was providing someone to help support mental health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2122)|
| 0:35:33| and facilitation of that, that we'll be able to reduce some of these disparities that we have here with our suspensions and attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2133)|
| 0:35:47| Well, thank you. I just want to say again, I really appreciate you and your department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| and all the work that you guys are doing within Knox County schools and helping us meet our children where they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2150)|
| 0:35:56| So thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2156)|
| 0:35:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| Thank you, Ms. Cook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2159)|
| 0:36:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| So moving on to Item E.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2166)|
| 0:36:14| Item F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2174)|
| 0:36:20| Item G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2180)|
| 0:36:27| H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2187)|
| 0:36:32| I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2196)|
| 0:36:40| K.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2200)|
| 0:36:44| L.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| Moving into contracts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| Item A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| Item B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| Item C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| So this is a contract for our intercom installation and repair services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2229)|
| 0:37:15| I think most people feel like the phrase intercom is kind of outdated, like there's not many new implementations of intercom systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2235)|
| 0:37:21| I know that people use them in our school systems all the time now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| I'm just curious, from a technology standpoint, does Knox County Schools at some point see us getting away from a traditional intercom system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2245)|
| 0:37:35| Are we going to be leveraging other platforms in the future as new technologies get developed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| Dr. Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2261)|
| 0:37:45| I'm actually going to ask Freddie to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2265)|
| 0:37:49| Thank you, Mr. Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2269)|
| 0:37:53| Madam Chair, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2273)|
| 0:37:56| So this obviously is primarily for maintenance and support of the existing systems that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2276)|
| 0:38:02| Looking forward, yes, there are many innovations that we can look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2282)|
| 0:38:07| But part of our life safety plan, having some variety in how we communicate in the school is beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2287)|
| 0:38:13| So while we have individual phones in the classroom, we have electronic ways to communicate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| Sometimes it is best to have a traditional paging system that may work separately from some of the existing systems that we have, but integrate with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2299)|
| 0:38:30| So we want to have that available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| Should the Internet go down, we don't want the paging system to quit working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| So these systems offer us some variety to support what we have and then look forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| But right now, there is no plan to replace existing systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2323)|
| 0:38:47| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| I appreciate that, and I appreciate the way you articulated that and the need to have systems that are redundant that are acting on one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2328)|
| 0:38:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| Thank you, Mr. Cox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2339)|
| 0:39:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| Moving to regular agenda items, 9A, our enrolled academy charter school evaluation report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2343)|
| 0:39:14| Is this any discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2354)|
| 0:39:26| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2366)|
| 0:39:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| I know Mr. Diggs is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| I'm not sure if others are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2371)|
| 0:39:33| I'm wondering if somebody could speak just generally to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2373)|
| 0:39:36| So the copy of the report that we got just wasn't a good copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| It was kind of hard to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2379)|
| 0:39:41| And I'm not necessarily asking somebody to, like, come up and deliver a PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2381)|
| 0:39:45| But if somebody could summarize the report, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| Dr. Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| Yeah, actually, probably before I would call Steve up, which we'd love to have him come up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| But before I would do that, I'd ask Julie Thompson to come up and share her note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| Yeah, whoever's best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2399)|
| 0:40:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2400)|
| 0:40:08| So we completed this evaluation based on information from last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2408)|
| 0:40:15| And it runs from October 1 to October 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2415)|
| 0:40:19| And as you can see, the evaluation document has been revised from previous years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2419)|
| 0:40:28| The previous years, it had that one sheet that was very difficult to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2428)|
| 0:40:33| And so as part of our authorizer evaluation, because we have an evaluation for each individual school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2433)|
| 0:40:43| but then we're also evaluated as how well we are doing in authorizing charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2443)|
| 0:40:51| And so some of the feedback that we got from our evaluation was that that didn't work, that that wasn't a good tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2451)|
| 0:40:58| And so there was a committee that spent some extensive time revising the performance framework from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2458)|
| 0:41:06| And the document that you have before you now is the one that we utilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2466)|
| 0:41:12| So this is our first year using it, although we're using the same information to evaluate them this year that we did last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2472)|
| 0:41:23| But it is more detailed and gives you a lot more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| The good news is that Emerald has met all expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2488)|
| 0:41:33| Now, they are not unlike Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2493)|
| 0:41:37| They struggle with chronic absenteeism, and they had issues during the pandemic just like we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2497)|
| 0:41:45| But we have met with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| We had a site visit last week, and we've offered support to them, and they've been very open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2508)|
| 0:41:53| I'm very pleased with the relationship that we have forged with them, and they're very receptive to doing what's best for their children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2513)|
| 0:42:04| And so we're working hard to support them in whatever they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| So we have several departments that are working closely with Emerald to provide the support that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2528)|
| 0:42:17| Thank you, Ms. Thompson. That's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| It didn't feel like the same tool that we've gotten in the past, and so I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| And actually, the sheet that you all had last year is embedded in that document, but you can actually read it this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2544)|
| 0:42:32| because the template there is just a larger version, so you'll be able to see what the rubric is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2552)|
| 0:42:41| So this is more exhaustive. Is that fair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2565)|
| 0:42:46| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| Thank you, Ms. Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| So any other discussion on that item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2572)|
| 0:42:59| All right. Moving on to Item 9B. Ms. Byte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2579)|
| 0:43:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| I hope that everyone has had a chance to read this, and I've worked with Mr. Gary Dupler on this, who helped so much, as well as other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2589)|
| 0:43:20| And as a mother of a child that reading didn't quite click until fifth grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| this is something that is very close to me, but also now as a mother of a third grader who has never been through state testing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2606)|
| 0:43:35| also hits home for me, as well as knowing so many other parents that have third graders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2615)|
| 0:43:41| speaking to many third grade teachers, fourth grade teachers, fifth grade teachers about some of these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| And I've put this together, and I've also worked with Representative McKenzie, who is here, who I'd like to ask to speak on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2628)|
| 0:44:03| So we have him signed up. Did we sign him up? Okay, so he is signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2643)|
| 0:44:09| Yeah. He just has some information that might be pertinent to this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2649)|
| 0:44:15| Do we need to wait?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2655)|
| 0:44:20| So, since we took the vote at the beginning, I mean, I think if we asked to take a vote, it might end up in the same results, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2660)|
| 0:44:30| I mean, we can ask for, but since we've already done that, I don't know that the end result would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2670)|
| 0:44:36| Sure, I just thought it was a part of this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| Point of order, if I might. In the past, when a board member has had someone to speak on an item, that has never been denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2679)|
| 0:44:49| So it concerns me that that would be denied in this instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2689)|
| 0:44:56| Mr. Doopler, can you speak to that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2696)|
| 0:45:03| I don't know. I know that in the past, board members have requested individuals to come up and speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2703)|
| 0:45:10| I do not recall whether it's never been denied, so I can't confirm that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2710)|
| 0:45:18| But I do know that that's been allowed in the past when board members have requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2718)|
| 0:45:25| And then, obviously, if the board votes on it, then, but that, I think that's Ms. Christie's point, is that the board voted on it earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2725)|
| 0:45:34| So, you know, I don't know that I can shed much light on this one, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2734)|
| 0:45:40| It was my understanding that the vote earlier was whether to change the order and allow him to speak at the beginning of the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2740)|
| 0:45:48| because he was planned to speak on something that's much later in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2748)|
| 0:45:54| So that vote, I think we're voting on something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2754)|
| 0:46:00| And that's fair. I mean, I do feel like that is different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2760)|
| 0:46:06| And he has signed up to speak anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| So if there aren't any objections, I feel like we probably should go ahead and let him speak to this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2769)|
| 0:46:22| Well, we would hear him now and not at public forum. Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2782)|
| 0:46:27| So, I mean, if there aren't any strong objections, I do agree with Ms. Edwin and do think it would be appropriate to let him speak now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2787)|
| 0:46:37| All right. Representative McKenzie, thank you for joining us tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2797)|
| 0:46:43| Thank you. Thank you for allowing me to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| Dang, is it my voice tone, School Board Member McMillan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| No. Seriously, thank you all for allowing me to just spend a brief amount of time just talking about this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2810)|
| 0:46:58| You know, it's been a while since I've addressed this, August Boddy, but just for historical purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2818)|
| 0:47:05| I was first co-chair of the Joint Education Committee where we had half county commission and half school board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2825)|
| 0:47:13| So education is extremely important and valuable to me and has been being a product of Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2833)|
| 0:47:21| You know, and to cut to the issue, we had a special session in Nashville shortly after I took office to talk about education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2841)|
| 0:47:34| and what we were going to do, some really meaty issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2854)|
| 0:47:37| And one of them was this third grade retention process, and I really dug into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| And again, much to the chagrin of my party, the Democratic Party, I voted for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2862)|
| 0:47:48| So I want to be clear to you all, I voted for this when we were in session, and I support this in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2868)|
| 0:47:57| Now, will this adversely affect African American students and students of color?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2877)|
| 0:48:03| Yes, it will. I think the numbers will probably prove themselves out in Knox County and other places to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2883)|
| 0:48:11| But I think it's worth it. It's worth it in terms of not pushing our students on that really aren't reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2891)|
| 0:48:20| And there are several, several measures that are in place that's going to really help this third grade retention process move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2900)|
| 0:48:33| if done properly. And I have every confidence that you guys will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2913)|
| 0:48:39| Again, the benefits are worth it. Now, with all that said, and with my vote, and please go out and research it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2919)|
| 0:48:47| this resolution is a good one. Knoxville is not like Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2927)|
| 0:48:54| Knox County is not like Bledsoe County or Hardeman County or Morgan County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2934)|
| 0:49:00| You all have a responsibility to educate a bunch more students than most of those counties that I pointed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2940)|
| 0:49:08| All of those counties probably combine the counties. So things need to be different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| Things need to sit into your bailiwick. And so you all should and must be able to have some autonomy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2953)|
| 0:49:22| That's a lot of what I push. Governance should happen at its closest level to our students and our parents and our guardians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2962)|
| 0:49:32| And that's where you guys come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2972)|
| 0:49:34| We set a good template, but sometimes we don't get it right. I guarantee you, TISA, we didn't get it right the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2974)|
| 0:49:41| There's going to be some tweaks to it, just like this bill that we passed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| Again, I voted for it because it's a good bill. But this resolution is a good one as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2986)|
| 0:49:51| If you all have some tweaks to it, by all means, please make it Knox County doable and livable to be able to work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=2991)|
| 0:50:02| But the fact that you have no control over whether Johnny or Sally moves on, to me, makes no sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3002)|
| 0:50:11| You don't want that to be a blanket. Blankets rarely, rarely work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3011)|
| 0:50:16| So again, I didn't want to spend a lot of time on this, and I'm definitely willing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3016)|
| 0:50:20| I don't know if there's iterative process, but I definitely will stay here as long as I need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3020)|
| 0:50:26| But I just want to point that out and ask you all to really consider this resolution, passing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3026)|
| 0:50:32| Thank you, Representative McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3032)|
| 0:50:36| Reverend Butler, did you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| No, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3039)|
| 0:50:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3040)|
| 0:50:46| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3046)|
| 0:50:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3048)|
| 0:50:49| I just found the timing of this resolution a little politically driven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3049)|
| 0:50:54| The fact that it's coming up the night before an election.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| I suggest we move this to December and put it as part of our legislative priorities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3057)|
| 0:51:11| It looks like Mr. Watson, you were first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| Thank you, Madam Chair. I'm going to default to Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| I think she was kind of addressed in that comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3077)|
| 0:51:19| Ms. Byke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| I will say that I definitely, this was just the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3081)|
| 0:51:26| This was something that I've been working on for two months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| And I think we can go back through emails with Gary and other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3089)|
| 0:51:33| And it just so happened that this one happened to be close to election night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3093)|
| 0:51:38| I'd really like this to be something that we get taken care of so that we can all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3098)|
| 0:51:44| especially with the emails that I've gotten from parents, we can all kind of rest with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| So this is an issue that I've heard brought up a lot, even dating back to TSBA's conference last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3112)|
| 0:51:57| which is about to happen again next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| I believe this is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| Even TSBA at that point in time passed a similar resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3121)|
| 0:52:05| I know different delegates probably voted different ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| but the majority of TSBA delegates did pass and approve a very similar resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3128)|
| 0:52:14| I am curious about the now therefore language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| Ms. Pike, can you share who spoke to that particular language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3137)|
| 0:52:21| I just want to make sure that whatever that we're pushing, if this gets passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| and whatever we push to our legislators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3146)|
| 0:52:28| that the particular language around the information we would want to use to help make those decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| is specific and informed by our central administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| As far as specific information that we would use, that's something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3160)|
| 0:52:44| and that Mr. Dupler also brought up, that's hard to determine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3164)|
| 0:52:50| I think that even in the way we're seeing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| I'm open to that being collaborative in deciding what that needs to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3174)|
| 0:53:01| So the intent then of the resolution is not to spell out specific types of information we might use locally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3181)|
| 0:53:07| but to more just put it back in the hands of us locally to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3187)|
| 0:53:10| allow Knox County schools to use whatever information it deems necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3190)|
| 0:53:15| to make that decision for a given child or for all children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| All children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3199)|
| 0:53:21| Okay. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| I just want to be clear because I think the version that I read at TSBA was a little more specific,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3203)|
| 0:53:27| like it called out specific types of data we would have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| Yes. And I guess when I mean all children, I mean the data for all of Knox County children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3211)|
| 0:53:38| not just a specific subset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3218)|
| 0:53:40| So like the ELL students and students with IEPs and stuff like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3220)|
| 0:53:47| we know that we have plenty of students that are not diagnosed and don't have IEPs for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3227)|
| 0:53:54| and I want to make sure that we're including those students as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3234)|
| 0:53:58| Sure. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3238)|
| 0:54:00| And basically it sounds like the intent is that locally we would be able to take a whole child perspective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3240)|
| 0:54:05| and consider all the specifics around that particular child in making that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| and we would have more information or data about that specific child than just state-level data is the intent, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3250)|
| 0:54:16| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3257)|
| 0:54:19| Ms. Ellen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3260)|
| 0:54:22| I think it's really important that the board understands that when we're looking at the test data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3262)|
| 0:54:29| that determines whether a student would be retained,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3269)|
| 0:54:33| we're not looking at all of their TCAP scores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| This law requires that they are retained based only on their English language arts portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3276)|
| 0:54:43| which is just one tiny part of that test even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3283)|
| 0:54:47| So not only the first time that they're taking this test, but only that one little portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3287)|
| 0:54:54| So basically if we look at the over 1,000 hours a student would spend in school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3294)|
| 0:55:01| this little 30 minutes of their life is what determines whether they would be retained| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3301)|
| 0:55:06| with no input from the teachers or the parents or medical professionals or anyone else| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3306)|
| 0:55:13| who would be able to determine what intervention is actually needed if a student is having academic difficulty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3313)|
| 0:55:21| So when we're looking at this, we need to really understand that we're not looking at their test over all their subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3321)|
| 0:55:29| We're not looking at their performance over all their subjects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| This requires retention based only on that one little tiny portion of the TCAP test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3332)|
| 0:55:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3340)|
| 0:55:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3342)|
| 0:55:43| Ms. Byte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3343)|
| 0:55:44| I just also want to add that our third graders right now were kindergartners when the world shut down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| and they didn't get a full kindergarten year of normalcy, and my son is in third grade this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3350)|
| 0:55:56| and certainly watching him walk through this and some of the stuff that he's still struggling with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| and that this will be the first time he and his peers will have taken a test like this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3361)|
| 0:56:06| I don't know how he's going to do, and I don't know how the other third graders are going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3366)|
| 0:56:10| and this is the first class of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| So I think that is a special consideration as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3373)|
| 0:56:18| Reverend Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3378)|
| 0:56:20| I'd like to ask what is the impact, as the law stands, based on where we were last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3380)|
| 0:56:30| what the most recent data, how many, what percentage of our kids across the district would be retained?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3390)|
| 0:56:41| Thank you, Mr. Christie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3401)|
| 0:56:42| Thank you, Mr. Butler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3402)|
| 0:56:43| So typically we run around third grade, run around 40% proficient by these standards as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3403)|
| 0:56:50| And so if this were to be in effect, we're probably talking about 26 to 2700 students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| who could be affected in third grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3416)|
| 0:56:58| Now, again, the other side of that from the state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| so that means those students would have to either attend the summer session at a 90% rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3421)|
| 0:57:07| which is a 20-day session for like a summer bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3427)|
| 0:57:11| and or depending on how, not to complicate it too much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| but there's two kind of categories you fall into if you're not proficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| One would be below, and that's kind of the bottom of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3438)|
| 0:57:21| Those students would have to do both, attend a summer program, the summer bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3441)|
| 0:57:26| 18 of the 20 days, have to have 90% attendance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3446)|
| 0:57:28| and have a tutor in the fourth grade that would be with them during that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3448)|
| 0:57:32| If you're in that next level, which is approaching the level right under proficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3452)|
| 0:57:36| then it's an either-or choice for those families at that point to either attend the summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3456)|
| 0:57:40| or to do the tutor in fourth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| But we're thinking around, again, historically around that 40% range,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3463)|
| 0:57:48| so probably about 2600 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| And what I'm understanding is you're talking about what the current law is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| would be that number of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3478)|
| 0:58:01| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3481)|
| 0:58:02| Under the current law, the way the current law reads now about who would be, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3482)|
| 0:58:05| because it's every student who's not proficient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3485)|
| 0:58:07| and so those would be those two categories of students who aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| That's roughly about 60%, give or take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| in different years of our students in third grade who are not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3492)|
| 0:58:16| And so of those who would have to go through the summer school and other qualifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3496)|
| 0:58:21| how many of those, what percentage could be projected, based on your experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3501)|
| 0:58:27| to stay in the third grade?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| Well, so, and I may have Dr. Norton weigh in on this in a second too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3510)|
| 0:58:33| but so there's a couple things with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3513)|
| 0:58:36| So there's some things like the student would have to show improvement that's in the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| so pre-test, post-test, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3520)|
| 0:58:42| We don't have that test.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| The state would produce that test for us to be able to look at some of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3524)|
| 0:58:47| So we're not totally in control of the level of growth they would have to show over the course of the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3527)|
| 0:58:52| But if it were to be just attending those, that would be based on, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3532)|
| 0:58:59| let me say it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3539)|
| 0:59:00| I say last year there wasn't a great attendance in all of our summer camps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3540)|
| 0:59:03| and we weren't required to be as stringent on the attendance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3543)|
| 0:59:08| So this law lays out very specifically 90%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3548)|
| 0:59:11| So this past summer when students may have attended Summer Bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| they may have missed three days or four days,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3554)|
| 0:59:17| and we were fine to have them come back in to get the intervention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3557)|
| 0:59:19| I think this year it's much more stringent as far as if you fall into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3559)|
| 0:59:24| If you do miss over, if you don't attend 90% of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| then you would not be able, and it wouldn't count, you'd be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3567)|
| 0:59:30| So this law, as it's currently written, does not give us wiggle room outside of those two contingencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3570)|
| 0:59:36| Dr. Norton, I don't know if you'd add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3576)|
| 0:59:41| The only thing I would add is that it's really going to be dependent upon students having access to the interventions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3581)|
| 0:59:47| so the summer school and the tutoring, and then how effective those are over the course of the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3587)|
| 0:59:53| and then how the Department of Education decides to define what adequate progress is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3593)|
| 0:59:59| So that's the last piece we're looking for in terms of guidance from the department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3599)|
| 1:00:04| is that definition of adequate progress that would determine whether or not a student who has gone through those interventions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3604)|
| 1:00:10| meets the criteria for advancement to the next grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3610)|
| 1:00:15| And one last thing. Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3615)|
| 1:00:17| One last thing. So those students who are retained in the third grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3617)|
| 1:00:23| do you anticipate, based on the current law, that it would be more than what has been in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3623)|
| 1:00:28| and that would complicate your student enrollment in the third grade across the district, perhaps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3628)|
| 1:00:36| Thank you, Mr. Bowler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3636)|
| 1:00:37| I mean, again, not having gone through this yet, but I think your logic is smart, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3637)|
| 1:00:44| I mean, you've got a group identified. We've never identified 2,600 third graders to be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3644)|
| 1:00:49| I mean, typically the situation that was described earlier about kind of that local control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3649)|
| 1:00:55| looking at multiple data points, having input from teachers in the school about where the student is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3655)|
| 1:01:01| retention has not been a strategy we've used in Knox County schools for students to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3661)|
| 1:01:07| So we usually, that number is quite low that we do retain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3667)|
| 1:01:10| We do on certain times do that, but it's not at the rate of 2,600 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3670)|
| 1:01:17| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| I just had a question in reference to what Ms. Owen said about she made it sound so simple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3681)|
| 1:01:29| that like anybody could just look at it and decide whether it applied or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3689)|
| 1:01:41| But is that true, or do they use teams, or who actually decides?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3701)|
| 1:01:54| Thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3714)|
| 1:01:55| As the law is currently written, it is based on that TCAP score that is in English language arts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3715)|
| 1:02:01| So for third graders who are not proficient on that test, when those scores come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3721)|
| 1:02:06| it is if they weren't proficient, then they would be retained unless they choose one of these two interventions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3726)|
| 1:02:12| or in some cases they score low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| So there is kind of that, in the law, prescribed cut of where that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3734)|
| 1:02:19| Okay. I understand that makes total sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3739)|
| 1:02:23| But, you know, I think we can all agree that we're for anything that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3743)|
| 1:02:32| any program that would teach people to read as far as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3752)|
| 1:02:39| and they shouldn't go past the third grade before they have conquered that, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3759)|
| 1:02:48| Because if you can't read, you know, you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| It limits you on so many other things that you can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3774)|
| 1:02:58| So you need to learn to read adequately before you move on, in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3778)|
| 1:03:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3785)|
| 1:03:06| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3786)|
| 1:03:08| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3788)|
| 1:03:09| First, Representative McKenzie, thank you for coming and speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| It really helps me to know that you voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| I don't know that I would have guessed that for a lot of different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| So I appreciate you sharing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| And I'm not trying to – my assumption is that one of the reasons why this law got traction is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3800)|
| 1:03:26| it's basically an opportunity to encourage very strongly for parents to take initiative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3806)|
| 1:03:33| with their students based upon where they are, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3813)|
| 1:03:36| Because it's not they're just retained like you articulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3816)|
| 1:03:39| It's they will be retained if now you don't do this, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| And so it's – for right or wrong, it's a way to motivate parents to take action in the life of their kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3822)|
| 1:03:48| And from what I understand about this proposed resolution is this resolution doesn't speak to any of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3828)|
| 1:03:54| It really just speaks to what is the information we're able to use to make the decision whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3834)|
| 1:04:00| or not a child is going down that path of possibly being retained and or needing these interventions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| And I think the premise that – and Ms. Byke, you can correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| I think the premise that she's using is that certainly our educators locally would know better for each individual-specific child| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3850)|
| 1:04:18| if they have the capacity and the aptitude to do just what Mr. McMillan is saying, which is read at a third-grade level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3858)|
| 1:04:25| So, Dr. Reisman, Mr. Butler brought out, I think, some good logistical concerns about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3865)|
| 1:04:32| what would it mean if we retain, let's say, even 500 third-graders, you know, next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| Can you speak to – from an educator's perspective and also the superintendent of this district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3877)|
| 1:04:43| can you speak to your feelings not about the specific resolution but about the need for us to have some more autonomy locally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3883)|
| 1:04:52| to be able to make that decision and set that bar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3892)|
| 1:04:54| Do you feel like that's important or do you feel like relying on the current law the way it's worded from just TCAP scores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3894)|
| 1:05:01| does that – will that – do you think that will work and have the desired effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3901)|
| 1:05:04| I think this is like a lot of different laws and nobody can fully understand what all those unintended consequences are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3904)|
| 1:05:10| but I think there will be some unintended consequences, and I think that's probably what the point is being raised tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3910)|
| 1:05:16| So –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3916)|
| 1:05:17| No, thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3917)|
| 1:05:18| I think – let me say this first and then I'm going to answer the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3918)|
| 1:05:22| You know, 40 percent proficiency, even though it's the highest of all the urban districts, is not acceptable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3922)|
| 1:05:27| and we know that and we've made that clear and you guys have as a board as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3927)|
| 1:05:31| So, you know, we do need to continue to come up with strategies to work on that, and I think we will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3931)|
| 1:05:37| So I think you articulated well what my understanding from what the legislators were trying to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| and I think Representative McKenzie said the same thing in his talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3941)|
| 1:05:45| So I think we've seen the state be pretty stagnant for a long period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| and I think this was exactly what you're alluding to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| Retention in and of itself is – has no research to show that it is a strategy that students get better at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| Just a student being a year older doesn't all of a sudden make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3959)|
| 1:06:03| So I think that is what they were intending, was that it's probably the stick or the teeth in the movement to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3963)|
| 1:06:11| these early interventions are where the best shot for students are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3971)|
| 1:06:15| And so I think both of the things you just named, you know, the tutoring and the summer kind of bridge program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3975)|
| 1:06:21| with those extra days to work on skills, I think that's kind of where the best shot for those students is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3981)|
| 1:06:26| So I do think that was the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3986)|
| 1:06:28| I do think that the legislators, again, Representative McKenzie said that as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3988)|
| 1:06:33| that's what they were looking at when they voted for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| I have heard from Representative McKenzie and other representatives, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=3996)|
| 1:06:40| that say that they understand some of the things that you're alluding to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4000)|
| 1:06:44| that there are other consequences that could come from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| And I totally expect from my conversations with them that they will take this back up in session at some point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4007)|
| 1:06:51| and look at some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4011)|
| 1:06:53| I don't know how that will play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4013)|
| 1:06:54| We never know how that plays out when those things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4014)|
| 1:06:56| But I've heard from multiple ones who are listening saying they're hearing and seeing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| So I would say, again, back to the stance, retention in and of itself is not a research-based strategy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4021)|
| 1:07:08| that makes people better at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4028)|
| 1:07:09| So I don't know that we need a state law to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4029)|
| 1:07:12| I do think we need earlier interventions and we do know things to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| I think when other states, I think Mississippi and Florida are two other states that have done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4036)|
| 1:07:21| I haven't read their studies, but I have been told that it does do just what you've alluded to there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4041)|
| 1:07:28| that families do tend to say, we don't want our students to be retained, so we do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4048)|
| 1:07:33| Maybe we don't go to Disney World, we do this, that kind of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4053)|
| 1:07:36| Is that good or bad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4056)|
| 1:07:37| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4057)|
| 1:07:38| If their reading percent has gone up, I haven't studied that to see that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4058)|
| 1:07:41| but it feels like that's kind of the model that Tennessee is looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4061)|
| 1:07:44| So, again, I applaud that the state is providing those extra resources for us to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| I don't know that retention is the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4069)|
| 1:07:51| And to tell you the truth, we won't know until the end, so it's hard for us to plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4071)|
| 1:07:55| I mean, I think if this law doesn't change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| our hope would be that families do take advantage of one or both of those interventions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| so their student is not retained because it could, if no one went,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| it could cause some interesting challenges on, you'd have smaller fourth-graders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4085)|
| 1:08:09| smaller fourth-grade classes, larger third-grade classes, and those sorts of things that could play out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4089)|
| 1:08:15| So would it to that degree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4095)|
| 1:08:16| I don't know because we haven't been through it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4096)|
| 1:08:18| Yeah, so I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4098)|
| 1:08:20| I think we all want parents to take that initiative or other caregivers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| So for me, it was my grandmother.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4104)|
| 1:08:25| Like, I went to kindergarten twice because the first time I didn't learn the ABCs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4105)|
| 1:08:29| and my grandmother said you are during the summer, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4109)|
| 1:08:31| So she made it happen for me, which was great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4111)|
| 1:08:34| So the one part of the question that I'm not quite sure that you touched on was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4114)|
| 1:08:37| do you believe it's important for our local district to be able to have more autonomy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4117)|
| 1:08:42| in deciding how that child is assessed against the bar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4122)|
| 1:08:47| or is TCAP sufficient alone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4127)|
| 1:08:51| Good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4131)|
| 1:08:52| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4132)|
| 1:08:53| So I would say, you know, I think we need to make sure that we have good data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| to make those decisions on if that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4138)|
| 1:09:01| And I think, you know, what we've described right now at a local decision is what we currently have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4141)|
| 1:09:06| I mean, that's what we do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4146)|
| 1:09:07| We look at the data, we look at the student, look how they're performing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4147)|
| 1:09:10| and we make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4150)|
| 1:09:11| So I think to do that or if this resolution were to influence the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4151)|
| 1:09:16| I think we would go back to where we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4156)|
| 1:09:18| So I do think our local teachers and our principals, I mean, they have data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4158)|
| 1:09:24| We have sufficient data to make those kinds of decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4164)|
| 1:09:26| And, yeah, I think that's a good decision to have multiple data points to be able to make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4166)|
| 1:09:34| Ms. Selland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4174)|
| 1:09:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4175)|
| 1:09:36| Dr. Roslick, if I remember correctly, the funding for the bridge camps came from ESSER money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4176)|
| 1:09:42| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4182)|
| 1:09:46| Is there any provision for what happens when that ESSER money runs out is the first part of my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4186)|
| 1:09:53| And is there anything in the law that would provide for the 130 or so more teachers we would need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4193)|
| 1:10:00| if we retained these 2,600 students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| Thank you, Ms. Selland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4204)|
| 1:10:05| Good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4205)|
| 1:10:06| I may refer to Dr. Norton and or Ms. Himmelgaard to make sure on the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| There were provisions when this law passed that the state would continue to fund the summer bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4211)|
| 1:10:16| for those students in third grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| And I believe, if I'm not mistaken, it's third through eighth, but Liz, correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4218)|
| 1:10:23| So I think that provision stays there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4223)|
| 1:10:25| I don't know, again, back to the, you know, if students were retained and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4225)|
| 1:10:30| Typically in an elementary school, then you move the teachers to where that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4230)|
| 1:10:36| So if you had, just making this up, if you had six third grades and only three fourth grades,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4236)|
| 1:10:41| you would have more third grade teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4241)|
| 1:10:43| It would probably be the same number of students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4243)|
| 1:10:45| So I would imagine there may be some, you know, pluses or minuses that would come in staffing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4245)|
| 1:10:49| But to my knowledge, there's not additional dollars given for the retention of itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4249)|
| 1:10:53| Dr. Norton, you may want to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| If I could add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4255)|
| 1:10:56| Oh, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4256)|
| 1:10:57| My thinking is that initially, yes, that would be true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4257)|
| 1:11:00| But over time, those students will continue to be a grade behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4260)|
| 1:11:04| So over time, the teacher numbers are going to massively increase if those were all retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4264)|
| 1:11:11| And is the funding that has been provided by the state adequate to cover all the staff we would need for bridge camps if all of those students attended?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4271)|
| 1:11:23| Again, I'm going to refer to Dr. Norton in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4283)|
| 1:11:26| I believe the funds are there for, because we get based on the students who qualify for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4286)|
| 1:11:33| We get a dollar amount for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4293)|
| 1:11:35| And I would say this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4295)|
| 1:11:36| No, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4296)|
| 1:11:37| I mean, at some point this starts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4297)|
| 1:11:38| The law, the current law that's written only allows for one retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4298)|
| 1:11:41| So if you're retained in third grade, you wouldn't be in fourth grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4301)|
| 1:11:44| If you move on to third grade, even with the interventions, you can be retained in fourth grade if not missed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4304)|
| 1:11:48| But it's a one time retain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4308)|
| 1:11:49| But there would be some bottlenecking, I would think, in those middle years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| So, Dr. Norton, if you would want to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| The law states that in 23-24, the Learning Loss Bridge Camp transitions from its current middle school camp to a rising fourth grade through eighth grade camp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4315)|
| 1:12:06| The early elementary camp ends at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| And then the law also states that the funding for that camp continues sort of until they modify this law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4329)|
| 1:12:17| The funding section indicates that it would be funded from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4337)|
| 1:12:24| the LEAP grant, and other funds as appropriated by the General Assembly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4344)|
| 1:12:29| which means that that is funding that would be allocated annually as part of their budget setting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4349)|
| 1:12:36| So we could anticipate that we would have the funding to run the summer Learning Loss Bridge Camp based on that legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4356)|
| 1:12:45| and the way that it's worded right now, because that is also a reimbursement program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| So we get funded for the students who attend the camp at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4370)|
| 1:12:53| So if they ran it the same way, it would be funded the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| There is nothing in the law that indicates any funding for additional staff related to retention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4376)|
| 1:13:03| I think we'd be most likely to see the impact of that on staffing needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4383)|
| 1:13:08| For most of these students, they would end up probably retained in fourth grade if they didn't meet the interventions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4388)|
| 1:13:14| not in third grade because the interventions run through the fourth grade year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4394)|
| 1:13:19| So the most likely impact would be when that initial class transitions to high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4399)|
| 1:13:24| So we would see a year where there were less students in the high school population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4404)|
| 1:13:28| and then the following year an increase in that high school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4408)|
| 1:13:31| That's probably the place that would hit most, I would say, dramatically, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4411)|
| 1:13:38| in terms of the difference in staffing needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4418)|
| 1:13:42| Thank you. On the TANF funds, does it say that it definitely will cover that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4422)|
| 1:13:49| or that it can come from TANF funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4429)|
| 1:13:52| My very loose recollection is that it was TANF funds that were left over that could be used for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4432)|
| 1:14:00| So that could change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4440)|
| 1:14:02| So the way that it's worded is that it must be funded from the TANF funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4442)|
| 1:14:08| the LEAP grant funds, and other funds appropriated by the General Assembly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| So they must appropriate additional funds? Is that the way you read that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4452)|
| 1:14:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4457)|
| 1:14:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4458)|
| 1:14:20| Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4460)|
| 1:14:21| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4461)|
| 1:14:22| Mr. Myers, can you kind of speak to us about – sorry to put you on the spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4462)|
| 1:14:27| I think we've talked about this a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| I think there's been some confusion on who's exempted, are there exemptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| I don't think that information has gotten out there a lot to the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| Can you speak to that a little bit, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| Yes. Thanks, Madam Chair. Thank you, Ms. Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| So in terms of exemptions, the law, as it was written, only listed a handful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4484)|
| 1:14:51| And as we went through and worked – it's been months ago at this point –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| on a board policy amongst this body to reflect the change in the state legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4495)|
| 1:15:00| we were really clear that federal law trumps what was passed by the state legislatures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4500)|
| 1:15:06| So in our conversation at that time, we talked about not being discriminatory in our retention decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4506)|
| 1:15:12| So with that being said, a student with a disability or suspected of having a disability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| once a determination is made that a child is suspected of having a disability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4518)|
| 1:15:24| the umbrellas provided by those federal laws trump what is in the state legislation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4524)|
| 1:15:30| meaning that an IEP team or a 504 team would be able to make a decision to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4530)|
| 1:15:37| no, this child is not going to be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4537)|
| 1:15:41| We would love for them to still come to the camp and get the additional intervention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4541)|
| 1:15:45| but we would not want to retain a child who had a disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4545)|
| 1:15:48| or was suspected of having a disability that directly impacted their reading ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4548)|
| 1:15:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4556)|
| 1:15:57| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| Okay, I have a comment first, but Mr. Myers to follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4558)|
| 1:16:02| So I know I've heard a couple of people talk about if a child is suspected to have dyslexia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4562)|
| 1:16:10| but that that's not identified until perhaps the end of the third grade year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| Is that typically what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4574)|
| 1:16:17| It takes like through that third grade year to really identify those students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4577)|
| 1:16:22| Thank you, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4582)|
| 1:16:23| I think that's a good question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| The short answer is no, it shouldn't take that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| So if, for example, a student is identified as having characteristics of dyslexia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4588)|
| 1:16:34| that does not mean necessarily that they have dyslexia| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| or that a team is going to meet to determine that they need to be evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4598)|
| 1:16:42| So the key component here is that a student support team be convened and a determination be made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4602)|
| 1:16:48| Again, we don't suspect a child of having a disability until the team has met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4608)|
| 1:16:53| and articulates that that child should be evaluated for a disability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4613)|
| 1:16:57| So if a child has the characteristics of disability or if a parent wanted to call a support team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4617)|
| 1:17:04| or if a whole child support team decides that we need to dig deeper into that child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| that's the team that makes a recommendation to have the student evaluated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4629)|
| 1:17:13| Once the decision is made to have the student evaluated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4633)|
| 1:17:15| then they are quote-unquote suspected of having a disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4635)|
| 1:17:19| and would be covered under the umbrellas of those two pieces of federal law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4639)|
| 1:17:24| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| Okay, and then my comment was really back to what Ms. Henderson talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4645)|
| 1:17:30| the fact that we will look at our December legislative priorities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| or our legislative priorities for next year in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| I think it would probably be more effective to look at this at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4657)|
| 1:17:41| I would really like to have, I know Dr. Norton has spent a lot of time on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4661)|
| 1:17:47| and so I would really like to have her expertise in what should we be asking the legislature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4667)|
| 1:17:53| to identify as those exceptions or the other data points, whatever those things are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4673)|
| 1:18:00| Because I think, like Dr. Reiswig, I've spoken with legislators who are pretty sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| that this will probably be tweaked when they get into session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| So I feel like they're open to it, there's room for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| So I think that it would be wise for us to have the verbiage basically in agreeance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4694)|
| 1:18:23| that we agree that third graders need to be able to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4703)|
| 1:18:27| However, we feel like we need to have some more local control,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4707)|
| 1:18:30| and these are the points that we would like to see as considerations in the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4710)|
| 1:18:35| Because you've been working on this, you have experts available to you to weigh in on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4715)|
| 1:18:43| So I feel like we have the opportunity in our legislative priorities to really articulate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4723)|
| 1:18:48| and hopefully they can get to a point that will be beneficial for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4728)|
| 1:18:54| and also will really also satisfy the spirit of what they're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4734)|
| 1:19:02| So that's what I would prefer, is to have something that Dr. Norton can weigh in on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4742)|
| 1:19:08| as part of our legislative priorities that we review in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4748)|
| 1:19:14| Reverend Butler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4754)|
| 1:19:16| Yes, a question and then a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| The question I have is, just to make sure I'm hearing Dr. Reiswig,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4758)|
| 1:19:28| just a few weeks ago, I think, we heard that the number of schools we have that's on this list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4768)|
| 1:19:38| and I know at least two of the elementary schools in District 1 is on the lowest part of the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4778)|
| 1:19:45| One has come up a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4785)|
| 1:19:47| How many other schools in the district are on the list of some way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4787)|
| 1:19:52| And the second part of that question is, is that TCAP score the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4792)|
| 1:19:59| or a major reason why they're on the list?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4799)|
| 1:20:06| So to the first one, and Dr. Norton, check me on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4806)|
| 1:20:08| I think we have four CSI or priority schools that are shown in the bottom 4%, and you're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4808)|
| 1:20:15| So having four in the region that they're in or in the district that they're in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4815)|
| 1:20:20| I think the number on like targeted or there's different federal language on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4820)|
| 1:20:27| but they're basically schools that maybe a identified subgroup is not performing where it needs to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4827)|
| 1:20:33| I think it's like, I want to think we had 20, is it that much, Dr. Norton, do you remember?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4833)|
| 1:20:39| Okay, Dr. Wilson's looking too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4839)|
| 1:20:41| So I think, but it's so, so your priority is obviously one that is just like bottom five achievement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4841)|
| 1:20:46| compared with everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4846)|
| 1:20:48| And then you have like two other groups of those that are kind of targeted for additional interventions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4848)|
| 1:20:54| and that's like if a student group is performing in the bottom 5%, if it was a standalone school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| like that's one way to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| So those are, all of it is critical, but those priority schools that are in the bottom 5%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4861)|
| 1:21:09| are the ones that were kind of the state list's highest priority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4869)|
| 1:21:12| The targeted schools for different kinds of interventions, those are typically the ones that are some dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4872)|
| 1:21:16| you can roll back on and off of those, and we'll see that list change from time to time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4876)|
| 1:21:20| So have I stalled long enough to give you time to get a number, guys?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4880)|
| 1:21:24| I'll see if Dr. Norton has that number for you to be sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4884)|
| 1:21:29| Yes, we have 29 combination between the CSI, our ATSI, and our TSI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4889)|
| 1:21:37| Those go onto the list for different reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4897)|
| 1:21:40| So our CSI is for overall accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4900)|
| 1:21:45| Our ATSI and TSI is dependent upon their different subgroup data,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4905)|
| 1:21:49| and so all of the different schools on there might be on there for different reasons or different groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4909)|
| 1:21:54| And included within those accountability measures is achievement data as well as chronic absenteeism and grad rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4914)|
| 1:22:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4922)|
| 1:22:06| I have a great concern about retention because retention affects more than just grades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4926)|
| 1:22:15| And I do also agree with Dr. Razick that retention is not a model for teaching kids how to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4935)|
| 1:22:26| I agree with Mr. McMillan that you need to be able to read by the third grade to be successful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4946)|
| 1:22:32| but if you can't read in the third grade, staying in the third grade may not make you successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4952)|
| 1:22:37| It may make it even more challenging for someone to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4957)|
| 1:22:43| And I know, I believe, based on the information that I have, that it would affect District 1 in a great way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4963)|
| 1:22:53| just because of what we've heard about the schools on the list.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4973)|
| 1:22:57| But also I believe it's going to hurt the district in a great way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4977)|
| 1:23:00| And I believe the best way for the district to deal with it is to have more autonomy to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4980)|
| 1:23:06| If that means taking time to take a look at it and have the legislative committee look at it, that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4986)|
| 1:23:15| but I think that if we don't look at it from a district perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=4995)|
| 1:23:20| that what can we do along with being in compliance with the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5000)|
| 1:23:25| But the way it stands right now, our hands are tied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5005)|
| 1:23:30| We don't have a lot we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| But I think if this resolution or a resolution like this was in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5012)|
| 1:23:38| then we would give our superintendent and staff more opportunity to have a bigger impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5018)|
| 1:23:46| So I'm for a resolution to give us the autonomy to do the best we can with what we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5026)|
| 1:23:53| and making sure that our kids can read by the third grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| If they can't, we have a plan that's going to be more effective than just holding them back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5036)|
| 1:24:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5044)|
| 1:24:05| Ms. Elwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5045)|
| 1:24:07| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5047)|
| 1:24:08| Dr. Ryslick, do we have any idea what would happen if TCAP scores are not available at the end of the year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5048)|
| 1:24:18| That's a good question, Ms. Elwood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5058)|
| 1:24:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5059)|
| 1:24:22| We've been told they will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5062)|
| 1:24:23| We've been told that a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5063)|
| 1:24:29| There have been times in the past, as everyone knows, that when they haven't been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5069)|
| 1:24:33| there have been revisions to different kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5073)|
| 1:24:35| So I would assume that the department would make some kind of revision at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5075)|
| 1:24:41| But it does all right on that, the current law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5084)|
| 1:24:46| For the parent appeal process, how early can parents appeal that retention?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5086)|
| 1:24:52| Does it have to happen after the summer bridge camp,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5092)|
| 1:24:54| or can it happen as soon as those TCAP scores may or may not come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5094)|
| 1:24:59| I'm going to have Dr. Norton, thank you, to spot check me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| But my understanding is that once those TCAP scores come back, I think that's when the appeal happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5102)|
| 1:25:08| And what I was told in a meeting with the State Department is their goal is to have a five-day turnaround on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5108)|
| 1:25:14| because it was a concern of other superintendents as we met to have conversations with the department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| that very concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5119)|
| 1:25:21| Would we get the scores in time to be able to have the appeals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5121)|
| 1:25:24| and would the state be able to hear the appeals and turn them back around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5124)|
| 1:25:28| before families had to enroll their students in the summer bridge program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| And we were told that they think they could and could turn those around within five days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5131)|
| 1:25:34| So, Dr. Norton, I don't know if you have anything to add to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5134)|
| 1:25:36| but that was my understanding from the meeting I was at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5136)|
| 1:25:39| Do I remember right that we've only had those scores back on time once since 2015?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5139)|
| 1:25:46| Is that approximately right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5146)|
| 1:25:48| You may be right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5148)|
| 1:25:49| I know there are times when we have not had them back more than once.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5149)|
| 1:25:53| So just like we have to go back and change their grades after those come in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5153)|
| 1:25:58| could we have to change their retention status after those come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5158)|
| 1:26:04| I think you asked good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5164)|
| 1:26:06| I was in a group of superintendents who asked the same questions of the department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| and, again, we were told that they felt like it could be a five-day turnaround| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5170)|
| 1:26:14| and we would have time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5174)|
| 1:26:17| At this point, that's what we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5177)|
| 1:26:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5179)|
| 1:26:23| Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5183)|
| 1:26:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5186)|
| 1:26:27| Just a brief comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5187)|
| 1:26:30| I wanted Mr. Butler to thank him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5190)|
| 1:26:36| I want to thank him for his comment, and I appreciate that perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5196)|
| 1:26:44| I see what you're saying, and I agree totally with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5204)|
| 1:26:51| Thank you for pointing that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| Ms. Bight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| I agree with so many on the board, Mr. McMillan, that children need to be able to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5219)|
| 1:27:05| I think that this bill is something that is going to help us push Tennessee in that direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| of having kids that can read at a very proficient level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| and also identify students that do have issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| But I worry that if we wait too long, that's going to push us another year out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5237)|
| 1:27:23| I would really hate to have kids suffer and struggle more because of adults' decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5243)|
| 1:27:37| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5257)|
| 1:27:39| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5259)|
| 1:27:40| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5260)|
| 1:27:41| Ms. Bight, I would just say that the legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5261)|
| 1:27:45| we always do our legislative priorities in December because they don't start until January,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5265)|
| 1:27:50| so I don't think the timing of pushing it a month is really going to negatively impact that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5270)|
| 1:27:56| And I would just appreciate having Dr. Norton be able to weigh in on specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5276)|
| 1:28:01| So I don't think that that would negatively impact that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5281)|
| 1:28:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5299)|
| 1:28:21| So do we have any more discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5301)|
| 1:28:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5307)|
| 1:28:28| So moving on to item C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5308)|
| 1:28:31| Ms. Bight, I believe this is you as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5311)|
| 1:28:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| As with so many things, if you wait until it's perfect, it may never happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5316)|
| 1:28:43| So this is something that I've only been working on for a short period of time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5323)|
| 1:28:46| but certainly came up in our retreat, our two-day retreat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| And, you know, I know Knox County Schools has had a lot of kind of moving around of sorts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5330)|
| 1:28:57| and moving around of some committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5337)|
| 1:29:00| And so this has kind of come from several different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5340)|
| 1:29:03| I've met with lots of people and discussed this, Mr. Reiswick, Mr. Dupler, Mr. Myers, several other people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5343)|
| 1:29:11| And my meeting with Mr. Myers was really great, and he had so much better words than I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5351)|
| 1:29:19| And I would wonder if he wouldn't mind to speak on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5359)|
| 1:29:27| Thank you, Ms. Bight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| So I'll just briefly sort of overview.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5369)|
| 1:29:31| It was a long conversation, so I don't know that I'll perfectly capture it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| But I think that, as I understand it, the purpose is that you wanted to explore a committee around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5375)|
| 1:29:44| a board committee specifically around really the division of student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5384)|
| 1:29:50| And as I recall, where we landed was your hope was to create an area of input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5390)|
| 1:29:59| that could help our division better communicate, I guess, the services and programs that are available to students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5399)|
| 1:30:11| through the Knox County Schools and specifically the division of student success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5411)|
| 1:30:16| And that is a very short interview, but that is essentially what I took from it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5416)|
| 1:30:21| was a board committee that could help us, the division of student success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5421)|
| 1:30:28| better make known what all of our various programs and departments do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5428)|
| 1:30:34| and how those departments function to support the schools and the children of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5434)|
| 1:30:43| Yes, essentially that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5443)|
| 1:30:45| The parts that I don't have perfected, that I've talked with Gary and Terry about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5445)|
| 1:30:52| are that with a board committee, it would be public noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5452)|
| 1:30:57| The things that we talk about are public record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| so we would not necessarily be able to talk about specific children and certain things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5459)|
| 1:31:05| that would really be limited, and so I worry about that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5465)|
| 1:31:10| But if this were to be a committee that were functioning outside of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5470)|
| 1:31:15| I still would love to have the support of the board with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| And some notes that I had taken is, you know, how we communicate with parents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5479)|
| 1:31:25| because there are so often times that I think, especially to speak to parents that have special needs children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5485)|
| 1:31:36| you can be so overwhelmed with things, and when you're getting paper and getting materials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5496)|
| 1:31:44| it's so hard to suss out that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| So that's just one example of something that this would look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5506)|
| 1:31:50| But really making sure that students are successful in this new model that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5510)|
| 1:31:57| so that we can properly serve them and also minimize some liability on the district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5517)|
| 1:32:05| But I really want this to be something that could be collaborative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| and I'm open to that, and that's why I went ahead and put that forward this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| because I really would like to have this conversation with the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5533)|
| 1:32:27| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5547)|
| 1:32:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5549)|
| 1:32:31| Ms. Spike, I'm pretty visual, and I'm trying to put all the pieces together in my head and kind of map it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5551)|
| 1:32:38| It would be great for me if maybe on Wednesday you had a rough outline slash sketch of kind of what you're thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5558)|
| 1:32:45| kind of the bullet points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5565)|
| 1:32:46| I want to repeat back what I think I'm hearing to make sure that I'm capturing some of it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5566)|
| 1:32:51| So this would be a board-level committee that would make recommendations to Mr. Meyer's department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5571)|
| 1:32:58| about how to better communicate and engage families around the opportunities for their students who may have disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5578)|
| 1:33:09| It's not specific to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5589)|
| 1:33:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5590)|
| 1:33:11| No, that was just one good example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| I think there are so many other areas for student success,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5594)|
| 1:33:18| and so it is a little broad and I can absolutely put together those bullet points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5598)|
| 1:33:24| but I just think that there are a lot of different areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| Some are, you know, discipline and some of those encompassing issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5607)|
| 1:33:34| I know that during the workshop that we had, we talked about that the AEE was no longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5614)|
| 1:33:42| and that there were some board members that wanted some of those aspects, but that we also want to see action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5622)|
| 1:33:49| So this would be something that would prioritize an actionable thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5629)|
| 1:33:53| which would potentially be asking the board to do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5633)|
| 1:33:56| but I'm open to this not necessarily being a board committee or it being a board committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5636)|
| 1:34:01| But, like if I boil it all down, the function of this committee is to make specific recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5641)|
| 1:34:08| around student success to Mr. Meyer's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5648)|
| 1:34:12| It's a recommend, it's a, I'm trying to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5652)|
| 1:34:15| Yes, or to the board to have a motion or actionable item or to the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5655)|
| 1:34:22| Yeah, but basically trying to be, I want to make sure I understand the theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5662)|
| 1:34:26| So the theory is that the board, because we're elected by the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5666)|
| 1:34:31| we have certain insights into particular challenges or nuances that are happening in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5671)|
| 1:34:37| and that by having a regular discussion around what are families experiencing in the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5677)|
| 1:34:42| that might not be aiding their student success, that we then could relay that in the form of recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5682)|
| 1:34:48| and or other things to Mr. Meyer's department and or the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5688)|
| 1:34:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5699)|
| 1:35:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5700)|
| 1:35:01| Mr. Triplett, aren't there some guidelines we have to kind of hang that committee on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5701)|
| 1:35:07| Can you speak to those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| Mr. Dupler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5709)|
| 1:35:10| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5710)|
| 1:35:11| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5711)|
| 1:35:12| So, yes, I mean, what Ms. Byk and I talked about was that if it's a board member committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5712)|
| 1:35:21| there are some rules about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5721)|
| 1:35:23| Generally, it's three board members is the way that usually works because you have to have an odd number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5723)|
| 1:35:29| but you can't have a quorum, so you can't have five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5729)|
| 1:35:33| And then those committees are temporary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5733)|
| 1:35:36| So you'd be looking at probably, you know, a year would be kind of the time span.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5736)|
| 1:35:43| But it could be shorter, could be longer, but certainly not a standing committee because you can't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5743)|
| 1:35:49| And then the other thing she highlighted, which is if it's three board members, then everything is going to be public,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5749)|
| 1:35:57| all the meetings, everything public noticed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5757)|
| 1:36:00| And the problem with that is, I mean, you certainly could not get into specifics with regard to individual students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5760)|
| 1:36:06| because all that would be FERPA and IDEA and various levels of privacy concerns there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5766)|
| 1:36:13| So, I mean, that would be the issue with a board level committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5773)|
| 1:36:17| Now, if there's a different type of committee created from a different source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5777)|
| 1:36:24| and then maybe there's only one board member on it, then you wouldn't have all those hoops to jump through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5784)|
| 1:36:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5792)|
| 1:36:35| Thank you, Mr. DuPort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5795)|
| 1:36:38| So I guess just a question for structure of the committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5798)|
| 1:36:46| I mean, are we talking about a board committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| And aside from that, I don't know, Mr. Myers or Dr. Eislick, if you could speak to some of the other committees that you have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5810)|
| 1:37:00| or I know that we have Ms. Owenby that works with some of our students, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5820)|
| 1:37:06| But my first question, I guess, to you, Ms. Baik, is what would be that structure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5826)|
| 1:37:11| Because I agree with Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5831)|
| 1:37:13| We need to know exactly what we would be voting on, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5833)|
| 1:37:17| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5837)|
| 1:37:19| Well, I think to Mr. Dupler in saying that if it were a board committee, it would be short-term, limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5839)|
| 1:37:26| And I think that maybe that's where we would start, to have something that were short-term to dig into, see, are there things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5846)|
| 1:37:37| What are the things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5857)|
| 1:37:38| And, of course, you know, we couldn't go into details, but then to see, is this something that needs to carry on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5858)|
| 1:37:44| And then in that case, it would turn over to be not a board committee, but a separate outside committee with an appointed board member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5864)|
| 1:37:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| So, Mr. Dupler, how would that work as a separate outside committee with an appointed board member?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5880)|
| 1:38:06| Would that board member manage and run that committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5886)|
| 1:38:13| What would that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5893)|
| 1:38:15| Well, thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5895)|
| 1:38:18| You know, if there's a committee that's formed outside the board, and the most common way to do that would be the director of schools would put together some type of a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5898)|
| 1:38:28| And, you know, at that point, then, you know, one board member could be appointed to that committee by the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5908)|
| 1:38:38| So that's the way that would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5918)|
| 1:38:41| Now, if the board forms a board committee of three and it's temporary, I mean, there would still have to be something happen, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5921)|
| 1:38:56| In other words, the committee just can't transform to a different type of committee at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5936)|
| 1:39:04| So if the board were to form a board committee, you all can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5944)|
| 1:39:09| But then there would have to be another decision at some point in time to transform that committee, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5949)|
| 1:39:16| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| So, Dr. Reiswick or Mr. Myers, could one of you speak to the – I know we have some new committees that you formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5958)|
| 1:39:28| And then, Mr. Myers, what we have currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5968)|
| 1:39:32| Sure. So, you know, for our special pops, obviously Sue Ownby does an outstanding job with the special ed family advisory committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5972)|
| 1:39:40| And I believe that she and Ms. Byk have connected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5980)|
| 1:39:43| And obviously we would welcome any board member to be involved in that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5983)|
| 1:39:48| You know, more importantly, I think that Dr. Reiswick was really particular in trying to ensure that there were multiple levels of inputs for families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5988)|
| 1:39:56| And I think that, again, it goes back to what is the purpose of it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| If the purpose of it is to gain some sort of clarity around your student's plan or your rights as a parent or, you know, how you get your student evaluated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6001)|
| 1:40:10| the best place to get that information will always be at the school level, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| So if my student has an IEP, the best person for me to contact to get clarity around the student's program is going to be the case manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6015)|
| 1:40:23| And then, you know, there are subsequent structures above the case manager that can also be used as supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6023)|
| 1:40:29| But to get the best answer to a specific concern or point of confusion for a student, the best point of input is always going to be the school level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6029)|
| 1:40:40| And then we also have the regional family committees and the regional teacher committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6040)|
| 1:40:46| So I think that we have, again, multiple places where folks can get input to the district if they decide that they want to get involved in that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6046)|
| 1:40:59| And that's, again, based on the discussion as it has gone, it would seem, you know, trying again to get that information to parents who, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6059)|
| 1:41:09| have concerns or questions about their child's programming, whether it be special ed, RTI, ELL, whatever the case may be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6069)|
| 1:41:16| the best point of input will always be the school level and then the structures above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6076)|
| 1:41:28| Did you want to add anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6088)|
| 1:41:31| I just want to thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6091)|
| 1:41:32| No, I would echo what Mr. Meyer said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| I mean, I'm excited that the teacher councils are beginning this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6094)|
| 1:41:39| And so they're being in, you know, great conversations with Paul Hancock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6099)|
| 1:41:44| We've had some good things with PECA in the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6104)|
| 1:41:46| But we were talking through that the other day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6106)|
| 1:41:48| And just, you know, we're expanding those voices, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| I mean, we now have 91 family members in those councils.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6111)|
| 1:41:55| We'll have 91 teacher voices in those councils now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6115)|
| 1:41:59| And so I'm looking forward to the outcomes we get with that and how we can really get good ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6119)|
| 1:42:05| You know, I was able to, because I can't be at all of them, obviously, because they're meeting on the same day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6125)|
| 1:42:10| so I was able to kind of do a video introduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| And part of that is, you know, there are no silver bullets to this work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| Well, we are now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6136)|
| 1:42:17| Like, this stuff is extremely difficult, extremely challenging, multiple layers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6137)|
| 1:42:21| And it is something we want to do with families, with communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6141)|
| 1:42:25| It's something we want to do with teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6145)|
| 1:42:27| And we need those voices at the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6147)|
| 1:42:28| So just echoing what Mr. Meyer said, I mean, we have built those in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6148)|
| 1:42:32| We're going to work as well to anyone who wants to be involved in their school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6152)|
| 1:42:35| really getting a good list of what those organizations are at every school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6155)|
| 1:42:38| We think that's a great place, as Mr. Meyer said, to have people involved there and then also at the regional level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| And then, you know, I'll have the same later this month where my accelerated student learning committee starts to meet, so our council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6163)|
| 1:42:50| So I do think that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6170)|
| 1:42:51| And just I'm glad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6171)|
| 1:42:52| Again, it's a lot of work for a lot of people, a lot of calls to the community to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6172)|
| 1:42:56| And I think people have responded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6176)|
| 1:42:57| So we're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6177)|
| 1:43:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6180)|
| 1:43:01| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6183)|
| 1:43:04| I wasn't intending to ask this, Dr. Rice, but how many kids are on the student accelerated council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6184)|
| 1:43:09| Is it only students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6189)|
| 1:43:10| I'm just, it's a technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6190)|
| 1:43:13| Thank you for the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6193)|
| 1:43:14| So the council is not a student council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6194)|
| 1:43:16| It's actually a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6196)|
| 1:43:17| So we have, there's family members of the families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6197)|
| 1:43:20| There's business leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6200)|
| 1:43:22| There are educators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6202)|
| 1:43:23| They're all on that council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| But there are not students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6204)|
| 1:43:25| So no students on that council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6205)|
| 1:43:26| I'm just curious the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6206)|
| 1:43:27| You said 91 for the other two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| Yeah, that one's about, I have to, I see the spreadsheet in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6209)|
| 1:43:34| So I have to make sure it's either 34 or 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6216)|
| 1:43:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| Mr. Dupler, just a technical question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| I don't think I've been on the board when a new board level committee has been established.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| What are the minimum things that have to be in place for the establishment of a board level committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6223)|
| 1:43:49| For instance, does it need a charter, a defined charter, and or scope of work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6229)|
| 1:43:53| Or like what's the, what are like the things that have to be done in order for it to even be established beyond the boat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6233)|
| 1:44:00| Like what are the minimum things you have to have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6243)|
| 1:44:05| Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6245)|
| 1:44:06| So the board policy doesn't really define that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6246)|
| 1:44:10| Just that the committee be formed to the best extent possible by the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6250)|
| 1:44:16| I mean, a good example would be the superintendent search committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6256)|
| 1:44:19| I mean, you know, that was a committee of three that operated under the conditions that we've talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6259)|
| 1:44:25| And, you know, but of course the board wasn't super detailed when it was first, you know, set out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6265)|
| 1:44:36| I mean, gave it some general purpose and some guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6276)|
| 1:44:40| And then I know some things were tweaked along the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6280)|
| 1:44:44| But, I mean, that's probably the best example one recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6284)|
| 1:44:47| So there wasn't a, in that committee, there wasn't a rigid, written, well-defined scope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6287)|
| 1:44:52| It was in general through a conversation of the board, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6292)|
| 1:44:55| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6295)|
| 1:44:56| It was more guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6296)|
| 1:44:57| And as I'm sure you recall, the board would give.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| I do now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6299)|
| 1:45:00| Thanks for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6300)|
| 1:45:01| Yeah, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6301)|
| 1:45:02| You know, would give the different purposes, you know, in different times, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6302)|
| 1:45:06| And say different goals, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6306)|
| 1:45:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6308)|
| 1:45:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6309)|
| 1:45:13| Mr. Triplett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6313)|
| 1:45:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6314)|
| 1:45:15| Ms. Mike, I can appreciate the heart behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6315)|
| 1:45:17| My question is I'm just trying to figure out how it benefits us beyond, you know, the work that we're already doing in the schools currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6317)|
| 1:45:24| and some of the advisory councils we have and kind of what the benefit is beyond that would do more than what's already being done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6324)|
| 1:45:31| Yeah, that's a really great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| And like the conversation that I had with Mr. Myers, there is a lot of great work that's going on in all of these places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6334)|
| 1:45:41| And this is something just to speak, you know, if I'm representing my district and the parents in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6341)|
| 1:45:47| and the things that I've heard from them is that there is this struggle with them knowing what they have access to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6347)|
| 1:45:56| And, you know, I know that, you know, the pamphlet of rights is out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6356)|
| 1:46:00| But if you go to our website, kind of looking, it's really meaty and it's kind of there's not kind of like a boom, boom, boom of like here it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6360)|
| 1:46:10| And kind of refining that and so looking at that and talking to parents of like how does this work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6370)|
| 1:46:16| Because parents don't always have the option to come to meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6376)|
| 1:46:21| We have so many parents in our district that parents and guardians in our district that have three jobs or where they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6381)|
| 1:46:29| It's just it doesn't work for them to come to these things and having their voice kind of heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6389)|
| 1:46:34| This is something that would kind of facilitate that to look at like, okay, this is what school levels are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6394)|
| 1:46:40| And are we being successful in this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| Because I think some of the programs we have in place are really amazing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6403)|
| 1:46:46| I think a lot of parents don't know about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6406)|
| 1:46:49| And not for, you know, they just don't know who to ask or where to ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6409)|
| 1:46:54| And so kind of a little bit of that in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6414)|
| 1:47:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6424)|
| 1:47:05| So is there any more discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6425)|
| 1:47:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6433)|
| 1:47:15| So moving on to item 9D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6435)|
| 1:47:21| And this is the approval of the school zone for the new Northwest Sector Elementary School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6441)|
| 1:47:29| Is there any discussion on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6449)|
| 1:47:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6460)|
| 1:47:41| So seeing none, we are at public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6461)|
| 1:47:44| Ms. Henderson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6464)|
| 1:47:59| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6479)|
| 1:48:00| We have a lobbyist discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6480)|
| 1:48:02| I was looking at the regular meeting agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6482)|
| 1:48:04| Mr. Duport, do you have an update for us on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6484)|
| 1:48:08| You were going to check with procurement and there were some questions about the lobbyist the county used at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6488)|
| 1:48:17| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6497)|
| 1:48:18| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6498)|
| 1:48:20| Thank you for the privilege to talk about the lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6500)|
| 1:48:25| So I guess the good news for the board is that the board has options as far as the lobbyist is concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6505)|
| 1:48:33| I mean the way that procurement and the county have defined a lobbyist is that it is a professional service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6513)|
| 1:48:41| So that means that the board can seek out and contract with a service that it chooses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6521)|
| 1:48:51| So that's one option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6531)|
| 1:48:54| Another option is that the board can do a more formal search as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6534)|
| 1:49:00| Could ask for three or more quotes and qualifications for a lobbyist service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6540)|
| 1:49:10| And then obviously the board still has the option, although it's not required, to do a more formal RFP through procurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6550)|
| 1:49:19| So all those are viable options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6559)|
| 1:49:21| Now when it comes to using the lobbyist that the commission and the mayor use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6561)|
| 1:49:28| there would need to be some discussions with that particular lobbyist firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6568)|
| 1:49:35| That contract, I've reviewed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6575)|
| 1:49:39| I mean it's really specific to the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6579)|
| 1:49:42| I mean it doesn't have language in it that would necessarily include the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6582)|
| 1:49:49| So that's something that would need to be explored with that firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6589)|
| 1:49:53| But of course, I mean that would be a potential option just like any other of the options that I've discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6593)|
| 1:49:59| Right, and just for clarity for board members, I did ask Gary to look at that contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6599)|
| 1:50:05| In the event that we did have to go through the procurement process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| this may be a temporary solution to not having a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6609)|
| 1:50:13| because a lot of people had expressed concerns about not having anyone in Nashville this session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6613)|
| 1:50:18| So I did ask him to look at that contract and to see if, as a temporary solution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6618)|
| 1:50:23| that might be something we could do, use the same lobbyist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6623)|
| 1:50:28| Of course, that would be a discussion that the board would need to have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6628)|
| 1:50:32| but it was more in lines of options so that we could discuss how we wanted to move forward with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6632)|
| 1:50:41| Exactly right, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6641)|
| 1:50:43| And again, I mean that's not a contract that the board could just jump into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6643)|
| 1:50:47| because it's for a specific amount, for a specific purpose with the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6647)|
| 1:50:53| But again, if the board wanted to reach out to that group, which I believe is Stones River,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6653)|
| 1:50:59| and try and ask for a similar type of contract, that would be a possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6659)|
| 1:51:05| Right, and there's no guarantee that they would even want to enter into it, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6665)|
| 1:51:08| No, it was just more of exploring why options were out there for us at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6668)|
| 1:51:13| And that's how that came into play, just so everyone knows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6673)|
| 1:51:18| I was just curious if that could be a possible short-term solution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6678)|
| 1:51:23| So thank you for checking into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6683)|
| 1:51:25| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6685)|
| 1:51:26| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6686)|
| 1:51:27| I have some good news, which is not my way, so bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6687)|
| 1:51:34| I was on a call this morning with, it was a webinar with TSBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6694)|
| 1:51:39| and to give a little background, the Tennessee Legislative Network| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6699)|
| 1:51:43| that has always been what we call our legislative representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6703)|
| 1:51:47| around 2016 they stopped meeting regularly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6707)|
| 1:51:51| and there's always been some confusion about why and what's going on and that sort of thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6711)|
| 1:51:55| and they just started sending us the legislative reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| Now there is some clarity, and the Tennessee Legislative Network was sort of part of NSBA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6720)|
| 1:52:07| which we are no longer a member of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6727)|
| 1:52:09| So the TLN representative, that title no longer exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6729)|
| 1:52:14| so it will just be called a legislative representative from this point forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| And TSBA seems to be taking a much more hands-on approach to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6738)|
| 1:52:23| so they are planning to meet regularly and give us more regular updates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6743)|
| 1:52:28| Basically it sounds like they will be giving us the kind of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6748)|
| 1:52:33| that we've previously been getting through class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6753)|
| 1:52:36| So the amount of information that we will get directly I think will be greatly improved from TSBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6756)|
| 1:52:46| They are also looking at having meetings with all of the reps in the state regularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6766)|
| 1:52:54| so that we can also see what other reps are talking about in their districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6774)|
| 1:52:57| and that will be a little more clear to us from a statewide perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6777)|
| 1:53:01| So I think I feel much better about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6781)|
| 1:53:05| I feel much more supported there, so I think that will help a lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6785)|
| 1:53:08| and I think that will also give them the support of being able to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6788)|
| 1:53:13| this is what is being said statewide or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6793)|
| 1:53:18| I would note that the firm the county uses does have some conflicts of interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6798)|
| 1:53:26| I believe, with public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6806)|
| 1:53:28| So we really need to look into that and be sure we understand those conflicts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6808)|
| 1:53:35| and I assume that would be for a later discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6815)|
| 1:53:39| Since we do have support from TSBA now that is greatly increased over what we've had in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6819)|
| 1:53:46| I would feel comfortable looking into an RFP process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6826)|
| 1:53:50| so that we could talk about what we want in a lobbyist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6830)|
| 1:53:53| so we don't end up in a situation like we have been with us having expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6833)|
| 1:53:58| and not communicating those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6838)|
| 1:54:01| So looking at the RFP process as I've seen it before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6841)|
| 1:54:06| we would lay that all out on the front end, here are our expectations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6846)|
| 1:54:12| Or in a request for qualifications, they would lay that all out on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6852)|
| 1:54:18| and then we could look at all of those and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| does this look like what we want to determine which of those we like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6860)|
| 1:54:24| So I think that might be a possibility to give us some time to really consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| what we want from that lobbyist as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6868)|
| 1:54:32| And just to be clear, I don't even know that the county's lobbyists would want to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6872)|
| 1:54:36| I mean, that was just, they have 40 clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6876)|
| 1:54:40| That's just an option I asked him to look at just because I had heard those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6880)|
| 1:54:45| So what I'm hearing from you is it sounds like we will be getting good information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6885)|
| 1:54:50| and you feel confident with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6890)|
| 1:54:53| They've always given us a lot of information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6893)|
| 1:54:59| but it's not been boiled down into something that was very usable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6899)|
| 1:55:03| So I think it will be now, and I think they will be listening much more to what we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6903)|
| 1:55:09| And as we go through the RFP or whatever the board decides to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6909)|
| 1:55:13| I guess the biggest note of importance is we are our own representation in Nashville right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6913)|
| 1:55:20| So it will be on us to make sure that we are reaching out to our representatives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6920)|
| 1:55:35| about the issues that we're concerned about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6935)|
| 1:55:39| or that these mandates that do not come with funding, things like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6939)|
| 1:55:46| I would think it would be especially important to us, being one of the larger districts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6946)|
| 1:55:50| to make sure that they are aware of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6950)|
| 1:55:53| They've also laid out some duties for the representative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6953)|
| 1:55:57| And, of course, those are just what TSBA says our duties are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6957)|
| 1:56:01| So those will be available at policy review for us to consider also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6966)|
| 1:56:07| Well, thank you for the happy news, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6967)|
| 1:56:09| That doesn't happen a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6969)|
| 1:56:11| Okay, so aren't we waiting for everybody to turn around?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6971)|
| 1:56:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6974)|
| 1:56:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6976)|
| 1:56:17| So Ms. Henderson, moving to public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6977)|
| 1:56:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6980)|
| 1:56:21| We have one person signed up for public forum, Ms. Patty Saha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6981)|
| 1:56:27| State your name and county of residence, and you have three minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6987)|
| 1:56:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6991)|
| 1:56:32| I'm Patty Saha, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6992)|
| 1:56:34| I'm a resident of Hayden Hill, and I appreciate your careful review of the rezoning proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6994)|
| 1:56:39| I have three points for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=6999)|
| 1:56:42| First, there are two entrances to Hayden Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7002)|
| 1:56:45| and the newest phase is only two miles from Hardin Valley Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7005)|
| 1:56:49| making it the closest commute to the school of all the neighborhoods affected by the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7009)|
| 1:56:54| Furthermore, it is less than a quarter mile from other homes on the south side of Sam Lee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7014)|
| 1:56:59| that are not being rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7019)|
| 1:57:01| So a bus heading to Hardin Valley Elementary will continue to drive Sam Lee Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7021)|
| 1:57:06| It makes sense to pick up all the students on the south side of Sam Lee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7026)|
| 1:57:10| since the bus is already traveling the route,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| rather than creating a zoning split in the middle of Sam Lee Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7032)|
| 1:57:16| There is no alternative path than to drive past Hayden Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7036)|
| 1:57:20| and this makes the most of a route already established to Hardin Valley Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7040)|
| 1:57:25| Future developments have not yet begun on the north side of Sam Lee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7045)|
| 1:57:29| so rezoning the north side to the new school can be established for future buyers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7049)|
| 1:57:34| while the south side remains at Hardin Valley Elementary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7054)|
| 1:57:38| Second, please consider grandfathering families with students who have children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7058)|
| 1:57:43| at all three Hardin Valley schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7063)|
| 1:57:46| By requiring an older sibling at both the middle and the high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7066)|
| 1:57:50| for a family to continue at Hardin Valley Elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7070)|
| 1:57:53| we reduce the number of students eligible to stay at their current school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7073)|
| 1:57:57| while still helping those families who have the most drop-off challenges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7077)|
| 1:58:01| Third, please offer the choice to stay at Hardin Valley Elementary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7081)|
| 1:58:06| to current cross-country runners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7086)|
| 1:58:08| It is the only elementary sport, aside from track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7088)|
| 1:58:11| that requires students to attend the school for which they compete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7091)|
| 1:58:15| Furthermore, cross-country is a fall sport and requires a volunteer to run the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7095)|
| 1:58:21| Coach Jeff volunteers to head up both the elementary and the middle school programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7101)|
| 1:58:26| so the kids benefit from working with the same coach over a stretch of 3rd to 8th grade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7106)|
| 1:58:32| We practice throughout the summer, and the team always places in the top three at state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7112)|
| 1:58:36| having won seven championships in 11 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7116)|
| 1:58:39| The program is one of a kind due to the leadership of Coach Jeff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7119)|
| 1:58:43| who has both the experience and dedication to be a volunteer coach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7123)|
| 1:58:47| who heads up two fall sport programs and offers summer training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7127)|
| 1:58:52| We also run with Coach Jeff for post-season cross-country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7132)|
| 1:58:55| which includes AAU national races.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7135)|
| 1:58:58| My son has competed and medaled at these competitions for the past two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7138)|
| 1:59:03| due to the quality of this running program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7143)|
| 1:59:06| The new school will not have a cross-country team ready for the fall season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7146)|
| 1:59:10| Please consider these three points in your review of the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7150)|
| 1:59:15| I appreciate your time and trust you understand the need for some exceptions to this proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7155)|

| 1:59:51| That's fantastic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7191)|
| 1:59:52| And also all the school personnel, the bookkeepers, all those folks that just spent a ton of time doing coupon books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7192)|
| 2:00:00| It's a massive amount of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-ws-4178-221107?start=7200)|
