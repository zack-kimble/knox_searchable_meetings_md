| 0:20:01| I found a lot of resistance there and here, even once my daughter came back to go to school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1201)|
| 0:20:09| here, and I think a lot of it is because of the lack of information, and it's not being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1209)|
| 0:20:14| shared, and so I felt myself having to train the people that were already paid to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1214)|
| 0:20:20| these things, and it let me see that there's a great need for someone to be an advocate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1220)|
| 0:20:26| for the people, that the people that are currently going through things that a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| of you all will never experience unless you've lived there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| And so in the process of that, I've lived in my car after being evicted wrongfully for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1235)|

| 0:20:46| I was retaliated against.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1246)|
| 0:20:47| I have cases in the state court, federal court, so forth and so on, and so I'm here now to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| care for my father, but my daughter, my youngest daughter, is a student at South Door High| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1253)|
| 0:20:58| School, and that brings me to being a parent as well as a former student of Austin East| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1264)|
| 0:21:05| My oldest daughter graduated with honors from Austin East High School, and even though I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| was a 15-year-old high school dropout, without having parents there for me to teach me the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1269)|
| 0:21:15| things that I needed to know as well as suffering from a mental illness that I wasn't aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1275)|
| 0:21:21| of, the road was rough, but I made it through in spite of all of those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| And in the process, I've witnessed the issues that are preventing people like myself and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| others from being the best person they can be in spite of the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1292)|
| 0:21:37| And so what's going on right now with the school, whoever recommended the task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1297)|
| 0:21:44| and I know they, you know, took that off, but I really feel that considering the history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1304)|
| 0:21:50| of the Eastern Austin community, this violence and this gun stuff is nothing new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1310)|
| 0:21:56| I even experienced dealing with these children that are experiencing a lot of issues at home| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1316)|
| 0:22:02| first, before they even get to school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1322)|
| 0:22:05| And so when we just throw two hours of therapy at the children and not even address the parents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1325)|
| 0:22:10| at home that are often suffering from things like I was when I was raising my daughter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1330)|
| 0:22:15| 15, trying to be a mother, where children, trying to raise children, we're doing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| best we know how to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1339)|
| 0:22:20| And I feel that we have to address this issue as a community, and it's going to take our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| voices to be heard on a task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1346)|
| 0:22:29| I feel that we should be involved in the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| It should be a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1351)|
| 0:22:33| It should even include truancy, you know, if people don't attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1353)|
| 0:22:39| That's when truancy should be enforced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| I'm working with other community organizers that are already providing security for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| area in Eastern Knoxville, and they're doing things with the children and trying to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| the parents involved, but without financial support and a voice and a platform for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1369)|
| 0:22:55| to be heard fairly and actually be done something with, then nothing's going to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| This has been going on for so long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1380)|
| 0:23:02| And I was an in-school suspension teacher at Carter Middle School for three years while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1382)|
| 0:23:06| my oldest daughter was going to middle school there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1386)|
| 0:23:09| I was assigned to one of the worst bus routes in Knox County schools, and it was because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1389)|
| 0:23:15| there was so much violence coming from Eastern Knoxville to Strawberry Plains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1395)|
| 0:23:19| And, you know, the job that I had as an in-school suspension instructor gave me some insight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| We were trained in crisis prevention and intervention techniques, kind of wondering why the police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1404)|
| 0:23:30| are not automatically trained with as much as we were trained with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| Now, if they're in there addressing these issues, then I feel that if the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1414)|
| 0:23:39| and the family were trained and re-taught, a lot of us don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1419)|
| 0:23:43| It's things that I'm still learning today, that, you know, it's because nobody was there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| And the reason nobody was there is because the things that have gone on have prevented that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1432)|
| 0:23:53| I do have to stop you now, but I appreciate you coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1435)|
| 0:23:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1436)|
| 0:23:57| So I would want to come back, and I wanted to encourage y'all to reconsider because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1437)|
| 0:24:01| got to do something different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1441)|

| 0:24:33| What makes a school safe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1473)|
| 0:24:35| This article from an October retired teacher's magazine says police-free schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1475)|
| 0:24:42| I'm a retired elementary teacher and principal, retired for 20 years after educating for 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1482)|
| 0:24:50| I'm married to Don Loy, also retired from teaching chemistry and physics at Farragut High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1490)|
| 0:24:56| We're still interested in public education, Don being the immediate past president of the Retired Teachers Association in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1496)|
| 0:25:05| This article piqued my interest and concern in October when I read it, and I tore it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1505)|
| 0:25:12| And after the death of Anthony Thompson, Jr. at the hands of a police officer in Austin East School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| I made copies along with a personal note to mail to appropriate leaders in the school administration, local governments, and city and county uniformed officers leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1518)|
| 0:25:31| I now have made enough copies, nine copies for you, and I'll mail them to you later this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1531)|
| 0:25:37| Several teachers spoke on the subject for this article.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| A Patterson, New Jersey math teacher, Mr. Thompson, said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| You ask a kid what makes them feel secure at school, I doubt they'll say police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1546)|
| 0:25:52| What they'll talk about is their friendships, what they're learning in class, and how their teachers and staff respect them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1552)|
| 0:25:59| He went on to say they've been talking about this for a long time, but more people are realizing that people are not making our schools safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1559)|
| 0:26:07| Another teacher in special education in Minneapolis contributed a story about her daughter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1567)|
| 0:26:13| who got into a physical altercation with a boy who had been taunting and violating her repeatedly with vulgar comments and touches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1573)|
| 0:26:22| The administration knew, the teacher said, but they hadn't done anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| The SRO, or school resource officer, stepped in, grabbed the girl from behind, and slapped handcuffs on her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1587)|
| 0:26:34| The girl had had enough and couldn't take it any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1594)|
| 0:26:38| She needed school counselors and school psychologists to come in and calm her down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| The teacher asked, What are we doing to our students? Do they do what I say now, or I'm going to get physical with you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1603)|
| 0:26:53| Is that really what they need to hear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1613)|
| 0:26:56| How is that going to help them manage their emotions and learn the skills they need to help resolve conflicts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1616)|
| 0:27:04| I know that education is way underfunded, and the police officers and sheriff's deputies are probably well-funded in comparison,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1624)|
| 0:27:13| but we need the helping staff in our schools. We need training in mediation and de-escalation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1633)|
| 0:27:20| In this article, a student attending a middle school in Montgomery County, Maryland, noticed a difference in the school climate with school resources officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1640)|
| 0:27:31| compared with his elementary school, where he felt safer, where teachers could try to solve the problem if a fight broke out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1651)|
| 0:27:40| In my note, I told of teaching second grade for seven years at the former East Florida Elementary School, which served Walter P. Taylor Homes in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1660)|
| 0:27:51| A boy from deprived school grew angry one day, stood up, and threw his desk against the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1671)|
| 0:27:57| I got up, put my arms around him gently, and rocked with him, standing and saying quietly into his ear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1677)|
| 0:28:04| it'll be all right, it'll be all right, until he calmed down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| I didn't call the office for Mrs. Evan Williams, the principal. She never knew anything about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1690)|
| 0:28:15| This is the kind of help children need. I still have the photo, though, of that boy when he grew to a man in the newspaper being arrested for killing somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1695)|
| 0:28:28| I'm part of a community that's asking for a great change in the way we treat students in schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1708)|
| 0:28:35| and to help teachers and staff to understand these kids, and maybe to be kinder and more loving towards them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1715)|
| 0:28:42| plus do our best to provide supplementary mental and psychological help in each school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1722)|
| 0:28:48| Thank you for letting me speak today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1728)|

| 0:29:27| There's absolutely no way I can fully express the extent of my anger with Mayor Kincannon's decision to pull KPD officers out of schools on June 12th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1767)|
| 0:29:38| This is reckless. My son attends a school that will be affected by this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1778)|
| 0:29:44| Our school had a shooting years ago. My family wants police protection in our school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1784)|
| 0:29:50| My family's voice matters. Decisions like this should not be made hastily or without community input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1790)|
| 0:29:55| That is owed every citizen in the Knoxville community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1795)|
| 0:30:00| There's absolutely no reason for the city and KPD to withdraw from the MOA in order to discuss and negotiate a new agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1800)|
| 0:30:08| After speaking with our KPD officer and Dr. Brown, our principal, this morning, I would like to share some input from Dr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1808)|
| 0:30:17| Our officers attend 80 hours of training each year, 40 hours state conference, 40 hours national conference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1817)|
| 0:30:24| Security in the school is not enough. If we are going to protect students from potential outside threats, we need police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1824)|
| 0:30:32| They are aware of potential threats in the community and can alert schools much faster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| Dr. Brown fully supports officers being in our school buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| He said if we want police to change the way they respond and be more proactive rather than reactive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1841)|
| 0:30:47| we need them in schools to get them to know students and build relationships with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1847)|
| 0:30:52| He thinks it is important that officers are proactive rather than reactive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1852)|
| 0:30:57| By having officers in schools interacting with students on a daily basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1857)|
| 0:31:02| they have the opportunity to build trust and prevent situations rather than react as an officer responding off the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1862)|
| 0:31:09| My principal could go on and on about how important they are to our school and building a positive culture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1869)|
| 0:31:17| but he realizes that is not the case everywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1877)|
| 0:31:19| He said he is willing for anyone who would like to come and witness how Officer Edwards interacts with our students to stop by anytime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1879)|
| 0:31:29| Officer Edwards is intentional about being visible and getting to know our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1889)|
| 0:31:35| He thinks it is important that we change how officers are viewed and clearly define their roles in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1895)|
| 0:31:43| In closing, I would like to say that our children have already been used as political pawns for COVID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1903)|
| 0:31:50| Now let's not use them as political pawns when it comes to safety in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1910)|
| 0:31:55| That's not acceptable. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| Thank you. Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| We are going to be respectful for everyone that comes to speak here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| Charlie Dorsett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1926)|
| 0:32:16| If you'll please state your name and county of residence, then you get five minutes to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| I'm Charlie Dorsett from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1940)|
| 0:32:23| I would first like to thank the board for all the hard work and effort put into making our school safe this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1943)|
| 0:32:29| It's been amazing that we've been able to come in person all year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1949)|
| 0:32:32| It has quite been enjoyable for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| I am a 10th grade student at L&M STEM Academy right in the heart of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| Many people each week walk onto our campus, some not knowing that L&M is a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1961)|
| 0:32:47| some wanting just to look inside, and others wanting to interact with the students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| I once had a lady come up to me and my friends and ask to play volleyball with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1972)|
| 0:32:57| Another time, some people walked up to me and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| I want to play with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| Another time, some people walked right up to the school just to come charge their phones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| Sorry. This is just a normal day on our campus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1987)|
| 0:33:11| And at times, we rely on our SRO to keep unwanted people off of the school campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| and off the school grounds to keep us safe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| I am very thankful that they were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| However, having several officers not equipped to work with children is too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2001)|
| 0:33:26| School is a safe place to learn and even make a few friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2006)|
| 0:33:30| No student or teacher should have to come into school worried about if their incident at their school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2010)|
| 0:33:36| will be the next caused by a KPD officer not trained to work with children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2016)|
| 0:33:44| I am eternally grateful for the safety that the KPD officers enforce in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2024)|
| 0:33:50| and I am grateful that they are there to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2030)|
| 0:33:52| However, a line must be drawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2032)|
| 0:33:54| If officers in our school are not trained to work with children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2034)|
| 0:33:58| they should be where they are trained to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| If police officers work with children, they must be trained to work with children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2045)|
| 0:34:07| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| Carrie Hopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| If you will please state your name and county of residence and you will have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| My name is Carrie Hopper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2063)|
| 0:34:25| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2065)|
| 0:34:27| I come before you today as a former KCF staff member| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2067)|
| 0:34:31| and a current advocate for students living with intellectual and physical disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2071)|
| 0:34:35| I previously worked at Fulton High School in the CDCA department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2075)|
| 0:34:39| and am now employed as a behavioral therapist for children and teenagers with intellectual disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2079)|
| 0:34:45| Many of the students and clients I have worked with over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| do not see and process the world in the same way that you and I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| Many of the students and clients I have worked with do not have a strong sense of danger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2092)|
| 0:34:57| nor do some of them have the ability to speak up for themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2097)|
| 0:35:00| if they experience abuse or wrongdoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2100)|
| 0:35:03| Having police in schools poses a huge threat to our disabled students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2103)|
| 0:35:07| First off, police are not trained on how to restrain or physically handle students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2107)|
| 0:35:12| with physical disabilities such as cerebral palsy or other diagnoses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| that might cause low muscle tone or like a spastic syndrome similar to cerebral palsy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2115)|
| 0:35:22| So that poses a huge threat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2122)|
| 0:35:25| Also, students in special education, KCS, all have IEPs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| and many of them also have behavior plans specifically designed to deal with maladaptive behaviors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| that may arise due to a variety of factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| But I learned at our last meeting here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2138)|
| 0:35:41| that when KCSO and KPD officers begin interacting and arresting students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| if behaviors arise, that their department automatically like takes over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2147)|
| 0:35:52| and takes the jurisdiction and KCS no longer has control over the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| So if a student on a behavior plan with an IEP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| is having maladaptive behaviors due to their disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| and sometimes those might look violent to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2166)|
| 0:36:08| because we don't understand what's going on in the student's brain with their disability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| and the police take over and start arresting that student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2173)|
| 0:36:17| Last time I was here I heard a story from a mother that that happened to her child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2177)|
| 0:36:22| KCS can do nothing about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| When like special educators have written a whole behavior plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| a whole IEP on how to deal with these behaviors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2189)|
| 0:36:32| That's against the student's rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2192)|
| 0:36:35| A student with a disability cannot help having maladaptive behaviors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2195)|
| 0:36:39| and sometimes violent behaviors and that's why we have IEPs and behavior plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| If a student with an intellectual disability who maybe saw a gun on TV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2204)|
| 0:36:48| and thought it was a cool toy reached for an armed officer's gun,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2208)|
| 0:36:52| would the officer shoot them like they shot Anthony Thompson Jr.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| If a student with an intellectual disability brought a gun to school thinking it was a toy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2216)|
| 0:37:00| would the officer shoot them like they shot Anthony Thompson Jr.?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2220)|
| 0:37:04| Anthony Thompson Jr. had a gun at school and he was shot and killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2224)|
| 0:37:09| If a student with a disability brought a gun to school thinking it was a toy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2229)|
| 0:37:13| would a KPD officer do the same thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2233)|
| 0:37:16| I think they would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| Police in schools are not safe for anyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| but they are especially not safe for our students in marginalized communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2242)|
| 0:37:26| Students with disabilities, black and brown students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2246)|
| 0:37:28| LGBTQ students are all at risk for police violence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| both inside our school buildings and outside of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2252)|
| 0:37:35| Do not begin a new MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2255)|
| 0:37:37| Take the police out of our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| Invest in mental health workers for students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| and other preventative measures against student violence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| Each one of you that votes to keep police in schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| after the death of Anthony Thompson Jr. has blood on your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2268)|
| 0:37:52| Think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| Erin Bickneis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2278)|
| 0:38:07| Is Erin Bickneis here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2287)|
| 0:38:18| Please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2298)|
| 0:38:21| Erin Bickneis, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2301)|
| 0:38:24| Sorry, I'm just getting here from work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2308)|
| 0:38:42| My name is Erin Bickneis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2322)|
| 0:38:45| and I'd like to speak about the issue of school safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| My educational background is in conflict resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| and for most of my adult life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| I've worked with children of all ages from preschool to high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| in school settings, nontraditional educational settings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2335)|
| 0:38:58| and also as a volunteer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2338)|
| 0:39:01| such as through the Amachi Mentoring Program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2341)|
| 0:39:04| with a child for the last 11 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| whose parents are incarcerated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2346)|
| 0:39:09| When we're thinking about school safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2349)|
| 0:39:12| I'd really like to encourage us to think expansively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| and really increase what that means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| I think we can use our imaginations to go much further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| than just doing a tiny little better job in this direction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2361)|
| 0:39:23| or a tiny little better job in that direction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2363)|
| 0:39:26| or just increasing what we've been doing all along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2366)|
| 0:39:31| In a lot of the schools I've worked in and attended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2371)|
| 0:39:34| I went to lots of different schools as a kid and as a teenager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| Very few of them had police there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| The ones that didn't had a lot of things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| that made those parents and children and staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| feel perfectly safe to send their kids there every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2386)|
| 0:39:49| They had doors that locked well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2389)|
| 0:39:51| and they had staff that were able to be there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2391)|
| 0:39:54| to welcome people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| They also had the kind of teacher-student ratios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2397)|
| 0:40:00| that allowed every student and child to be seen and known| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2400)|
| 0:40:03| and to be noticed when something was going wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2403)|
| 0:40:06| They had funding for after-school programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| and activities that meant it was the norm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| for kids to have something to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2412)|
| 0:40:15| Some of those schools had 98% participation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| in after-school programs that meant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| they had all kids' needs, from sports to the arts to music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2421)|
| 0:40:24| Those kinds of things allow for not just something to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| and a safe place to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| but also opportunities for kids to connect with adults| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2430)|
| 0:40:33| who then are on their side and on their team as mentors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2433)|
| 0:40:36| as people to look up to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2436)|
| 0:40:39| When I'm thinking about schools and communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2439)|
| 0:40:42| we know what makes them safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2442)|
| 0:40:45| and the safest ones do not have the most police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2445)|
| 0:40:48| The ones that do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| are the safest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2451)|
| 0:40:54| And if they were, then adding more police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2454)|
| 0:40:57| or if we looked at the place that had the most police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| we would think, gosh darn, what safe places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| Don't we all want to live there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2463)|
| 0:41:06| But that's not how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2466)|
| 0:41:09| The communities that are the safest have the most resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2469)|
| 0:41:12| We are pouring the most into those children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2472)|
| 0:41:15| those families, those economies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2475)|
| 0:41:18| We're making them places that people want to enjoy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2478)|
| 0:41:21| that people want to connect with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2481)|
| 0:41:24| When I think about what happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2484)|
| 0:41:27| with Anthony Thompson Jr. and his death last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2487)|
| 0:41:30| I think about so many things that could have prevented it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2490)|
| 0:41:33| and police clearly weren't one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2493)|
| 0:41:36| Some of the things that would have prevented it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| would have been teachers with enough time and energy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| to pay attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| I know all the teachers care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| but if we had better funding for our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| they would be there all the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| they would be able to keep an eye out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2514)|
| 0:41:57| they would be able to develop those strong relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2517)|
| 0:42:00| and be there when things are going wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| We would have strong counseling programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| and conflict resolution programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2526)|
| 0:42:09| We would have education beginning in kindergarten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| with age-appropriate information about safe relationships,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2532)|
| 0:42:15| respecting others' boundaries and bodies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2535)|
| 0:42:18| and how to communicate when you have disagreements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2538)|
| 0:42:21| We would have more enforcement for parents to call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| when they need outside support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2544)|
| 0:42:27| The verb to police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2547)|
| 0:42:30| has nothing to do with protecting or improving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| or supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| It rather speaks directly to hovering over people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2556)|
| 0:42:39| ready to keep them in line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| This attitude and this approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| that comes with having police in schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2565)|
| 0:42:48| this is the attitude and approach that comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2568)|
| 0:42:51| with having police in schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| If we are seeing some communities and thus some schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| as being in need of policing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| that says a lot about what we think as the problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| and how we see the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| not as people just like us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| deserving extra care and support and love| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| to bring out our very best expressions of ourselves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| but as people who might go wrong at any turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| who need to be kept in line and punished when they do wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| There is inherent racism in this approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2601)|
| 0:43:24| In applying this model to students in general| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2604)|
| 0:43:27| and specifically to our East Knoxville and Austin East communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| there's also inherent danger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| in thinking that our most capable problem solvers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2613)|
| 0:43:36| are the ones who carry guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2616)|
| 0:43:39| In all these schools I attended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2619)|
| 0:43:42| where the police presence was zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2622)|
| 0:43:45| like I said, we felt safe, and it wasn't because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2625)|
| 0:43:48| we knew someone with a gun would show up at any second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| I need you to stop. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2631)|
| 0:43:54| Shannon Harper Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2634)|
| 0:44:03| And if you'll state your name and county of residence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2646)|

| 0:44:17| I'd like to echo much of what Ms. Lloyd said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2657)|
| 0:44:20| But first I want to say that time is fleeting and very precious| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| and these meetings should be held at more convenient times and places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2663)|
| 0:44:26| to make them easily accessible to all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2666)|
| 0:44:29| How can the voices of concerned citizens in East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2669)|
| 0:44:32| District 1 be heard and resonate as loud as those in Bearden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| Corns, and Farragut when the majority of our families| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| are headed by single parents who often work two or more jobs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2678)|
| 0:44:41| I am here to address the cops in our schools situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2681)|
| 0:44:44| Your resolution states that cops have been in schools since 1950,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| but it failed to mention that it began in Flint, Michigan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| as a so-called relationship builder between cops and the youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| and the fact that the cops were teachers and counselors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2692)|
| 0:44:55| I grew up in the 70s, 80s, and 90s as a teacher's kid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2695)|
| 0:44:58| I attended Sermole Green, Green School, Spring Hill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2698)|
| 0:45:01| Whittles, and Holston, and I don't recall seeing cops| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2701)|
| 0:45:04| in schools itself, maybe at sporting events, and when they were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| educating us on social dangers like drugs, child murders, and such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| We had teachers and administrators like Mr. Bowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| Ms. Lula Powell, Mr. Thacker, Ms. Yarbrough, Ms. Hicks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2712)|
| 0:45:16| Mr. Mitchell, the Fultons, and Coach Anderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| They knew how to handle their class, teach and reach each child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2719)|
| 0:45:22| and even the smarty pants, the class clowns, and especially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| the differently abled. They didn't need police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| Your resolution further states that after the school shootings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2728)|
| 0:45:31| in Sandy Hook and Columbine, trained and eventually armed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| officers were put inside our schools. Exactly what are they trained to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| They definitely have the armed part down, trained to shoot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2737)|
| 0:45:39| and apparently kill, even if their so-called training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2739)|
| 0:45:42| jeopardizes students and teachers in hallways and fellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| officers who might be involved. Let's be factual and honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| Police were created as slave patrols and continue to serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| as such with black and minority communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| The 1700s is the earliest known school gun violence incidents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2754)|
| 0:45:57| and tragedies mainly involved adults who were shunned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| or scorned by lovers, or kids, or siblings who were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2760)|
| 0:46:03| whipped in school. Present day, as of April 2021,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| 53% of the violent gun incidents are carried out by whites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2765)|
| 0:46:08| some of whom suffer from depression and who are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2768)|
| 0:46:11| treated with prescription drugs. The irresponsible gun laws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2771)|
| 0:46:14| of government and their role in the flood of drugs and guns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2774)|

| 0:46:23| of the reasons kids can easily obtain guns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| You say trauma-informed school. Where were those resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2786)|

| 0:46:50| My family has been celebrating it for about 15 years now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2810)|

| 0:46:56| that day being the only day blacks could go to Chihuahua Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2816)|

| 0:47:08| And now you want to honor Juneteenth all of a sudden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2828)|
| 0:47:11| because it got national attention. But honestly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| teach the truth and the many contributions of black history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| and stop whitewashing it. And maybe more of our youth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2837)|
| 0:47:20| will aspire to be more than a gang member or drug dealer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2840)|
| 0:47:23| or athlete or entertainer. Strategic efforts to hire more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2843)|
| 0:47:26| black teachers is laughable when the majority of the teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2846)|

| 0:48:02| Look at what happened to Anthony when they sneaked in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2882)|
| 0:48:05| school and he was traumatized by the most recent violent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| events happening to his schoolmates, or maybe that he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| was differently abled. Would that have mattered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| Probably not, because I know we all have a date with death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2894)|
| 0:48:17| and no one can delay it and nothing can happen without the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2897)|
| 0:48:20| permission of the most high. Fact, school-based mental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| health providers have been evidence to improve outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| for students and improve overall school safety.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2906)|
| 0:48:29| So, we propose that mentors from the community are in our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2909)|
| 0:48:32| school buildings building relationships with the students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2912)|
| 0:48:35| and that there should be a buffer between law enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2915)|
| 0:48:38| There are organizations that I am a founder of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2918)|
| 0:48:41| Monarch Tribe, Inc. for one, is seeking to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| better opportunities for our students like karate and fish| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| and other outlets for them to express themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2929)|
| 0:48:52| There's an organization called Pop Teen and Community Bridges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| and love is the answer. We are already enabled to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| trained in positive youth development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2938)|

| 0:49:22| I come to you guys today as I've worked with you guys for many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2962)|
| 0:49:25| years, for the past 20 years. I've rebuilt Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2965)|
| 0:49:27| schools, rebuilt KCDC, the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2967)|
| 0:49:30| Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| Safety Building, and the recent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| Knox County Sheriff's Office prison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2976)|
| 0:49:39| Been working inside and outside of the East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2979)|
| 0:49:42| and been in each and every one of your schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2982)|
| 0:49:45| over the past 15 years, as I said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2985)|
| 0:49:48| One of the things that I'm here as a parent is to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2988)|
| 0:49:51| with the way that the crime has been going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2991)|
| 0:49:54| especially with being part of the gang task force here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| Knoxville. I've been a part of the gang task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=2997)|
| 0:50:00| for a very short period of time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3000)|
| 0:50:03| over a small period of time, to even think of removing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3003)|
| 0:50:06| officers out of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3006)|
| 0:50:09| Are there very many options to fix the scenario and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| problems that everybody has? A hundred percent agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| More counselors, more money, more money, more money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3015)|
| 0:50:18| There isn't a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| So I ask that you guys not wait until the 24th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| 29th of September to come up with an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| That's what one of your board members said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3027)|
| 0:50:30| for the resolution that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3030)|
| 0:50:33| Your security officers, although I've met many of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| are wonderful men, but the training compared to a KPD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| officer is nowhere compared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| It's 120 hours of training for the officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3042)|
| 0:50:45| 80 for school security, and 40 for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3045)|
| 0:50:48| A security officer has one week of training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3048)|
| 0:50:51| including firearms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3051)|
| 0:50:54| So the principals who are to dictate what the security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3054)|
| 0:50:57| officer does, does two hours of online training for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3057)|
| 0:51:00| shooter. Online training for a shooter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3060)|
| 0:51:03| So my question for you is that the crime is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| the issues are there, the training for KPD is by far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| superior than what you have for your security officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| Wonderful people, but it needs to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3072)|
| 0:51:15| Pretty much it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3075)|
| 0:51:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3078)|
| 0:51:21| And there was one person I want to see if there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| Is Josie Maynard here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3083)|
| 0:51:26| Okay, that concludes public forum on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3086)|
| 0:51:29| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| Oh, Josie Maynard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| If you'll please state your name and county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3098)|
| 0:51:41| My name is Josie Maynard, and I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3101)|
| 0:51:44| I'm a senior at KGB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3104)|
| 0:51:47| I'm a senior at KGB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3107)|
| 0:51:50| I'm a senior at KGB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3110)|
| 0:51:53| I'm a senior at KGB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| Since I've been a Knox County student, students have never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3116)|
| 0:51:59| been involved in the decisions made about their schools and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3119)|
| 0:52:02| their education. When you all look at the faces in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| this room there are no students here begging you to keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3125)|
| 0:52:08| law enforcement in the schools. You see a group of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3128)|
| 0:52:11| adamant about wanting law enforcement out of schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| And you may think that your opinion is best as a staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| member or maybe a parent of a privileged student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3137)|
| 0:52:20| But it's time to stop thinking about yourselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3140)|
| 0:52:23| community. You all, myself as well, have privilege that other people don't always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3143)|
| 0:52:28| get. We have the privilege to not be scared of getting killed every time that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3148)|
| 0:52:32| we see an officer. We have the privilege to walk into a room and not turn heads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3152)|
| 0:52:36| We have the privilege to say what we want and do what we want without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3156)|
| 0:52:39| consequences from law enforcement, and we have the privilege to be afraid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3159)|
| 0:52:43| and not get killed for it. Anthony never got those privileges. Most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3163)|
| 0:52:48| Austinese students will never get that privilege. I have my own negative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3168)|
| 0:52:52| experiences with law enforcement just because I'm a woman. When I was 15, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3172)|
| 0:52:55| was told by a police officer that I would never be anything more than a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3175)|
| 0:52:58| prostitute, and I've now exceeded my education, and I'm a certified nursing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3178)|
| 0:53:02| assistant, and I have my associates degree by the age of 18, and I proved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| them wrong. But Anthony Thompson Jr. never got the opportunity to prove the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| officers wrong. He never got the opportunity to graduate, to turn 18, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3191)|
| 0:53:15| say goodbye to his family, and he never even got the opportunity to finish his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| last sentence. Law enforcement in schools affects all minorities, and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| you vote, or if you decide that you don't want to take law enforcement out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| of schools, then what is your solution? Until we see justice, you will get no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3207)|
| 0:53:31| peace, and we will continue to come to your meetings. We will continue to march| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3211)|
| 0:53:35| in the streets, and we will continue to speak up for the people who never get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3215)|
| 0:53:38| speak up for themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| Thank you. Okay, thank you. Excuse me. Thank you. Thank you to all our speakers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3221)|
| 0:53:50| for coming. We have a motion and a second on the floor. Mr. Watson. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3230)|
| 0:53:57| Madam Chair. I'm extremely grateful for all the many emails and phone calls and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3237)|
| 0:54:03| communications and speakers last week, and even tonight, speaking to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| resolution and to the issues around safety and security in our schools. If| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| anything, I think those communications give credence to the need for this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3253)|
| 0:54:17| resolution, because I think what we're hearing, not from just the folks in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| room tonight, but from many others that I've talked to over the last week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| especially, is that this is a conversation that's time to be had. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| a conversation that we need to involve the key stakeholders in, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3269)|
| 0:54:34| certainly our students and our parents and many others. I do think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3274)|
| 0:54:38| important for me to clear up some context around the resolution, given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3278)|
| 0:54:42| some of the actions that other people took last week after the resolution was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3282)|
| 0:54:46| made public. So I know some folks in the community and the media have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| confused regarding the resolution that myself and Ms. Satterfield brought to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| the board last week, in light of the letter of the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3294)|
| 0:54:58| received from the Knox County Education Coalition in the letter from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3298)|
| 0:55:01| Mayor Kincannon. It's important for people to note that the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3301)|
| 0:55:05| Education Coalition is a community group, like many other community groups, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| they have the right to write a letter to the board at any time. That doesn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| mean it's on the agenda or up for discussion, but many people got confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| in thinking that was the resolution. I can't tell you how many people I had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| email and say, did you read the actual resolution? And they hadn't, and I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3318)|
| 0:55:23| fault them for that, but it certainly was an opportunity for confusion about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| the intent of this resolution was. The resolution before the Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3327)|
| 0:55:32| tonight and in the previous version last week was released well before the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| from KCEC or Mayor Kincannon's announcement last week. I certainly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| could have never imagined that those two things would have happened prior to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| the resolution being released. I even worked with Carly and she helped me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3345)|
| 0:55:50| think through a press release as I released the resolution to try to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3350)|
| 0:55:53| ahead of any potential stories that would divert from the intent of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3353)|
| 0:55:59| resolution. So the current memorandum of agreement outlining the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3359)|
| 0:56:04| working relationships between KCS, KPD, and KCSO was completed in 2019. KCS's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3364)|
| 0:56:10| chief of security, Gus Peduces, took the lead on creating that MOA, at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3370)|
| 0:56:15| according to conversations I've had with him, and now he has formally announced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3375)|
| 0:56:19| his retirement earlier this year, effective at the end of June 2021. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3379)|
| 0:56:24| think it is time for the Board of Education, along with central| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| administration, to revisit the MOA, but also to do that with community. According| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| to Tennessee law, it is the duty of the Board of Education to review all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| contracts and agreements, no matter how big or small. The resolution I put forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3394)|
| 0:56:39| and the Board is considering does not mention anything about removing officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3399)|
| 0:56:42| not last week's version or this version. In fact, the resolution does not make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3402)|
| 0:56:46| single recommendation regarding the MOA, and I can't tell you how many people in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3406)|
| 0:56:50| the media and others have asked me what my recommendations are for the MOA, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3410)|
| 0:56:54| not one time have I given a response to that question, and the reason is if I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3414)|
| 0:56:59| that completely circumvents the intent of the resolution. The whole intent of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3419)|
| 0:57:03| the resolution is to get the community to the table. This is not about what I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| think the MOA should be or should say. It's about inviting the community whose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3428)|
| 0:57:13| kids we are stewarding to the table to have this conversation. It simply| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3433)|
| 0:57:20| outlined a public process for reviewing the MOA and offering recommendations, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| the reason it outlined a process is because I don't think you come to any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| meeting with a blank slate. It was an opportunity to have a straw man that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3447)|
| 0:57:31| could have dialogue about. The superintendent has been supportive of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3451)|
| 0:57:35| this resolution, as he stated last week at our meeting. I worked with him along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| the way in drafting this resolution. I did speak with parents, teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| administrators from various districts, central office staff, and other school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| systems even. Before the resolution was made public, Superintendent Thomas and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| discussed who would approach Mayor Kincannon, Chief Thomas, and Sheriff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3472)|
| 0:57:55| Spangler to ask if they would support the resolution. The superintendent agreed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| to reach out to Sheriff Spangler, and he did, and he can speak to what he heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| and I agreed to reach out to Mayor Kincannon and Chief Thomas. A few days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3484)|
| 0:58:08| later, after I sent the original resolution to her, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3488)|
| 0:58:13| did ask to see if she would support the resolution, and she did say that she| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3493)|
| 0:58:17| would, and she was interested in engaging in the community process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3497)|
| 0:58:21| Superintendent Thomas, again, can speak to what Sheriff Spangler told him. In my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| 20s and early 30s, I was a chaplain for the Knox County Sheriff's Office for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3505)|
| 0:58:28| seven years, and I had the utmost respect for law enforcement. I had the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3508)|
| 0:58:32| opportunity to partner with officers many times in helping navigate difficult| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3512)|
| 0:58:36| situations, having witnessed firsthand the pressures they are under. My| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3516)|
| 0:58:40| resolution is not a statement regarding law enforcement or the many men and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3520)|
| 0:58:44| women who serve. It is simply an opportunity to engage the public in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3524)|
| 0:58:48| facilitated conversations about what they would like to see regarding safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3528)|
| 0:58:53| and security in our schools, and I encourage any and all community members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3533)|
| 0:58:57| who have something to add to the dialogue to come out to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| meetings if and when they're scheduled. I've been working toward KCS reviewing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3540)|
| 0:59:04| this memorandum of agreement with KPD and KCSO since shortly after I came on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3544)|
| 0:59:08| the board in September 2020, long before any recent events at Austin East or in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3548)|
| 0:59:13| East Knoxville, and the very first parent to reach out to me with concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3553)|
| 0:59:17| regarding the current MOA is a District 3 parent. In fact, she has addressed this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3557)|
| 0:59:21| board twice now, and she addressed this board about her special-needs student,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3561)|
| 0:59:26| and I remember when she called me, the very first thing that I said is, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| could have been my son. I have a special-needs student, and I honestly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3570)|
| 0:59:34| pictured him being drugged down that hallway, and again, it's not, my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3574)|
| 0:59:38| statement is not an indictment on the police. It's to say when you have law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3578)|
| 0:59:42| enforcement from different agencies occupying the same space, we need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| real clear about how they're supposed to interact with one another, and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3586)|
| 0:59:50| current MOA is fairly vague, and that's not just my opinion, that's the opinion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3590)|
| 0:59:54| of other people who helped create the MOA, acknowledging that it's vague. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3594)|
| 1:00:03| throughout that time, Chief Bedousis, in my conversations with him, agreed over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| and over again that it is time to review the MOA. Not once did he express anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3607)|
| 1:00:11| different or to the contrary to me. I am committed to reviewing the current MOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3611)|
| 1:00:17| in a transparent, community-engaged process. I've looked to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| throughout my career and service, and I will continue to do so. I even ran on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3621)|
| 1:00:26| one of my priorities saying that the parents need to be viewed as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3626)|
| 1:00:29| valuable partners in education, and this is an extension of that. It is important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| for every student and parent to have the opportunity to speak into the agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3634)|
| 1:00:38| KCS has with local law enforcement. I also hope that this community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3638)|
| 1:00:41| conversation elevates the conversation around safety and security, even beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3641)|
| 1:00:45| the MOA. And as I stated last week, I'm a hundred percent confident that everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3645)|
| 1:00:52| in this room and beyond wants all our students to be safe and secure, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3652)|
| 1:00:57| also know that means very different things to different people. I know, as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| father of a black son and as a mixed daughter, that there will be a time, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| will be a day, when I have to have a conversation with him about how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| interact with the police. Right now, they are barring from my privilege, and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| is not, I'm not ignorant to that fact. And so, I'm living at the intersection of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| many of these conversations, and they're important conversations for everybody to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3679)|
| 1:01:23| be involved in. So, many people perceive safety and security, and it is shaped by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3683)|
| 1:01:33| our individual and communal experiences, our past traumas, and our current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3693)|
| 1:01:37| realities. And let me say this, this is going to be hard and messy. Absolutely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3697)|
| 1:01:44| it's going to be hard and messy if it's done right, but I also believe that all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3704)|
| 1:01:49| worthwhile endeavors are messy, but our kids are absolutely worth it. And so, let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3709)|
| 1:01:57| me speak to the specific resolution, briefly, that you have before you. So, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3717)|
| 1:02:01| did go back, and I listened to the board last week, and I appreciated the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3721)|
| 1:02:05| with the board. And basically, what I heard last week from the board is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3725)|
| 1:02:09| the board said, hey, we want to be at the table and help outline the process. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3729)|
| 1:02:11| think that's great. And so, what this new resolution does is basically say exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3731)|
| 1:02:20| that, that the board is agreeing to outline a community-engaged process to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3740)|
| 1:02:24| review the MOA. So, the way, I'm going to read just the four bullet points that got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3744)|
| 1:02:30| changed at the end, because I think it's important for the, for the board to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| understand the intent of this and also the community at large. So, after all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| whereas statements, it says, now, therefore, be it resolved by the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| County Board of Education, the board respectfully requests the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3762)|
| 1:02:45| Police Department and Knox County Sheriff's Department to enter into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| transparent community-engaged process to review and possibly amend the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3768)|
| 1:02:53| memorandum of agreement with the Board of Education. Be it further resolved, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3773)|
| 1:02:57| Board of Education, the Director of Schools, and the executive staff shall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3777)|
| 1:03:00| hold a publicly noticed meeting at the Andrew Johnson Building on May 19th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3780)|
| 1:03:03| 2021, from 1.30 to 3.30. So, just for the public's edification, the board's already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3783)|
| 1:03:10| had some internal conversations through our board secretary about that date and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3790)|
| 1:03:14| time, and that's been agreed upon. This MOA process review planning meeting shall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3794)|
| 1:03:19| have the sole objective of outlining a transparent community engagement process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3799)|
| 1:03:23| to review and possibly amend the current memorandum of agreement. Although this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3803)|
| 1:03:28| meeting is open to the public, it shall not include public forum. Be it further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| resolved, the Board of Education authorizes the Director of Schools to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| select and hire a skilled facilitator from outside of Knox County, Tennessee, at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3815)|
| 1:03:39| no cost, at a cost of no more than $1,000, including expenses to facilitate the MOA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3819)|
| 1:03:44| process review planning meeting. The purpose of securing an outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3824)|
| 1:03:48| facilitator is so that each Board of Education member, the Director of Schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3828)|
| 1:03:52| and the executive staff can fully engage in designing the process. If you're good,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3832)|
| 1:03:57| if you're facilitating, you cannot be engaged in outlining the process, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3837)|
| 1:04:01| that's the reason why we need a facilitator, can fully engage in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3841)|
| 1:04:05| designing the process to review the memorandum of agreement. Be it further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| resolved, the Board of Education shall hold a special called meeting at 430 on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3848)|
| 1:04:12| June 2nd, we already have a workshop scheduled that day at 5, to take possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3852)|
| 1:04:16| action regarding the community engagement process to review and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| possibly amend the memorandum of agreement. The reason why that date is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3859)|
| 1:04:22| set separately is because, from my understanding, we can't approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| process that we outlined on May 19th, on May 19th, so that's the next time that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| we're meeting. Obviously, all of this, from a timing perspective, is pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| important, given that I think everybody wants to see some resolution to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3875)|
| 1:04:40| prior to the start of school, so I think we need to work with haste. And then the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3880)|
| 1:04:44| final part is, be further resolved that this resolution shall take effect from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| and after its passage, the public welfare requiring it immediately be sent to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3887)|
| 1:04:51| Sheriff Tom Spangler, Chief Eve Thomas, Mayor India Kankana, Mayor Glenn Jacobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3891)|
| 1:04:55| and District Attorney Sean Allen. So, again, I'm excited about all the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3895)|
| 1:05:02| that I heard from this past week and prior to that, and there's nothing that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| I've heard that says that the community does not want to be involved in this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3906)|
| 1:05:10| conversation. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Watson. Board members, any comments or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3910)|
| 1:05:17| questions? Ms. Bounds? I'm sorry, Ms. Christie. I just, a couple of comments. First of all, I'd| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3917)|
| 1:05:28| like to hear a little bit about Superintendent Thomas's conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3928)|
| 1:05:33| with Sheriff Spangler, if you can share about that. Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| Christie. I spoke with Sheriff Spangler this afternoon for a few minutes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3937)|
| 1:05:41| talking about the MOA, and his comment to me was he would be, first of all, he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3941)|
| 1:05:48| wants to serve what the Board of Education wants. He made that very clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3948)|
| 1:05:51| that the partnership of the Board of Education has been important, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| what he wants to continue to be able to do. He is open to conversation with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3957)|
| 1:06:03| Memorandum of Agreement stakeholders, so he shared that with me, so that basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3963)|
| 1:06:08| those were his comments. Thank you, Superintendent. I guess, you know, my big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3968)|
| 1:06:16| concern is, do we want this in place by the start of the school year? Is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3976)|
| 1:06:23| that what you're saying? I worry about the timeline, and I had, Ms. Coatney had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3983)|
| 1:06:30| pulled up the timeline for the last process, and it was pretty lengthy, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| you know, it did start in the Disparities in Educational Outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=3996)|
| 1:06:42| Committee, and started in the fall of 2016, it looks like. I think Mr. Oaks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4002)|
| 1:06:49| might be able to speak to some of this, and there was some outside consultation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4009)|
| 1:06:57| with someone who was recognized as an expert in this field, but it was a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4017)|
| 1:07:06| very lengthy process. I believe it took two years, is that right, for us to get an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4026)|
| 1:07:13| with everyone, and that did include the community meetings, so yeah, I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4033)|
| 1:07:19| need to revisit it, definitely, and I would be very supportive of that, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4039)|
| 1:07:24| having those conversations with all the stakeholders, but I am a little concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4044)|
| 1:07:28| about the timeline, if we're saying that it needs to be done. Ms. Christie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4048)|
| 1:07:36| there's nothing in the resolution that speaks to an end date. So we would just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| keep the current one until we had a new one in place, is that? I mean, I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4060)|
| 1:07:46| suggesting anything different than that. I mean, we have an agreement. Obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4066)|
| 1:07:51| the mayor said that she is removing KPD from the agreement effective June 12th,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4071)|
| 1:07:56| so, I mean, at that point it'll be a two-party agreement, but yes, there's the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4076)|
| 1:08:02| I would expect that on May 19th, when we meet, we would outline a timeline. Okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4082)|
| 1:08:09| thank you, Ms. Christie. Ms. Valens? Yes, thank you. I appreciate Mr. Watson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4089)|
| 1:08:15| reworking his resolution and addressing the fellow board members' concerns. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4095)|
| 1:08:22| still have some concerns with the whereas's, and I would have mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4102)|
| 1:08:26| this last week, Daniel, except I didn't know you were going to rework the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4106)|
| 1:08:31| resolution and bring it back. The first eight whereas's are very factual and to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4111)|
| 1:08:41| point. I feel like whereas number nine and ten is a little bit more of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4121)|
| 1:08:50| platform or a... it's just a little bit more ambiguous. I know that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4130)|
| 1:08:58| superintendent, if he said it one time, he's probably said it a million. We all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4138)|
| 1:09:02| know his three priorities and one of his goals is to eliminate disparities, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4142)|
| 1:09:09| I'm very thankful for that being a part of his goal. However, in previous... for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4149)|
| 1:09:16| past seven years, we have not developed a policy where we've gone beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4156)|
| 1:09:25| mentioning names and groups, and so I'm very concerned about that. So I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4165)|
| 1:09:35| really don't feel like that I can support this resolution. I'm not sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| you're willing to strike whereas nine and ten, but I don't... Because they're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4179)|
| 1:09:45| numbered, I want to make sure I'm counting them correctly. It is whereas the Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4185)|
| 1:09:48| Education recognizes historical compounded trauma, and whereas the Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| of Education is deeply committed to affirming the lives of all students as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4194)|
| 1:09:59| evidenced. So it's those two, and I really just don't feel like we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4199)|
| 1:10:07| list all of those things in this particular resolution. I don't think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4207)|
| 1:10:12| consistent with what we've done in the past in the policy review meetings to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4212)|
| 1:10:17| list the work that we've been doing, and I don't think we can affirm black lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4217)|
| 1:10:23| unless we affirm other multi... Excuse me, we have a speaker. Excuse me. We have so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4223)|
| 1:10:32| many different nationalities and languages in our community, and in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4232)|
| 1:10:37| Excuse me, this is our meeting. Ms. Bounds is speaking. Excuse me. This is...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4237)|
| 1:10:48| Excuse me, you can sign up to speak at public forum next time we hold it. Ms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4248)|
| 1:10:52| Bounds has the floor. So we have the go to eliminate disparity, and as I said, to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4252)|
| 1:11:02| reiterate that in the past, the board has taken a position of not necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4262)|
| 1:11:08| naming everything or outlining specific groups, because once you start down that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4268)|
| 1:11:13| road, you may leave out a group. So it, you know, everybody has different opinions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4273)|
| 1:11:19| I'm just expressing mine that I can support this resolution, but not with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4279)|
| 1:11:26| whereas 9 and whereas 10. So if that remains in there, I will not be voting in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4286)|
| 1:11:32| favor of this resolution. Thank you. Thank you, Ms. Bounds. May I speak to Ms. Bounds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4292)|
| 1:11:37| Ms. Bounds, I appreciate your comments. I'm trying to get back actually to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4297)|
| 1:11:42| Knox County Schools webpage, but so both of those whereas statements, this the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4302)|
| 1:11:49| second one in particular, the where it says affirming black lives, that was the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4309)|
| 1:11:55| point of the Juneteenth resolution, which the board approved. So, so this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4315)|
| 1:12:02| resolution is not necessarily explicitly doing that. It is, it is talking about and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4322)|
| 1:12:07| communicating things, as you mentioned, that we've already done as a Board of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4327)|
| 1:12:10| Education and as a school system. I actually did not have a list in here in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4330)|
| 1:12:14| my first version, not that the board saw, but that the superintendent saw, and when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4334)|
| 1:12:18| I was going back and forth with the superintendent and his team, one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4338)|
| 1:12:22| things that they asked for is that we affirm some of the work that we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4342)|
| 1:12:26| trying to do in this space. So this was, that was out of deference for him and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4346)|
| 1:12:31| the many, many work, many, many years of work, the last five years of work that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4351)|
| 1:12:36| has come in this space, and so I don't think that I'm comfortable removing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4356)|
| 1:12:42| those two whereas statements. I do appreciate your thoughts and your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4362)|
| 1:12:47| opinion on that, but I don't know that anybody can deny that historical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4367)|
| 1:12:53| compounded trauma has affected people of color in this country, and, and also it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4373)|
| 1:13:00| not outside of precedent. Both our Juneteenth resolution and the resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4380)|
| 1:13:05| that was passed related to handcuffs with kids in elementary school both have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4385)|
| 1:13:11| similar language. So this is not the first time that this board has tackled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4391)|
| 1:13:17| with tough conversations in terms of the language and acknowledging some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4397)|
| 1:13:21| the historical oppression and trauma of others. I'm not comfortable removing those two, but I appreciate your thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4401)|
| 1:13:26| And that's okay, Mr. Watson. I totally expected that. I just don't think this is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4406)|
| 1:13:32| place for it. If the superintendent wants to speak to his, excuse me, if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4412)|
| 1:13:38| superintendent or someone on his staff wants to speak to their asking to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4418)|
| 1:13:43| to be included, I think all that work is important and I'm very proud as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4423)|
| 1:13:48| community and as a school board that we've done a lot of that. If this remains| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4428)|
| 1:13:52| in here, you will have to correct the addition of windows and mirrors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4432)|
| 1:13:57| curriculum. I talked with Miss Jackson today and that is not a curriculum as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4437)|
| 1:14:03| such. I think she explained it to me that it was more of a concept that we include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4443)|
| 1:14:09| literature where children can see themselves in that literature, but at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4449)|
| 1:14:17| least that was my understanding. It is not a curriculum and we have not adopted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4457)|
| 1:14:21| I can certainly change that word curriculum to concept. I actually took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4461)|
| 1:14:27| that exact, the addition of windows and mirrors curriculum, I took that exact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4467)|
| 1:14:31| language from the slide that the DEO had that referenced that. But if Shannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4471)|
| 1:14:38| Jackson is saying that it's more of a concept, she's the one that brought it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| to the table, so I completely respect that. And you can check with her, but I do know and I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4481)|
| 1:14:47| sure that, well I'll just leave it there because there's a lot of other policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4487)|
| 1:14:53| in place that would put parameters around the windows and mirrors concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| so and we can take those up in policy review. Thank you Miss Bounds and again| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4498)|
| 1:15:04| the purpose of this resolution isn't to define curriculum for Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| schools. It's simply simply outlining the opportunity to engage the community in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| conversation around school safety and security. Okay, thank you. Miss Henderson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4515)|
| 1:15:22| Thank you Madam Chair and Board. I appreciate Mr. Watson listening to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4522)|
| 1:15:27| board last week and taking our thoughts into consideration. I personally don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4527)|
| 1:15:32| think that a resolution is necessary to have community meetings and I want these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4532)|
| 1:15:38| conversations. I want these meetings. I just don't think a resolution is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4538)|
| 1:15:41| necessary to do that and also I would like to request, I completely agree with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4541)|
| 1:15:49| what Miss Christie said with the timeline. That is a concern for me as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| well. I don't think that this needs to be a rush process. I think that all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4552)|
| 1:15:56| stakeholders need to come to the table. Parents, students, the sheriff, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4556)|
| 1:16:02| police department, everybody needs to come to the table and so the timeline is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| a concern to me. So I would like to request from the superintendent that a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4565)|
| 1:16:09| letter be drafted asking the mayor to delay her June 12th deadline if possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4569)|
| 1:16:15| and that way we have time to come up with a thoughtful plan and really go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4575)|
| 1:16:23| all nine districts and see what every district needs. So thank you. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| Ms. Henderson. Ms. Babb. Yes I must sort of speak to this process too and I spoke| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4588)|
| 1:16:34| to this last week that I totally support having community conversations. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4594)|
| 1:16:38| that seems to be a resounding view. This is a another concern with me about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4598)|
| 1:16:45| is we are about to have a major change in personnel with Knox County Schools. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| have Mr. Pedusas, Chief Pedusas who has been serving us, who is retiring and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4610)|
| 1:16:56| will probably soon have a new person in that position that I think needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4616)|
| 1:17:01| very much at the table in these conversations. I think whoever that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4621)|
| 1:17:05| person might be, whether they're an internal person or somebody from outside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| they are going to have their own thoughts and hopefully their own| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| expertise that they will bring to the table. I want them to be a part of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| conversations and I think that that's just of utmost importance to me. I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4636)|
| 1:17:24| have the opportunity to speak to Mayor Kincannon today and I'm not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4644)|
| 1:17:28| speak for her, but I do feel like she is very willing and wants to continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4648)|
| 1:17:33| work with Knox County Schools and so I think that is just a conversation we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4653)|
| 1:17:36| need to have. I very much enjoyed my conversation with her and I felt like it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4656)|
| 1:17:40| was very positive today. I would like to very much, I really don't support this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4660)|
| 1:17:47| resolution, but I very much support us meeting as we all talked, or I think we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| all talked about, I don't know that we all agreed to it, I just know I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4671)|
| 1:17:54| talked to, about having the meeting on May 19th. I actually would support having| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4674)|
| 1:17:59| a facilitator. I do think that it's good to have someone kind of control the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4679)|
| 1:18:03| conversation, not people get off sidetracked, not let one person dominate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| I know I'm that kind of person that tends to over talk, so I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4687)|
| 1:18:12| facilitator can be helpful in that and I would like to, from there, move on to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4692)|
| 1:18:19| direction instead of right now, and I know that that's what you're kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4699)|
| 1:18:23| meaning, but you're already setting dates and things like that. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4703)|
| 1:18:29| sometimes we're kind of talking about the same thing but in a different way, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4709)|
| 1:18:33| I would like to have that, I still would like to have the May 19th meeting. I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4713)|
| 1:18:39| don't support this resolution and one of the other things is we talk a lot about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| what has happened in other schools, but we never even mentioned the fact that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4723)|
| 1:18:46| we've had two school shootings here prior to what's happened this spring in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4726)|
| 1:18:51| our school system itself and we never even addressed that that has a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4731)|
| 1:18:55| effect on what's going on in our school. So anyway, so I also do not support the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4735)|
| 1:19:01| resolution, but I do want to have conversations and I do think it needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4741)|
| 1:19:05| be a lot of people at the table. I want to hear from community members, I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4745)|
| 1:19:09| hear from our special ed teachers, I want to hear from our social workers, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| principals, our parents that are affected, but I really also really want that new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4753)|
| 1:19:19| person coming in in our security, head of security, to really be at the table in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4759)|
| 1:19:24| these conversations because I think they have to have the utmost, they're gonna| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| have to be really carrying it out and working with our partners going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4767)|
| 1:19:30| Thank you, Ms. Babb. Can we hear from Ms. Satterfield? Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4770)|
| 1:19:36| Madam Chair. So my ultimate goal with this resolution is to have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| conversation and so however that gets done, that gets done and I appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4780)|
| 1:19:45| that that the board is willing to have the May 19th date. I will continue to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4785)|
| 1:19:50| echo the sense of urgency to get some type of change in some type of solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4790)|
| 1:19:55| even if it takes school by school changes and not a whole district change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4795)|
| 1:19:58| because our response that has been done since the recent shootings has not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4798)|
| 1:20:05| has not been okay. It's very triggering to our students and so if we need to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4805)|
| 1:20:11| a process, a long process, and do school by school, I support that, but I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4811)|
| 1:20:15| like to see something different come August 2021 for especially for District| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4815)|
| 1:20:21| 1 schools and that I don't know what that looks like because we need to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| a community conversation. As for the new person that will come in, I would like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4823)|
| 1:20:30| flip it on the head a little bit and say this is what Knox County Schools, this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| what Knoxville community wants to see in leadership and so can you provide this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4833)|
| 1:20:38| and I think that that insight from our community might help. I don't know, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| haven't hired anybody in this position, but it could possibly help Superintendent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4842)|
| 1:20:46| Thomas to say who do we look for to meet these requirements and so I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4846)|
| 1:20:50| understand that they do need to be at the table and I think that we can guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4850)|
| 1:20:55| who we want in that position because that's a big position, that's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| serious position, especially what has happened and so we want to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| that that person knows our expectations before they come in and tell us their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4862)|
| 1:21:07| expectation. Thank you, Ms. Satterfield. I think Mr. Watson was next and then Ms. Christine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4867)|
| 1:21:16| Thank you, Ms. Henderson. I appreciate your comments about timing as well. Also, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4876)|
| 1:21:22| want to remind everybody, there's only two dates of this resolution related to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4882)|
| 1:21:26| timing and that's a meeting we agreed to and then there's a follow-up date to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| let's tell the community what we decided in terms of process. So this resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4890)|
| 1:21:34| does not recommend a specific time. The prior resolution did and I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4894)|
| 1:21:39| there's a sense of urgency as well in the sense that I don't think the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4899)|
| 1:21:42| community is going to want this process to take two years again and also to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4902)|
| 1:21:53| that point, work tends to constrict or expand given how much time you give it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4913)|
| 1:21:58| and if you tell something, if you tell a group of people the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4918)|
| 1:22:02| expectation is four, five, six months, that's what they'll shoot for. If you say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4922)|
| 1:22:07| let's take two years, that's what we'll shoot for and so I do think May 19th| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4927)|
| 1:22:12| when we meet, we do need to set a timetable and I think that needs to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| communicated. Out of all due respect, Ms. Babb, I can't, I really was caught| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4936)|
| 1:22:23| off guard by you saying you don't support the resolution when 99% of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4943)|
| 1:22:27| changes that I made were the changes you asked for. And honestly what I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4947)|
| 1:22:35| doing in making these changes was saying hey I'm listening to the board in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4955)|
| 1:22:40| same way I want to listen to the community. The reason I think it needs to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4960)|
| 1:22:44| pass in the form of resolution and not just let's go off and do this is because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4964)|
| 1:22:49| we need to understand that as a board no matter how well our intentions are, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4969)|
| 1:22:54| community does not always trust us. And I'm not speaking just about community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4974)|
| 1:23:00| members in this room maybe tonight, I'm talking about whenever I hear the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4980)|
| 1:23:04| transparent thrown around in a elected office capacity, almost nobody agree| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4984)|
| 1:23:10| what, agrees what that means and what that looks like. So the intent of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4990)|
| 1:23:13| resolution is to say to the community we want to hear from you, we're agreeing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4993)|
| 1:23:19| do that and we're going to sign off on that, that we're going to do that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=4999)|
| 1:23:23| it's going to look this way. Because unless we do that then the community has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5003)|
| 1:23:27| nothing to hold us accountable to. What we could do and I'm not saying we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5007)|
| 1:23:32| because I don't think it's our intent, but what we could do is go back in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| meeting on May 19th and set this process out, never vote on it and just start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5015)|
| 1:23:42| working for the next six months or a year. And that is against the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5022)|
| 1:23:47| concept of the resolution. The whole resolution is to say bring the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5027)|
| 1:23:52| to the table. You cannot do that unless you effectively communicate to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5032)|
| 1:23:57| community how that will work. And so that's why I think it needs to be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5037)|
| 1:24:01| resolution. I know several people expressed frustration that it came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5041)|
| 1:24:04| the form of a resolution, but we have very few tools as a board to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| things to the board as a whole. And I reviewed all the resolutions that we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| had over the last 10 years and many of them are very specific and handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| different issues. So again, out of deference for the board and what I was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| hearing last week, I struck my process because I did. The reason I did that and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5064)|
| 1:24:30| there was no pride in that is because I don't care about the mechanics of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5070)|
| 1:24:34| process. I care about bringing the community to the table in a way that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5074)|
| 1:24:39| they understand and that they're valued and that we make a commitment to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5079)|
| 1:24:43| community. And that's why I think the resolution needs to pass. Not because my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| name's on it, not because Miss Satterfield's name's on it, but because I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| think we owe it to the community to say if we're going to have a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5092)|
| 1:24:56| engaged process, we're going to commit to this in writing. We're going to say this is how we're going to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5096)|
| 1:25:03| So again, Miss Babb, out of all due respect, I tried to listen really well last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5103)|
| 1:25:10| And so I am a little surprised that you said you didn't like this version of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5110)|
| 1:25:14| because in some ways I thought it was your version. But again, I appreciate the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5114)|
| 1:25:21| dialogue, but I do think that we should tell the community how this is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| be done and be willing to say that publicly. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5125)|
| 1:25:30| Miss Christie. Yeah, so whether we like it or not, unfortunately, just the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5130)|
| 1:25:40| this has all played out, which was out of your control, I realize that. This is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5140)|
| 1:25:47| this document now seems to be an indictment on law enforcement. That seems| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5147)|
| 1:25:53| to be how the public is interpreting it. I mean, I've heard it from parents in my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5153)|
| 1:25:59| district. They're very concerned. And what I would like to see, because I do think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5159)|
| 1:26:04| that the conversation is important to have, but like you said, no one's saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| we should take law enforcement out of schools, but we need to have this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5169)|
| 1:26:13| conversation. What I would suggest doing is keeping the two meetings, but maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5173)|
| 1:26:20| even working on a resolution in the May 19th. I mean, I think if we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5180)|
| 1:26:26| have a resolution, it needs to be one we can all support, because I think that if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5186)|
| 1:26:29| we aren't all supportive, it's going to further divide. So my suggestion would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5189)|
| 1:26:36| definitely have the conversation. I get the urgency. We can move away from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5196)|
| 1:26:42| one-size-fits-all if we have to. We could go just district by district if we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5202)|
| 1:26:47| to. I mean, I can completely support all these things, but my problem with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5207)|
| 1:26:52| now is that I feel like you're asking, I do feel like this is an indictment on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5212)|
| 1:26:59| law enforcement, unfortunately. So I would rather keep the meetings, but not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5219)|
| 1:27:05| approve the resolution at this time. Thank you, Ms. Christie. Ms. Owen. Thank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5225)|
| 1:27:14| you, Madam Chair. I know there's been some talk about meetings that were prior to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5234)|
| 1:27:20| this MOA being adopted, but if we think back to 2019, when we discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5240)|
| 1:27:30| the MOA that's currently in effect, several of us had serious concerns that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5250)|
| 1:27:38| there had not been significant community input, that there had not been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5258)|
| 1:27:43| significant board input, that there had not been significant input from anyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5263)|
| 1:27:48| And if we look back at the way things were done leading up into 2016, what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5268)|
| 1:27:55| should remember is that this district used the Delphi method quite a lot, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5275)|
| 1:28:01| that method of seeking community input is a method that's specifically used to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5281)|
| 1:28:10| keep that input from being honestly relayed. It's a way of telling people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5290)|
| 1:28:18| what they think instead of finding out what people think, and that is, that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5298)|
| 1:28:25| transparency at all. Looking at this, Mr. Watson, I was really glad to hear you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5305)|
| 1:28:31| use the word sign-off a minute ago, because that's exactly how I read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5311)|
| 1:28:36| All this resolution does is provide some accountability to us, and if we can't sign| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5316)|
| 1:28:46| off on a resolution saying, yes, we are willing to meet, and we are willing to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5326)|
| 1:28:52| take community input, and we are willing to actually look at this MOA honestly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5332)|
| 1:28:57| and openly, I think there's a serious problem there. This is accountability for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5337)|
| 1:29:07| us, and we need to accept accountability for actually looking at this MOA and not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5347)|
| 1:29:13| just signing off on what somebody else hands us. Thank you, Ms. Owen, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5353)|
| 1:29:23| Thank you, Madam Chair. A couple of things, Mr. Watson, that concern me a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5363)|
| 1:29:33| little bit. You said you didn't want to have a public forum, but yet you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5373)|
| 1:29:46| involve the community. I mean, am I missing something, or, you know, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5386)|
| 1:29:53| talking about this May 19th deal. Mr. Watson. Yeah, so that's right, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5393)|
| 1:30:01| McMillan. So at that meeting, the board has a limited amount of time. It has two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| hours, is what the board has agreed to, and if that meeting is going to be facilitated by an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5406)|
| 1:30:11| outside group, then we don't have the luxury of having a public forum. The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5411)|
| 1:30:18| whole point of that meeting is to outline a process and a way to engage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| the public, and that certainly should happen, but I don't think in a two-hour| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| meeting, given the length of time our meetings have been recently, that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| hold public forum. I don't disagree with you on that point. I was just trying, it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5431)|
| 1:30:37| was just kind of like a mixed signal. I'm going to make sure I understood what you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5437)|
| 1:30:43| were saying. As far as the facilitator, I'm not sure that at the May 19th meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5443)|
| 1:30:58| we need a facilitator, because I've been around long enough to see several of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5458)|
| 1:31:09| these people, not with this subject matter, but with other things that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5469)|
| 1:31:15| brought in to facilitate, and some of them were good, some of them just, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5475)|
| 1:31:23| anybody with a decent amount of education could have kept the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5483)|
| 1:31:30| conversation going, and that's literally all they did. Some of them, and I'm talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5490)|
| 1:31:37| some time back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5497)|
| 1:31:40| Ms. Babb, you said you'd like to have all these people involved. I can't see you, even though I'm looking at you, but were you talking about having them come on May the 19th, or what were you thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5500)|
| 1:32:08| I mean, May 19th, I mean, I will agree. I think that is us, like our group, possibly some staff people that we think could weigh in, and I do like, I will say, I do like the facilitator. I don't really have a way in on who to, I do think sometimes we do need somebody to move the conversation along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5528)|
| 1:32:27| I agree, sometimes it needs to move me along. So, but I want the May 19th to be us, key staff people, in a conversational standpoint of talking about this. That's my thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5547)|
| 1:32:41| And that's it, no public forum, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5561)|
| 1:32:46| I agree with no public forum for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5566)|
| 1:32:50| I will agree with that, thus far. However, do you really think we need a facilitator for that meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5570)|
| 1:33:03| Honestly, I really do think it would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5583)|
| 1:33:08| You and the chair, now, I'm serious. Ms. Holman and yourself are the leadership for this board. Could we not have a meeting and you all direct, call whoever you wish?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5588)|
| 1:33:28| I would think that we would get further there without a facilitator, would be my thoughts. What are your thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5608)|
| 1:33:38| And honestly, Ms. Horn is the chair, so I probably would defer to her. I want us to all be part of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5618)|
| 1:33:47| I guess, I have worked, I have been involved with things where I've seen facilitators be very positive, and I guess you have a mixed bag. I mean, I see them as a positive influence, so that's my only thought on it, is I see the positive way to move the conversation along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5627)|
| 1:34:02| The reason I said that is, as the vice chair, the two of you make up the leadership of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5642)|
| 1:34:13| I feel like this is, I think, when I, I guess my initial reaction when I heard a policy review type meeting tossed around, to me, the reason we like the policy review type is because it is a little more informal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5653)|
| 1:34:29| It's not the formal setting that we have here, and that's when we tend to have very good conversation and work, is in an informal conversation like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5669)|
| 1:34:39| So, when I hear policy review, that's my thought. So, therefore, I was not initially thinking a facilitator because I'm thinking a more casual conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5679)|
| 1:34:50| And I'm not sure we're going to get into the meat of, I think that our May 19th meeting is going to be about process and not necessarily about what's included in an MOA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5690)|
| 1:35:02| So, I don't know that, I think it's about process, which I feel like we could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5702)|
| 1:35:07| I think you're right, and I think that's what the majority of the board desires for the May 19th meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5707)|
| 1:35:14| Now, one other thing, if, and we can talk about this at the May 19th meeting, assuming we don't have a facilitator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5714)|
| 1:35:27| I'd like to know more about who hires the facilitator or who appoints the facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5727)|
| 1:35:39| Does the board, if we're going to have one, I'm not saying we should, but if the board desires to have one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5739)|
| 1:35:48| I think it should be a collective effort and not just the superintendent or the superintendent and the chair, which make up the executive committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5748)|
| 1:35:59| Okay, thank you, Mr. McMillan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| That's just my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| Do you have a comment on that, Ms. Founds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| Yes, I think what Mr. McMillan is saying is what Ms. Christie actually presented at our last meeting, which is what you just reiterated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5763)|
| 1:36:12| which I think the board can support, is just at that first meeting, it being us working through things and going from there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5772)|
| 1:36:21| and not to eliminate Ms. Babb's desire to have a facilitator, but I think that needs to be part of the discussion at the May 19th meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5781)|
| 1:36:30| and I think that's what Ms. Christie asked for originally and kind of what I asked for when I asked you to set up that meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5790)|
| 1:36:37| So I think we all are saying the same thing, but just that first initial meeting, no facilitator, just us working through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5797)|
| 1:36:45| hearing each other out, listening really well, and moving on from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5805)|
| 1:36:50| Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5810)|
| 1:36:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5811)|
| 1:36:52| We need to obviously move on here, but we need to deal with that we have something on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5812)|
| 1:37:05| We need to deal with that and then have some discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5825)|
| 1:37:10| Yes, and I would like to actually speak to the resolution also, if I could, before we move to Mr. Watson and Ms. Satterfield,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5830)|
| 1:37:17| and then we do need to wrap up our conversation because I think then everybody would have had their say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5837)|
| 1:37:23| I agree with a lot of what other board members have said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5843)|
| 1:37:29| I think that we, I don't think a resolution like this is a way to invite our partners to the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5849)|
| 1:37:38| I just don't feel like this is an appropriate way to go about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5858)|
| 1:37:42| I feel like we need, I'm all for having a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| I think we need to sit down as a group, as we've talked about, in a couple of weeks and come up with what we want our plan to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5865)|
| 1:37:52| and who, and a timeline, and all of that, but I don't think, I think a resolution may come from that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5872)|
| 1:38:03| but I feel like we need to have a conversation and have a plan that we've all talked about together before we get to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5883)|
| 1:38:10| So for that reason, I will not be supporting this resolution today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5890)|
| 1:38:14| Mr. Watson and then Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5894)|
| 1:38:18| Okay, Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5898)|
| 1:38:21| To the facilitation aspect, I think that a facilitator can possibly present new ideas to what a community input type session would look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5901)|
| 1:38:31| That could be beneficial, but I also agree that we can be qualified board members and carry on a conversation as well, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5911)|
| 1:38:39| So either way, we go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| I do think, again, I do think an outside facilitator can present new ideas, something different from what KCS has always done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5921)|
| 1:38:48| But, board chair, I want to kind of, like, just speak to directly what you just shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5928)|
| 1:38:55| I think that that is our issue with Knox County Schools is that we're confusing who we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5935)|
| 1:39:03| We serve people and we serve community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5943)|
| 1:39:07| So when we abide by what other bodies in our community dictate, that's how we got into this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5947)|
| 1:39:16| Now, we don't know who runs our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5956)|
| 1:39:18| We don't know who runs our school system because we haven't taken the charge to say Knox County Schools runs Knox County Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5958)|
| 1:39:24| Principals run their schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| If you look at what happened, Knox County Schools did not run Austin East on that day, and that's a problem to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5967)|
| 1:39:34| So I think that we have to set the tone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5974)|
| 1:39:36| Excuse me. I can't hear Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5976)|
| 1:39:38| I think that we have to set the tone that we run Knox County Schools and that that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5978)|
| 1:39:44| So I just want to remind us who we serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| Thank you, Ms. Satterfield. Mr. Watson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5988)|
| 1:39:56| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| I want to just briefly recenter the students in this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=5998)|
| 1:40:05| I think especially because of the actions of others last week, the students were not the center of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6005)|
| 1:40:14| What became the center of the conversation, even to Ms. Christie's point a few minutes ago, is law enforcement became the center of the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6014)|
| 1:40:22| And the conversation became about do I love police? Do I not love police? Who loves police more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6022)|
| 1:40:29| And that's not the conversation that we're having.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6029)|
| 1:40:33| What I'm trying to have is a conversation about how to best provide the safety and security of our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6033)|
| 1:40:39| And it feels odd to me that we're nitpicking about a resolution that says we're going to have conversations when we're all saying we want to have conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6039)|
| 1:40:53| I in the idea of a facilitator, I want to be clear about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6053)|
| 1:40:58| The idea of a facilitator in this resolution is not hiring a facilitator that would facilitate this whole process from beginning to end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6058)|
| 1:41:07| It's out of deference and respect to the board that when you're doing hard community work, which this will be hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6067)|
| 1:41:17| This is this is not a policy review discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6077)|
| 1:41:20| This is not about what do we need to change legally in this form to make this right or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6080)|
| 1:41:25| This is a get down to the nitty gritty as a group of people and say, here's the best way to invite our community in this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6085)|
| 1:41:34| And out of respect for everybody on this board, I want each of you to be 100 percent engaged in that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6094)|
| 1:41:41| And if it's a free for all conversation or one person in this body is tasked with leading that conversation, 100 percent of the members here can't be involved in the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6101)|
| 1:41:53| That's not the way it's an impossibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| You cannot facilitate a conversation like this and be fully involved in it, because if you do, you bring your bias into it, which is the which is the whole point of a facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6116)|
| 1:42:09| And so, again, I'm I'm a little lost, honestly, about why we're nitpicking a really stripped down version of things we've already agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6129)|
| 1:42:19| And I spoke to Ms. Cody this week after I think she pulled all of about a facilitator.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6139)|
| 1:42:26| And at that point, she only mentioned one who said that did not want a facilitator of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6146)|
| 1:42:31| So, again, I'm not sure. Again, I don't think we're centering the students in the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6151)|
| 1:42:37| And all I would ask is if you all agree that we should meet and lay out a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6157)|
| 1:42:42| There's nothing wrong with this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| OK, thank you. OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6167)|
| 1:42:51| OK, we're Miss Coney. Can we have a roll call vote, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6171)|
| 1:42:58| You can start with district nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6178)|
| 1:43:02| Either way, either one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| Miss Christie. No. Mr. Macmillan. No. Miss Bounds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6186)|
| 1:43:11| Miss Henderson. Miss Bob. Mr. Watson. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6191)|

| 1:43:22| Three yes votes and six no. Motion fails. Thank you, Miss Coney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6202)|
| 1:43:28| Excuse me. Order, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6208)|
| 1:43:41| Excuse me. You can sign up to speak at public forum in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6221)|

| 1:43:49| Item 10D. Approved suspension of Knox County Board of Education Policy B200| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6229)|

| 1:44:04| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6244)|
| 1:44:09| Second. OK, we have a motion by Miss Christie, a second by Miss Bob. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6249)|
| 1:44:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6254)|
| 1:44:19| Anytime we suspend our own rules, we should have a really good reason for doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6259)|
| 1:44:24| And it's suspending our rules should not be the norm. It shouldn't just be our go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6264)|
| 1:44:29| when we want to get something done. Every action that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6269)|
| 1:44:34| every action that we have taken on this policy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| we have suspended the rules. And the only time it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6279)|
| 1:44:44| really urgent was the first time we looked at the policy when it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6284)|
| 1:44:49| in August and we were looking at putting it in place to support our principals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6289)|
| 1:44:54| so that they could have very clear expectations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6294)|
| 1:44:59| in their schools. And at that time, there wasn't time for them to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6299)|
| 1:45:04| to do that at the beginning of the year if we had moved it on to a second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6304)|
| 1:45:09| So I object to suspending the rules because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6309)|
| 1:45:14| it's becoming habitual. Thank you. Thank you, Miss Allen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6314)|
| 1:45:19| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| All in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6324)|

| 1:46:19| I forgot we have public forum. So sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6379)|
| 1:46:24| Okay, public forum. I think we don't need to read the policy again. Hopefully everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6384)|
| 1:46:29| understands the rules of public forum. We'll start with Sarah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6389)|
| 1:46:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6394)|
| 1:46:39| Okay, we are going because we have quite a few speakers on this topic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6399)|
| 1:46:44| We are going to take a 10-minute break and then we will get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=6404)|

| 1:58:49| My name is Sarah Wilson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7129)|
| 1:58:50| I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7130)|
| 1:58:51| Let me first say that I support our officers and deeply appreciate their service in protecting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7131)|
| 1:58:58| our children and would never want to see them removed from our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| I'm very grateful that the community is coming to the table to have a discussion, and I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7142)|
| 1:59:07| very much in support of transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7147)|
| 1:59:10| So speaking of transparency, let's talk about what that means for KCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7150)|
| 1:59:14| Webster's definition of transparent is free from pretense or deceit, characterized by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7154)|
| 1:59:19| visibility or accessibility of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7159)|
| 1:59:22| When you are transparent, you have no wrongdoings to hide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7162)|
| 1:59:25| You stand in a place of integrity and accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7165)|
| 1:59:29| Expectations are clearly represented and followed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7169)|
| 1:59:32| We can talk about transparency and integrity, but when it comes to practical application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7172)|
| 1:59:37| the question I want to ask you is, is KCS honoring this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7177)|
| 1:59:42| Is KCS being transparent in their reopening plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7182)|
| 1:59:46| One of the cornerstones of the reopening plan is the metric system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7186)|
| 1:59:50| Superintendent Thomas says in his reopening plan concerning the metrics that we will need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7190)|
| 1:59:55| your flexibility and it will be revisited continuously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7195)|
| 2:00:00| These are exact quotes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7200)|
| 2:00:02| This statement was to get the point across that we must ebb and flow with how the virus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7202)|
| 2:00:05| is acting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| Last Thursday, several parents noticed that the metrics went to all green with the exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7207)|
| 2:00:11| of custodial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7211)|
| 2:00:12| I have that for you right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7212)|
| 2:00:15| With the exception of custodial, this very school board has said in meetings that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7215)|
| 2:00:19| never have enough custodial staff even in a normal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7219)|
| 2:00:23| Were the metrics set up that way purposely so that we were guaranteed to never go all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7223)|
| 2:00:27| green?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7227)|
| 2:00:28| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7228)|
| 2:00:29| I would love to know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7229)|
| 2:00:31| This is not transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7231)|
| 2:00:33| When parents noticed on Thursday that all the pertinent metrics were green, several| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7233)|
| 2:00:38| emailed and called Superintendent Thomas' office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7238)|
| 2:00:40| The office responded with, we made a promise to virtual students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7240)|
| 2:00:45| We would follow the reopening plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| Well, by golly, you absolutely did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7247)|
| 2:00:50| The problem is KCS is not understanding its own policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7250)|
| 2:00:54| The policy calls for us to follow the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| That's what metrics are, numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7257)|
| 2:01:00| It is not someone else's personal, professional, or even medical opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7260)|
| 2:01:04| It is not a guarantee to virtual students that we will not ever go green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7264)|
| 2:01:09| Metrics are specific numbers you follow to make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| Let me ask you, what are those exact numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7272)|
| 2:01:16| What specific numbers determine when or why we go from green to yellow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7276)|
| 2:01:21| Those numbers were never provided to Knox County parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7281)|
| 2:01:25| This is not transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7285)|
| 2:01:27| To even further point out the lack of transparency and dishonesty within our system, the metric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7287)|
| 2:01:31| system, according to KCS policy, is to be updated at 4 p.m. every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7291)|
| 2:01:36| At 4.04 on Thursday, those parents, on last Thursday, those parents called and emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7296)|
| 2:01:42| began pouring in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7302)|
| 2:01:43| And then guess what happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7303)|
| 2:01:44| At 10.30 a.m. the next morning, before metrics were even supposed to be updated, the metrics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7304)|
| 2:01:50| had magically changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| We were all of a sudden on red and yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| How in the world did that happen in a matter of less than 18 hours?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7314)|
| 2:01:59| I checked the number of COVID cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| Those numbers did not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7321)|
| 2:02:02| This is not just a lack of transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7322)|
| 2:02:04| This is dishonesty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7324)|
| 2:02:05| Knox County has approximately 60,000 students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7325)|
| 2:02:08| 43,000 of them have been in person this entire school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7328)|
| 2:02:11| Second semester, 7,000 of those virtual students came back in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7331)|
| 2:02:15| So are you telling every Knox County parent that the 7,000 virtual students are more valuable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7335)|
| 2:02:20| to you than the 43,000 that have hunkered down and fought through this all year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7340)|
| 2:02:25| KCS made no promises to virtual students that we would never take our masks off or be normal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7345)|
| 2:02:30| again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7350)|
| 2:02:31| The only promise that was made to all 60,000 students and their parents was that you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7351)|
| 2:02:36| follow the metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7356)|
| 2:02:38| Furthermore, this board and the superintendent now know that a Tennessee judge has made a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7358)|
| 2:02:42| ruling in Williamson County that school boards are not within their legal rights in Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7362)|
| 2:02:47| to require face coverings in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7367)|
| 2:02:50| Therefore, you are now officially put on notice that you are personally liable for knowingly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7370)|
| 2:02:54| using your office to create harmful policies over the people for which you have no legal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7374)|
| 2:02:59| authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| Therefore, I am asking someone on this board to bring forward an amendment to Ms. Babb's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7381)|
| 2:03:05| proposal to end the face covering policy for which you have no legal standing effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7385)|
| 2:03:11| immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7391)|
| 2:03:12| It should not stop there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7392)|
| 2:03:13| I implore someone on this board to take a stand and propose an amendment that we immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7393)|
| 2:03:19| dismiss the reopening plan due to the lack of transparency and dishonesty embedded within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7399)|
| 2:03:25| and allow our children one week of normal to end this horrible school year on a better| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7405)|
| 2:03:29| note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7409)|
| 2:03:30| Also, in case anybody wants to know, this is the metrics for yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7410)|
| 2:03:36| Every one of them is green except for custodial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7416)|
| 2:03:40| This is printed right off the KCS website and also very parents, very few parents know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7420)|
| 2:03:45| that these metrics are not just COVID metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7425)|
| 2:03:47| They include all absences, whether that be from sickness, vacations, end of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7427)|
| 2:03:52| skipping, whatever that may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7432)|
| 2:03:53| It doesn't even relate to COVID completely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7433)|
| 2:03:56| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7436)|
| 2:03:57| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7437)|

| 2:04:06| If you will state your name and county of residence, you'll have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7446)|
| 2:04:12| Hello.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7452)|
| 2:04:13| My name is Rebecca Reeves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7453)|
| 2:04:14| I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7454)|
| 2:04:15| Today, I'm going to talk about two dangerous words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7455)|
| 2:04:19| It's only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7459)|
| 2:04:20| It's only 14 days to slow the spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7460)|
| 2:04:22| It's only a piece of cloth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7462)|
| 2:04:24| It's only for your own good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7464)|
| 2:04:26| It's only for your protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7466)|
| 2:04:27| It's only 14 police officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7467)|
| 2:04:29| It's only to start a conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7469)|
| 2:04:31| It's only is a dangerous phrase that opens a door that should have never been opened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7471)|
| 2:04:35| in the first place because once opened, it's almost impossible to close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7475)|
| 2:04:39| And second, many times, you don't even have the authority or legal standing to open the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7479)|
| 2:04:42| door in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7482)|
| 2:04:44| And now that it's opened, we're in a real pickle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7484)|
| 2:04:47| So as the doorway gets clogged, as it gets bigger and bigger, and soon there isn't a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| door anymore, but just a wide open space with no boundaries and borders and no control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7490)|
| 2:04:55| Soon, we're just free falling and making up sloppy rules as we go with no way to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7495)|
| 2:04:58| how they really started or how they end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| And this is where we are, a huge gaping, wide open mess that started out with, well, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7500)|
| 2:05:04| only and hiding behind the recommendations of a certain health professional who also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7504)|
| 2:05:09| has no authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7509)|
| 2:05:10| And now we have no way to know who can end this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7510)|
| 2:05:13| I called the school and the school board back in August of 2020, pretty upset when I learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7513)|
| 2:05:18| my five and six year olds were going to be in a mask all day long, not just in the hallways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7518)|
| 2:05:23| as I was originally told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7523)|
| 2:05:25| So they're going to have to sit distance and lunch, no hugs, and it just seemed like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7525)|
| 2:05:28| really cruel and cold environment for a small child who's been home her whole life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7528)|
| 2:05:33| So I send her into this cold environment with no touching, sitting spaced out at lunch,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7533)|
| 2:05:37| no hugs if you fall and skin your knee, just send her off into this building I'm not even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7537)|
| 2:05:41| allowed into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7541)|
| 2:05:42| I can't even walk down the whole sidewalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7542)|
| 2:05:44| There's two orange cones that reminded me of where my place is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7544)|
| 2:05:47| So here you go, sweetie, go inside, but don't touch or hug.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7547)|
| 2:05:50| There's going to be a bunch of people in there with just their eyes peeping out at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7550)|
| 2:05:52| you, but you can't see the rest of their face or their expressions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7552)|
| 2:05:55| And most people look totally different without their masks on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7555)|
| 2:05:58| So I called really upset and I was assured time and time again, that it was only for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7558)|
| 2:06:02| a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7562)|
| 2:06:03| It was only for just a little while to please trust us that as the metrics change and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7563)|
| 2:06:07| go green, we will relax restrictions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7567)|

| 2:06:19| Because we feed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7579)|
| 2:06:20| It's not based on what's actually happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7580)|
| 2:06:22| Our COVID metrics keep going green except for custodial, but we keep caving to a group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7582)|

| 2:06:30| The majority of the small amount of hospitalized children were hospitalized out of an abundance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7590)|
| 2:06:34| of caution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7594)|

| 2:06:43| caving to them because when you do, it justifies unjust fear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7603)|
| 2:06:48| And I'm very sorry for those of you who live in this intense fear and I really am because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7608)|
| 2:06:52| that's an awful way to live, but justifying fear that doesn't and shouldn't live here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7612)|

| 2:09:52| covering their nose and mouth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7792)|
| 2:09:54| Per the FDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7794)|
| 2:09:57| The FDA regulates face masks, including cloth face coverings, and surgical masks as medical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7797)|
| 2:10:03| devices when they are marketed for medical purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7803)|
| 2:10:06| Medical purposes include uses related to COVID-19, such as face masks to help stop the spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7806)|

| 2:10:23| for use in construction and other industrial applications, are not medical devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7823)|
| 2:10:28| Still, where does this school board and superintendent derive their authority to require our children| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7828)|
| 2:10:33| to wear face coverings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7833)|
| 2:10:36| It has been argued that TCA 49-2-203, Section A, Paragraph 2, gives you that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7836)|
| 2:10:44| That states, it is the duty of the local Board of Education to manage and control all public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7844)|
| 2:10:49| schools established or that may be established under its jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7849)|
| 2:10:54| But does that give you blanket authority over our children?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7854)|
| 2:10:58| You claim you have the right to require our children to wear a medical device.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7858)|

| 2:11:09| regarding their mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7869)|
| 2:11:12| While much of the case was dismissed due to standing, there is one section that the Williamson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7872)|
| 2:11:15| County Board of Education lost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7875)|
| 2:11:18| And I quote, this court is not convinced as a matter of law that Williamson County Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7878)|
| 2:11:24| of Education acted within its statutory authority at the time it promulgated its face covering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7884)|
| 2:11:29| requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7889)|
| 2:11:30| And the court is particularly unconvinced that Williamson County Board of Education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7890)|
| 2:11:35| has continuing authority to enforce its face covering requirements in light of recent policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7895)|
| 2:11:40| decisions by Williamson County Mayor and Governor Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7900)|
| 2:11:43| That includes Governor Lee's lifting the public health orders and I would say it also includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7903)|
| 2:11:48| our own mayor lifting our county mask mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7908)|

| 2:11:56| is not viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7916)|
| 2:11:59| It further states that the courts cannot find as a matter of law defendants have acted within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7919)|
| 2:12:04| the authority given to them by the legislature when enacting face covering requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7924)|
| 2:12:09| While you may believe that only applies to Williamson County Schools, let me correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7929)|
| 2:12:13| you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7933)|

| 2:12:30| 11th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7950)|

| 2:12:37| While I understand that what is on the table is to sunset it on May 26th, you still have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7957)|
| 2:12:42| no authority in Tennessee Code to continue requirements for masking now or two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7962)|

| 2:13:07| So I want to begin with what has just recently been posted on CNN by the radical far right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7987)|
| 2:13:15| wing nut job, Dr. Fauci.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=7995)|

| 2:13:27| So what do you all know as an administrative body that the guy I think has gotten it wrong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8007)|
| 2:13:33| all year doesn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8013)|
| 2:13:35| But let's set that aside because I think there's going to be plenty of compelling speech to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8015)|
| 2:13:39| that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8019)|
| 2:13:41| What I'd like to point out to you all so that you're aware of what you've been a party to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8021)|
| 2:13:45| is that tonight you have allowed your authority to be usurped by the PBA and you're now currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8025)|
| 2:13:52| engaged in viewpoint discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8032)|
| 2:13:55| I sent several of you emails stating that it was my intent, along with the PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8035)|

| 2:14:07| of political speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8047)|
| 2:14:10| I have a right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8050)|
| 2:14:11| The PBA, possibly Knox County schools by not controlling your own meeting, have now engaged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8051)|
| 2:14:17| in viewpoint discrimination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8057)|
| 2:14:18| The reason why I can say that is allow me to read you the response I got from the PBA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8058)|

| 2:14:29| It's from Jane, the director of the PBA, and it basically, so I don't waste my time, I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8069)|
| 2:14:37| paraphrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8077)|
| 2:14:38| She said that this is a courthouse, and so based on that and the ruling of the Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8078)|
| 2:14:42| State Supreme Court that you have to use masks in courthouse facilities, that that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8082)|
| 2:14:47| they're applying this to everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8087)|
| 2:14:50| Well, as I count it right now, there's one, two, three, four, five, and there was six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8090)|
| 2:14:58| people sitting in the downstairs gallery that are not socially distanced, and those plexiglass| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8098)|
| 2:15:04| screens are worthless for preventing the spread of a virus through the air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8104)|
| 2:15:09| Sitting in the gallery, sitting in the downstairs area without face masks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8109)|
| 2:15:14| So I notified you that I was coming to engage in political speech.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8114)|
| 2:15:18| I told you what it was going to be, and I was barred at the door and threatened with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8118)|
| 2:15:21| removal from the building if I engaged in that behavior while other people are being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8121)|
| 2:15:27| permitted to engage in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8127)|
| 2:15:29| As a matter of fact, all the elected officials of Knox County sat down there a week ago with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8129)|
| 2:15:34| the mayor shoulder to shoulder, not wearing one mask among them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8134)|
| 2:15:39| And last week at the last board meeting you all had, another citizen sat in the gallery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8139)|
| 2:15:44| area on video without a mask on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8144)|
| 2:15:47| So when they're informed I'm coming to sit there just like you are, just like those other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8147)|
| 2:15:53| parties did in the lower gallery for the purpose of political speech, they prevented and barred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8153)|
| 2:15:59| me access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8159)|
| 2:16:00| They said coming upstairs in a separate but equal space is satisfactory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8160)|
| 2:16:05| I believe there was a school board involved in such a decision in the past, and it didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8165)|
| 2:16:09| turn out well for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8169)|
| 2:16:11| It turned out well for the parties that were fighting them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8171)|
| 2:16:13| I think we're facing that same reality now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8173)|
| 2:16:16| So I expect you all to behave better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8176)|
| 2:16:20| Take control of your own meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8180)|
| 2:16:22| Don't let this flim flam nonsense go on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8182)|
| 2:16:25| This is a public building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8185)|
| 2:16:26| If the public building authority is a private entity, and you all are being led around by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8186)|
| 2:16:30| the nose by them in your own building, then stand up and lobby the county commission to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8190)|
| 2:16:35| take control of the public property in this county, and not let bullies and thugs run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8195)|
| 2:16:41| your own meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8201)|
| 2:16:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8203)|
| 2:16:44| Please state your name, county of residence, and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8204)|
| 2:16:56| My name is Hillary Godsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8216)|
| 2:16:57| I'm from Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8217)|
| 2:16:58| I also kind of wanted to talk about transparency tonight, because I spent a lot of time on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8218)|
| 2:17:04| the phone with a lot of you, and people in the central office, my principal, who else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8224)|
| 2:17:12| There's a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8232)|
| 2:17:13| A lot of hours spent on the phone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8233)|
| 2:17:17| And it came down to, I remember the superintendent talking about the 72.6% of people that said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8237)|
| 2:17:23| they wanted to keep masks for the rest of the school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8243)|
| 2:17:26| That was the percentage that we were given.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8246)|
| 2:17:28| Well, then I started thinking about it, and I was like, I work at these schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8248)|
| 2:17:31| I go and I serve the teachers and the principals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8251)|
| 2:17:35| And every single person, I never talk to them first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8255)|
| 2:17:38| They come to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8258)|
| 2:17:40| Every single person wants the mask on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8260)|
| 2:17:43| And I said, I can't understand the percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8263)|
| 2:17:46| Everybody that's coming and talking to me doesn't want the mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8266)|
| 2:17:49| I've yet to meet one person that wants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8269)|
| 2:17:51| So how are these numbers coming about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8271)|
| 2:17:53| So I talked to somebody in the central office, and this is what they said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8273)|
| 2:17:57| There were 650 people pulled for that percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8277)|
| 2:18:01| 472 of them said that they wanted to keep masks on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8281)|
| 2:18:05| There are 10,000 employees, teachers, in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8285)|
| 2:18:10| That is less than 10% of them that are saying that they want the masks on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8290)|
| 2:18:14| That doesn't really add up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8294)|
| 2:18:16| Not only that, they said that they wanted to keep masks for summer school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8296)|
| 2:18:20| Of that 650, 60% said that they wanted, of 10,000 teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8300)|
| 2:18:27| That doesn't add up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8307)|
| 2:18:29| So when you're giving us these percentages, you can't just leave the percentages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8309)|
| 2:18:32| You have to give us the numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8312)|
| 2:18:33| You have to be transparent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8313)|
| 2:18:36| Now we're getting into the field day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8316)|
| 2:18:38| And I know a lot of you have gotten emails about field day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8318)|
| 2:18:41| It's going back to the metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8321)|
| 2:18:43| They're all green except for one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8323)|
| 2:18:45| Your custodians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8325)|
| 2:18:46| It's outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8326)|
| 2:18:48| The policy, your policy says that you don't need to have masks on outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8328)|
| 2:18:53| So there's two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8333)|
| 2:18:54| You're outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8334)|
| 2:18:55| You don't have to wear a mask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8335)|
| 2:18:56| You can be socially distanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8336)|
| 2:18:57| But yet parents still can't come and participate in one event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8337)|
| 2:19:00| We've given up the whole year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8340)|
| 2:19:01| We've been compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8341)|
| 2:19:02| We've had grace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8342)|
| 2:19:03| But our grace is running out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8343)|
| 2:19:05| Because now you will have taken a whole entire year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8345)|
| 2:19:09| It's not fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8349)|
| 2:19:11| It's not fair to the kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8351)|
| 2:19:12| It's not fair to the parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8352)|
| 2:19:13| And it's not fair to the teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8353)|
| 2:19:15| Because you guys are putting this on teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8355)|
| 2:19:18| In the central office, they didn't even know who it was that was given the authority to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8358)|
| 2:19:22| make us go green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8362)|
| 2:19:24| I was told it was a school board, that they had a vote on it from the central office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8364)|
| 2:19:29| That's what they're telling parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8369)|
| 2:19:31| But it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8371)|
| 2:19:32| I called the board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8372)|
| 2:19:33| All of them said, we don't have that authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8373)|
| 2:19:36| That's out of the superintendent's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8376)|
| 2:19:38| So if you guys can't even get on the same page, how are we supposed to be on the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8378)|
| 2:19:41| page that you're on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8381)|
| 2:19:44| I appreciate your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8384)|
| 2:19:45| Chrissy Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8385)|
| 2:19:46| If you'll state your name, county of residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8386)|
| 2:19:47| You have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8387)|
| 2:19:48| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8388)|
| 2:19:49| My name is Chrissy Stevens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8389)|
| 2:19:50| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8390)|
| 2:19:51| I thought I would just start by saying I'm here, so that I could tell my children that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8391)|
| 2:20:04| I will always fight for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8404)|
| 2:20:07| After spending hours preparing for tonight and typing out pages of notes of science and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8407)|
| 2:20:11| facts, I decided to trash it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8411)|
| 2:20:15| I was going to talk to you about the vote on ending the mask policy immediately in Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8415)|
| 2:20:20| County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8420)|
| 2:20:21| But then I decided you probably have already decided how you're going to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8421)|
| 2:20:26| I was going to remind you that boards of health and the CDC can only make recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8426)|
| 2:20:32| And recommendations come with choice to follow them or not to follow them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8432)|
| 2:20:38| Guidelines are not laws and emergency use authorization does not mean approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8438)|
| 2:20:43| I was going to tell you how the COVID-19 virus has spread, citing the CDC's website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8443)|
| 2:20:50| And I quote, COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through, and maybe you didn't catch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8450)|
| 2:20:56| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8456)|
| 2:20:57| So let me repeat it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8457)|
| 2:20:58| COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8458)|
| 2:21:03| So I want you to remember that word thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8463)|
| 2:21:05| The CDC thinks they know how COVID-19 is spread.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8465)|
| 2:21:09| You can look it up for yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8469)|
| 2:21:13| I know that you all hide behind the CDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8473)|
| 2:21:15| Many organizations do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8475)|
| 2:21:16| Well, we're just doing what the CDC recommends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8476)|
| 2:21:18| And did you know that members of the CDC's advisory committee on immunization practices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8478)|
| 2:21:24| own more than 50 vaccine patents or own stock shares connected to pharmaceutical companies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8484)|
| 2:21:32| that manufacture vaccines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8492)|
| 2:21:34| This is an obvious conflict of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8494)|
| 2:21:36| And I mention it only because there are people, many in this room, that falsely believe that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8496)|
| 2:21:41| the CDC is an impartial and unbiased government entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8501)|
| 2:21:46| I'd like to now talk to the parents listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8506)|
| 2:21:48| And I hope you're listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8508)|
| 2:21:50| I believe you have the right to choose how to keep yourself and your children as healthy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8510)|
| 2:21:55| or as unhealthy as you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8515)|
| 2:21:57| But your children are not the property of Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8517)|

| 2:24:01| I live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8641)|
| 2:24:03| I first want to thank the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8643)|
| 2:24:05| I want to thank you guys for listening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8645)|

| 2:24:14| I have four children in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8654)|
| 2:24:16| Normally, my time during a school year would consist of one day a week volunteering in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8656)|
| 2:24:20| the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8660)|
| 2:24:21| I've made friends with several of the teachers over the five years that we've been here and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8661)|
| 2:24:24| have dedicated my Tuesdays to helping them in their classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8664)|
| 2:24:27| I've helped with reading comprehension, math, catching up on Mr. Late Work, helping with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8667)|
| 2:24:31| projects, basically anything that they needed me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8671)|
| 2:24:35| In the two years before the school year, I volunteered in classes where my children weren't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8675)|
| 2:24:39| even attending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8679)|
| 2:24:41| This is how I prefer to spend my time when concerning my students, my schools, their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8681)|
| 2:24:45| needs, any of that, by helping those on the front lines of education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8685)|
| 2:24:50| This year, parents were not allowed to volunteer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8690)|
| 2:24:53| I can't imagine that this has had anything but a negative impact on the students and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8693)|

| 2:25:03| At the end of this school year, I find myself spending my hours and days on a weekly and,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8703)|
| 2:25:07| at this point, daily basis trying to fight the policies that Knox County Schools has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8707)|
| 2:25:11| imposed on our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8711)|
| 2:25:13| In the past week, I've spent hours trying to clarify the current policy that we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8713)|
| 2:25:19| with the law director, the executive director of secondary education, my school board representative,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8719)|
| 2:25:24| our principal, our teachers at our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8724)|
| 2:25:27| In all of those conversations, an underlying theme has emerged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8727)|
| 2:25:31| There are differing views on the current school policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8731)|
| 2:25:34| Even with statements made to clarify and understood by this board, such as, Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8734)|
| 2:25:39| has no face covering policy regarding to outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8739)|
| 2:25:42| We still have Knox County Schools staff that are enforcing face coverings outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8742)|
| 2:25:47| It has been left up to interpretation, and this concerns me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8747)|
| 2:25:52| We've heard conversations this past week between board members that differ on what the term| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8752)|
| 2:25:55| recommended means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8755)|
| 2:25:57| Again, this is left up to interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8757)|
| 2:26:00| Regarding the school COVID metrics, we've been watching for several days while the numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8760)|
| 2:26:03| stay the same or decline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8763)|
| 2:26:04| On May 6th, as one of my friends pointed out, we had six positive COVID staff members and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8764)|
| 2:26:09| 17 quarantined out of 10,129 total staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8769)|
| 2:26:17| Six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8777)|
| 2:26:19| We were green in all metrics except for custodial staff, which was yellow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8779)|
| 2:26:22| Not sure how it was yellow when we have six positive staff members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8782)|
| 2:26:27| On May 7th, we still had six COVID positive and 17 quarantined, and yet we moved to yellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8787)|
| 2:26:34| for staff attendance and red for custodial support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8794)|
| 2:26:38| How is there zero change in COVID numbers, and yet the color changes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8798)|
| 2:26:43| Are we including staff that have requested days off in the COVID metrics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8803)|
| 2:26:46| If a teacher is out of school because she has to take her son to an eye appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8806)|
| 2:26:49| will that force us to go to yellow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8809)|
| 2:26:51| I've spent time and effort trying to understand how these metrics work, and I have yet to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8811)|
| 2:26:55| find a clear answer after hours of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8815)|
| 2:26:58| It seems the metrics, as well, are left up to interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8818)|
| 2:27:02| So what's the purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8822)|
| 2:27:04| In the reopening plan last year, it was stated that when we reach green, the masks would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8824)|
| 2:27:07| be removed, normal in-school activities would commence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8827)|
| 2:27:10| Is it the board and superintendent's stance that because we don't have enough custodial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8830)|
| 2:27:14| staff hired, we're forced to stay in yellow status independent of COVID cases?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8834)|
| 2:27:19| Or is it, again, left up to interpretation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8839)|
| 2:27:22| I received an email this week stating that KCS has made a commitment to our parents of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8842)|
| 2:27:26| virtual students who return to school in January, that was a quote, as an answer to the reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8846)|
| 2:27:30| why I cannot attend my fifth grader's award ceremony or his field day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8850)|
| 2:27:34| There are 60,000 students in Knox County schools, and currently 50,000 of them are in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8854)|
| 2:27:40| Approximately 7,000 students of the in-person students return this January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8860)|
| 2:27:44| So why would the commitment made to 14% of in-person students override the commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8864)|
| 2:27:48| made to 86% of students that have been there all year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8868)|
| 2:27:53| What I'm asking the board for tonight is clear and overwhelmingly obvious guidelines that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8873)|
| 2:27:57| are understood by every single KCS board member, principal, staff member, teacher, parent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8877)|
| 2:28:03| anybody that wants to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8883)|
| 2:28:05| My pastor often says you can either make a point or make a difference, and rarely do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8885)|
| 2:28:08| you get to do both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8888)|
| 2:28:10| I'm not here tonight to make a point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8890)|
| 2:28:11| I'm here tonight to try to make a difference in our school system, and I believe that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8891)|
| 2:28:15| what each and every one of you really want, otherwise you wouldn't be sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8895)|
| 2:28:19| I want to thank the Knox County School Board, because without this interruption in my regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8899)|
| 2:28:23| routine, I would still be volunteering in classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| However, since this is not an option, I will now be spending my time fighting for the rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8905)|
| 2:28:30| of our students, not just mine, all KCS students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8910)|
| 2:28:33| I believe our students should have a right to protection by having a police presence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8913)|
| 2:28:36| in their schools, and not just the ones outside the city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8916)|
| 2:28:39| I believe our students and their parents should have a right to choose which medical devices| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8919)|
| 2:28:42| or interventions they deem necessary, including face coverings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8922)|
| 2:28:45| I believe our students should have clear policies that they and the whole county can clearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8925)|
| 2:28:48| understand, and I believe that face masks are just the beginning for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8928)|
| 2:28:51| I'm awake now, and I'm aware of our school system, and I will do everything in my power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8931)|
| 2:28:55| to work with you to make KCS the best it can be for our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8935)|
| 2:29:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8940)|

| 2:29:13| Thank you so much for having me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8953)|
| 2:29:15| Like others, I had one speech planned, and after listening to everyone downstairs, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8955)|
| 2:29:20| going to go a completely different direction, and I got to take a deep breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8960)|
| 2:29:27| Like many people, I'm here to ask to please end the masking immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8967)|
| 2:29:31| I sent you all an email explaining that good research is showing that children under 10| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8971)|
| 2:29:36| are extremely unlikely to contract or spread COVID due to not having enough ACE2 receptors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8976)|
| 2:29:43| and research is showing that COVID spike protein plugs into ACE2 receptors, and children do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8983)|
| 2:29:49| not have enough in the epithelial lining of the nasal passages to get it, much less spread| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8989)|
| 2:29:56| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8996)|
| 2:29:57| Dr. Childs had presented to you the one exception is morbidly obese children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=8997)|
| 2:30:01| That is because adipose tissue has ACE2 receptors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9001)|
| 2:30:05| With each decade of life, the ACE2 receptors in the epithelial tissue progressively increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9005)|
| 2:30:12| However, there's now been several studies that tracked the rare children who do contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9012)|
| 2:30:19| or test positive, and we know that many times a positive test can be a false positive, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9019)|
| 2:30:25| is also called asymptomatic positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9025)|
| 2:30:28| Those children do not spread to other people, therefore, masking does not make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9028)|
| 2:30:34| In adults, you now have access to the vaccine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9034)|

| 2:30:40| That said, I'm going to talk about all of the IEP issues and the special needs issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9040)|
| 2:30:46| I have a 21-year-old who was grossly failed by Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9046)|
| 2:30:52| She has autism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9052)|
| 2:30:53| She has vaccine-induced autism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9053)|
| 2:30:55| By the way, vaccine-injured lives matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9055)|
| 2:30:58| She quit school because she was bullied repeatedly by Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9058)|
| 2:31:03| She was told by faculty at Knox County schools, Allie can't do math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9063)|
| 2:31:08| Allie can't do math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9068)|
| 2:31:09| Guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9069)|
| 2:31:10| Allie's doing algebra, and Allie's doing geometry now at home, because guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9070)|
| 2:31:15| Lo and behold, Allie can do math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9075)|
| 2:31:17| I had to beg for a functional behavior assessment, because not every child gets a functional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9077)|
| 2:31:23| behavior assessment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9083)|
| 2:31:25| Only the parents that complain and raise Cain get functional behavior assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9085)|
| 2:31:31| Then when we parents get functional behavior assessments and we get functional behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9091)|
| 2:31:35| plans, it's hit or miss whether the functional behavior plans get followed, right, Sherry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9095)|
| 2:31:41| Howlett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9101)|
| 2:31:42| Then, if the functional behavior plans get followed, functional behavior plans do not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9102)|
| 2:31:47| get shared with people throughout the school, so if a child acts up with the lunch lady,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9107)|
| 2:31:54| the lunch lady has no idea what to do, because she has no idea that the functional behavior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9114)|
| 2:31:58| plan exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9118)|
| 2:32:00| So if you have an officer and you see a child with a problem behavior, chances are they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9120)|
| 2:32:04| have no idea a functional behavior plan exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9124)|
| 2:32:08| Now my anger and rage with my child's illness and what happened to her led me to go back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9128)|
| 2:32:14| to school to become a nurse practitioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9134)|
| 2:32:16| I am now a member of the Foundation for Children with Neuroimmune Disorders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9136)|
| 2:32:21| I am now the only practicing medical academy of pediatric special needs provider in training| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9141)|
| 2:32:26| in East Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9146)|
| 2:32:28| I receive a number of requests from Knox County Schools to sign orders for PTOT and speech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9148)|
| 2:32:33| language therapy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9153)|
| 2:32:35| I receive blank orders from Knox County Schools that says per the IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9155)|
| 2:32:40| I receive no IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9160)|
| 2:32:43| Well how do I know what I'm signing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9163)|
| 2:32:45| I have repeatedly asked Knox County Schools to please include the IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9165)|
| 2:32:50| I never get the IEP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9170)|
| 2:32:52| I will not sign those orders because I don't know what I'm signing for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9172)|
| 2:32:57| I have been told for years that Knox County Schools under identifies children with mild| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9177)|
| 2:33:04| behavior issues because you all don't want an audit from the Fed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9184)|
| 2:33:07| This is what I've been told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9187)|
| 2:33:09| Whether or not it's true, I do not know the answer, is that years ago the Fed said we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9189)|
| 2:33:14| have a certain percentage of children in this nation that have neurodevelopmental disorders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9194)|
| 2:33:21| Neurodevelopmental disorders over the last two decades have skyrocketed in the United| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9201)|
| 2:33:24| States and that percentage has never changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9204)|
| 2:33:28| And that if Knox County Schools over identifies students, the Fed will swoop in and do an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9208)|
| 2:33:32| audit and Knox County Schools does not want to do an audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9212)|
| 2:33:35| Again whether or not that's fact or fiction, I do not know the answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9215)|
| 2:33:39| But when I hear all of this talk about special needs students and functional behavior plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9219)|
| 2:33:44| it's crap because it doesn't happen in many schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9224)|
| 2:33:47| If you have a principal that's supportive of special needs kids, special needs kids| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9227)|
| 2:33:51| tend to get what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9231)|
| 2:33:52| If you have a principal that doesn't give a crap about special needs kids, special needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9232)|
| 2:33:56| kids are treated like crap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9236)|
| 2:33:57| Am I right, Sherry Howlett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9237)|
| 2:33:59| And to say that when children are bringing loaded guns to school we don't need police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9239)|
| 2:34:03| just seems crazy to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9243)|
| 2:34:05| If we had police guarding entrances of exits when I worked at Applebee's in 1994 and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9245)|
| 2:34:11| had alarms if people went out the fire exits, it seems to me that would have saved a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9251)|
| 2:34:15| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9255)|

| 2:35:27| A world where all humans are treated fairly would be nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9327)|
| 2:35:34| A world with less greed and more equality would alleviate so much needless pain and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9334)|
| 2:35:40| suffering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9340)|

| 2:36:35| attacked, especially by the stroke of a pen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9395)|

| 2:37:03| again because Knox County School Board continues to usurp authority that does not belong to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9423)|
| 2:37:09| them in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9429)|

| 2:37:25| You can be investigated for violating those regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9445)|

| 2:37:35| schools at risk of being prosecuted under the color of law because a member of government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9455)|
| 2:37:45| acting in official capacity cannot infringe upon the rights of citizens or they can be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9465)|

| 2:38:17| All the other counties are dropping their mandates fast, yet Knox County seems to want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9497)|
| 2:38:22| to prolong the suffering by not eliminating the mandate effective immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9502)|

| 2:43:35| We follow these mandates despite there being real questions as to whether the board ever| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9815)|
| 2:43:39| had the authority to impose them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9819)|

| 2:43:56| if the Tennessee Court of Appeals chose to review the parent's case he found real issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9836)|
| 2:44:01| of fact as to whether the school board exceeded its limited authority to impose such a mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9841)|
| 2:44:07| much less to impose punishment for violating the mandate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9847)|
| 2:44:10| The Court of Appeals did not hear that case but they will likely hear one soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9850)|

| 2:45:38| Eight and a half days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9938)|
| 2:45:40| And when I think about all of the time that has been spent repeatedly in an attempt to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9940)|
| 2:45:47| repeal a motion that was set back in September and all the things that we could be doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9947)|
| 2:45:54| with that time instead, I'm sad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9954)|
| 2:46:00| There are things that we need to be focusing on besides this and honestly no matter what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9960)|
| 2:46:09| anybody here's personal or political view is on masks, the Board of Education for Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9969)|
| 2:46:18| County set a policy back in September of 2020 and that policy said that the mask mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9978)|
| 2:46:29| would sunset in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9989)|
| 2:46:33| The reason that I believe that it's important and critical that you keep this simply has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=9993)|
| 2:46:41| to do with trust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10001)|
| 2:46:43| There are parents who made decisions for their children to attend school this summer based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10003)|
| 2:46:50| on that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10010)|
| 2:46:54| A lot of those parents are parents of medically fragile children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10014)|
| 2:47:01| The fact that it is too late now, if anybody here, let's say that Knox County decides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10021)|
| 2:47:08| to yeah, we're just going to let this sunset on the last day of school on the 25th of May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10028)|
| 2:47:16| it's still too late to send your kids to the summer program unless you had already signed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10036)|
| 2:47:21| up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10041)|
| 2:47:23| So really all that we're asking here is just for you to honor the policy that you set and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10043)|
| 2:47:32| looking back over the minutes even in September of 2020, I even have it down that Ms. Horne| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10052)|
| 2:47:40| actually said that she had heard from parents, teachers, and principals as well and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10060)|
| 2:47:45| most were positive about having a mask policy in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10065)|
| 2:47:51| She felt the policy needed to be clear about when a mask should be worn and when it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10071)|
| 2:47:56| permissible not to be worn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10076)|
| 2:47:59| So why is this on the agenda again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10079)|
| 2:48:03| You made a policy, we're almost finished, there's eight and a half days to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10083)|
| 2:48:11| I think about all the time that has been spent because almost every meeting this has come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10091)|
| 2:48:17| back up to repeal a policy that was set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10097)|
| 2:48:22| And I think about all the other things that could have been done and I actually had in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10102)|
| 2:48:28| my notes tonight, you know, discussing Mr. Watson and Ms. Satterfield's proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10108)|
| 2:48:35| All of the community input, all of that time that we could be using for that and that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10115)|
| 2:48:42| it's gone at least for this school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10122)|
| 2:48:45| I looked back over legislation that the state of Tennessee passed or discussed with regard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10125)|
| 2:48:54| to public schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10134)|
| 2:48:56| We didn't talk about that, I mean, and even just to give you a little bit, we had education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10136)|
| 2:49:02| we had training on the detection, intervention, prevention, and treatment of human trafficking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10142)|

| 2:49:31| on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10171)|
| 2:49:32| And all of this time has been spent hashing out and rehashing a policy that was decided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10172)|
| 2:49:40| Eight and a half days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10180)|
| 2:49:43| Hold what you said no matter what you think personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/school-board-264-210512?start=10183)|
