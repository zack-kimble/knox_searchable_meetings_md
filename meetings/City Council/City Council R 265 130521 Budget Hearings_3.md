| 4:27:15| Greenway to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16035)|
| 4:27:17| naval base on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16037)|
| 4:27:19| Alcoa Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16039)|
| 4:27:21| The Knox Blunt Greenway, which has been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16041)|
| 4:27:23| in the works for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16043)|
| 4:27:25| unfortunately, but we continue to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16045)|
| 4:27:27| some issues, but we're making baby steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16047)|
| 4:27:29| I guess I would defer to our engineering director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16049)|
| 4:27:31| because, really, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16051)|
| 4:27:33| Civil Engineering Division has really been taking the lead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16053)|
| 4:27:35| on doing the design and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16055)|
| 4:27:37| overseeing that bid process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16057)|
| 4:27:39| We're still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16059)|
| 4:27:41| trying to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16061)|
| 4:27:43| clearance from the CHPO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16063)|
| 4:27:45| and TVA on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16065)|
| 4:27:47| the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16067)|
| 4:27:49| design that we've revised a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16069)|
| 4:27:51| of times. There are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16071)|
| 4:27:53| high-value archaeological| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16073)|
| 4:27:55| resources out there that we have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16075)|
| 4:27:57| protect, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16077)|
| 4:27:59| we've been jumping through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16079)|
| 4:28:01| hoops trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16081)|
| 4:28:03| do something there that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16083)|
| 4:28:05| protects those resources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16085)|
| 4:28:07| appropriately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16087)|
| 4:28:09| We have a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16089)|
| 4:28:11| out there waiting to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16091)|
| 4:28:13| approved or denied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16093)|
| 4:28:15| We're hoping that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16095)|
| 4:28:17| this round will get approved, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16097)|
| 4:28:19| we're hoping that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16099)|
| 4:28:21| bid that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16101)|
| 4:28:23| hopefully this summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16103)|
| 4:28:25| We actually, at one point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16105)|
| 4:28:27| got to the point of bidding it, and then we got told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16107)|
| 4:28:29| that we couldn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16109)|
| 4:28:31| That was a year ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16111)|
| 4:28:35| On the bright side, when it is completed, it will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16115)|
| 4:28:37| over two miles of greenway along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16117)|
| 4:28:39| the south side of the river. It will be a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16119)|
| 4:28:41| scenic greenway. We just need to get it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16121)|
| 4:28:43| on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16123)|
| 4:28:47| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16127)|
| 4:28:49| Joe, any lessons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16129)|
| 4:28:51| learned from watching the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16131)|
| 4:28:53| outside bike groups| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16133)|
| 4:28:55| and stuff build that wilderness trail?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16135)|
| 4:28:57| In other words, they put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16137)|
| 4:28:59| some sweat equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16139)|
| 4:29:01| and a little bit of equipment to it and made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16141)|
| 4:29:03| a Forest Service dirt trail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16143)|
| 4:29:05| Is there anything we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16145)|
| 4:29:07| better as a city to build trails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16147)|
| 4:29:09| that way? Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16149)|
| 4:29:11| I want to thank Appalachian Mountain Bike Club| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16151)|
| 4:29:13| and all their volunteers for what they've been able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16153)|
| 4:29:15| They've built 20 or 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16155)|
| 4:29:17| miles of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16157)|
| 4:29:19| soft-surface,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16159)|
| 4:29:21| multi-use trails, mostly in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16161)|
| 4:29:23| South Knoxville, but we're also working with them right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16163)|
| 4:29:25| at Fort Dickerson Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16165)|
| 4:29:27| and also up at Sharps Ridge as they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16167)|
| 4:29:29| continuing to work to build more and more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16169)|
| 4:29:31| of these trails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16171)|
| 4:29:33| Obviously, as times get tough and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16173)|
| 4:29:35| finances become less available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16175)|
| 4:29:37| for greenway construction, rather than spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16177)|
| 4:29:39| $800,000 to build a mile of greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16179)|
| 4:29:41| we can take one-tenth of that and build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16181)|
| 4:29:43| ten times more mileage using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16183)|
| 4:29:45| volunteer resources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16185)|
| 4:29:47| But I think they've done a great job| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16187)|
| 4:29:49| and we want to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16189)|
| 4:29:51| that kind of partnership, but at some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16191)|
| 4:29:53| point, we're going to run out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16193)|
| 4:29:55| natural trail areas to build those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16195)|
| 4:29:57| kind of trails, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16197)|
| 4:29:59| we need to also balance that out with building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16199)|
| 4:30:01| ten-foot-wide asphalt trails that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16201)|
| 4:30:03| people have come to use and love.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16203)|
| 4:30:05| The flip side of the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16205)|
| 4:30:07| is, do we have some handle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16207)|
| 4:30:09| on the cost of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16209)|
| 4:30:11| and the time cycle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16211)|
| 4:30:13| for maintaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16213)|
| 4:30:15| the asphalt greenway trails? In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16215)|
| 4:30:17| what is it looking like we're experiencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16217)|
| 4:30:19| as they start to age?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16219)|
| 4:30:21| That's a good point, and as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16221)|
| 4:30:23| want to expand our greenway system, we also want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16223)|
| 4:30:25| take care of those trails that are currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16225)|
| 4:30:27| in place, and I know right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16227)|
| 4:30:29| we are, I think, tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16229)|
| 4:30:31| afternoon, we're going to be putting in the new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16231)|
| 4:30:33| bridge out there at Third Creek Bike Trail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16233)|
| 4:30:35| the one that kept on washing away every time we had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16235)|
| 4:30:37| a flood, so it'll be replaced with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16237)|
| 4:30:39| a new steel bridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16239)|
| 4:30:41| going to be put in place sometime tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16241)|
| 4:30:43| But we have $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16243)|
| 4:30:45| in our capital budget, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16245)|
| 4:30:47| being recommended for council approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16247)|
| 4:30:49| that will help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16249)|
| 4:30:51| ongoing maintenance and repair of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16251)|
| 4:30:53| asphalt, replacement of bridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16253)|
| 4:30:55| Is that in-house or contracted out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16255)|
| 4:30:57| That will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16257)|
| 4:30:59| a combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16259)|
| 4:31:01| David Grace, his crew do a great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16261)|
| 4:31:03| job helping us maintain the facilities, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16263)|
| 4:31:05| occasionally we'll have to work with engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16265)|
| 4:31:07| and the example of the bridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16267)|
| 4:31:09| we've contracted out the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16269)|
| 4:31:11| That's a little more sophisticated, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16271)|
| 4:31:13| repaving the surface, putting a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16273)|
| 4:31:15| two-inch top on it or something, is that something we do in-house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16275)|
| 4:31:17| We do, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16277)|
| 4:31:19| We do that also, and we also contract out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16279)|
| 4:31:21| I know David's crews, when they're not doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16281)|
| 4:31:23| streets and alleys, take time to help us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16283)|
| 4:31:25| repave existing greenways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16285)|
| 4:31:27| But an example, when we have actually contracted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16287)|
| 4:31:29| it at work out, we used the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16289)|
| 4:31:31| company that was doing the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16291)|
| 4:31:33| street paving last year to repave| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16293)|
| 4:31:35| Chartered Oil Park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16295)|
| 4:31:37| last summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16297)|
| 4:31:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16299)|
| 4:31:41| We need to probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16301)|
| 4:31:43| wrap this up with Mr. Walsh| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16303)|
| 4:31:45| and Mr. Reynolds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16305)|
| 4:31:47| for the sake of time here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16307)|
| 4:31:53| Page 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16313)|
| 4:31:57| Okay, I'm Tom Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16317)|
| 4:31:59| I'm Deputy Director of Building Inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16319)|
| 4:32:01| and Plans Review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16321)|
| 4:32:03| I'll go through this pretty quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16323)|
| 4:32:05| and just talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16325)|
| 4:32:07| my department a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16327)|
| 4:32:09| Our budget is pretty flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16329)|
| 4:32:11| Very little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16331)|
| 4:32:13| discretionary funds, and then what those discretionary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16333)|
| 4:32:15| funds are, are just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16335)|
| 4:32:17| things that keep our office going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16337)|
| 4:32:19| But the majority of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16339)|
| 4:32:21| budget is salaries and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16341)|
| 4:32:23| our fleet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16343)|
| 4:32:25| With that being said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16345)|
| 4:32:27| our funding level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16347)|
| 4:32:29| is right at $2.5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16349)|
| 4:32:31| It's always of interest to what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16351)|
| 4:32:33| we're one of the few departments that create| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16353)|
| 4:32:35| revenue for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16355)|
| 4:32:37| and I think revenue from our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16357)|
| 4:32:39| department is a reflection of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16359)|
| 4:32:41| especially the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16361)|
| 4:32:43| construction industry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16363)|
| 4:32:45| in the city of Knoxville, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16365)|
| 4:32:47| also a reflection of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16367)|
| 4:32:49| our economy. And, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16369)|
| 4:32:51| our revenue has gone down through the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16371)|
| 4:32:53| as our economy, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16373)|
| 4:32:55| our revenue went down probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16375)|
| 4:32:57| the lowest level around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16377)|
| 4:32:59| about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16379)|
| 4:33:01| 2008, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16381)|
| 4:33:03| And then it's recently been coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16383)|
| 4:33:05| During| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16385)|
| 4:33:07| 2010, it was back up to $1.4 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16387)|
| 4:33:09| about the same thing in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16389)|
| 4:33:11| Then in 2012, we've seen our biggest increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16391)|
| 4:33:13| in several years. It was $1.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16393)|
| 4:33:15| And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16395)|
| 4:33:17| we're, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16397)|
| 4:33:19| thank goodness, we're on track for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16399)|
| 4:33:21| to remain the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16401)|
| 4:33:23| We perform| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16403)|
| 4:33:25| right at, so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16405)|
| 4:33:27| during this same period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16407)|
| 4:33:29| of April of last year, we performed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16409)|
| 4:33:31| 38,000 inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16411)|
| 4:33:33| And this same period this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16413)|
| 4:33:35| we've performed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16415)|
| 4:33:37| 1,000 inspections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16417)|
| 4:33:39| So we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16419)|
| 4:33:41| up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16421)|
| 4:33:43| And some of that, I'll be perfectly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16423)|
| 4:33:45| fair with you, some of that is due to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16425)|
| 4:33:47| we've initiated a low-voltage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16427)|
| 4:33:49| permitting system, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16429)|
| 4:33:51| increased it a little bit, but we're also closing out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16431)|
| 4:33:53| a lot of open permits. So I see our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16433)|
| 4:33:55| inspections actually on the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16435)|
| 4:33:57| site being about the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16437)|
| 4:33:59| Our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16439)|
| 4:34:01| planned review and permit totals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16441)|
| 4:34:03| right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16443)|
| 4:34:05| are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16445)|
| 4:34:07| right at 9,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16447)|
| 4:34:09| 1,100 of those are actually planned review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16449)|
| 4:34:11| performed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16451)|
| 4:34:13| And then the rest of them are permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16453)|
| 4:34:15| We've had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16455)|
| 4:34:17| and sometimes we,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16457)|
| 4:34:19| this has been one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16459)|
| 4:34:21| busiest years I've had since I've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16461)|
| 4:34:23| at Bill and Inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16463)|
| 4:34:25| and Planned Review, from the standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16465)|
| 4:34:27| of function in our office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16467)|
| 4:34:29| and some of the challenges and accomplishments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16469)|
| 4:34:31| that we've had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16471)|
| 4:34:33| Since adoption of 2012 codes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16473)|
| 4:34:35| I think that's been a tremendously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16475)|
| 4:34:37| challenging process this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16477)|
| 4:34:39| because there's some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16479)|
| 4:34:41| pretty dramatic changes in 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16481)|
| 4:34:43| codes, especially from the energy side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16483)|
| 4:34:45| And we've also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16485)|
| 4:34:47| implemented a residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16487)|
| 4:34:49| planned review process started| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16489)|
| 4:34:51| May the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16491)|
| 4:34:53| And that, too, would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16493)|
| 4:34:55| on the 2012 codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16495)|
| 4:34:57| That's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16497)|
| 4:34:59| significant, I think, for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16499)|
| 4:35:01| in that, along with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16501)|
| 4:35:03| all these codes adoptions, we were dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16503)|
| 4:35:05| with the ISO ratings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16505)|
| 4:35:07| for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16507)|
| 4:35:09| And that really initiated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16509)|
| 4:35:11| our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16511)|
| 4:35:13| code adoption process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16513)|
| 4:35:15| because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16515)|
| 4:35:17| our ratings came back from ISO pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16517)|
| 4:35:19| dismal if we just stayed where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16519)|
| 4:35:21| we were at. I would be happy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16521)|
| 4:35:23| to report to council, and I know the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16523)|
| 4:35:25| mayor's already got notification of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16525)|
| 4:35:27| I hope I'm not bragging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16527)|
| 4:35:29| if I need to, but our ratings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16529)|
| 4:35:31| came back as a four, both for commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16531)|
| 4:35:33| and residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16533)|
| 4:35:35| which is very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16535)|
| 4:35:37| We get a big bang for our buck at four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16537)|
| 4:35:39| To get anything any better,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16539)|
| 4:35:41| it's just some things that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16541)|
| 4:35:43| would have to budget for, more training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16543)|
| 4:35:45| just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16545)|
| 4:35:47| unbelievable. We learned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16547)|
| 4:35:49| a lot about our ISO ratings this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16549)|
| 4:35:55| We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16555)|
| 4:35:57| really don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16557)|
| 4:35:59| anything other to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16559)|
| 4:36:01| for the sake of time. We've got some new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16561)|
| 4:36:03| requirements in our plan review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16563)|
| 4:36:05| process. Fires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16565)|
| 4:36:07| added| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16567)|
| 4:36:09| and is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16569)|
| 4:36:11| receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16571)|
| 4:36:13| an electronic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16573)|
| 4:36:15| copy of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16575)|
| 4:36:17| That's no big deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16577)|
| 4:36:19| I think most of our, a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16579)|
| 4:36:21| our plan review is going electronically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16581)|
| 4:36:27| We're also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16587)|
| 4:36:29| initiating a fee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16589)|
| 4:36:31| to be initiated at plan review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16591)|
| 4:36:33| and this has to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16593)|
| 4:36:35| engineering, and it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16595)|
| 4:36:37| a notice of coverage. This| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16597)|
| 4:36:39| has to do with them approving from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16599)|
| 4:36:41| state level the site preparation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16601)|
| 4:36:43| So we're going to start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16603)|
| 4:36:45| requiring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16605)|
| 4:36:47| that fee at plan review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16607)|
| 4:36:49| so that notice is being going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16609)|
| 4:36:51| Hopefully that will run pretty smooth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16611)|
| 4:36:53| Councilman Delvaux. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16613)|
| 4:36:55| Tom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16615)|
| 4:36:57| I guess some of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16617)|
| 4:36:59| new codes went into place in May,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16619)|
| 4:37:01| right? We adopted them effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16621)|
| 4:37:03| about six months out, and I was just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16623)|
| 4:37:05| curious, how are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16625)|
| 4:37:07| the engineers and the architects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16627)|
| 4:37:09| and the developers adapting to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16629)|
| 4:37:11| the new kinds of submissions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16631)|

| 4:37:15| So far it's went very smooth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16635)|
| 4:37:17| We had a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16637)|
| 4:37:19| excuse me, we had an influx, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16639)|
| 4:37:21| think, of permits to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16641)|
| 4:37:23| to, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16643)|
| 4:37:25| the reviews to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16645)|
| 4:37:27| yes, reviews to be submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16647)|
| 4:37:29| before they took effect, especially on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16649)|
| 4:37:31| the residential side. But,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16651)|
| 4:37:33| there was a few| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16653)|
| 4:37:35| submittals before the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16655)|
| 4:37:37| deadline that was requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16657)|
| 4:37:39| to be reviewed in 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16659)|
| 4:37:41| code. They went very smoothly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16661)|
| 4:37:43| And it'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16663)|
| 4:37:45| be a learning process. The industry is kind of growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16665)|
| 4:37:47| with the codes, and they're getting used to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16667)|
| 4:37:49| Pardon me? The industry is growing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16669)|
| 4:37:51| with the codes, getting used to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16671)|
| 4:37:53| complying under the new standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16673)|
| 4:37:55| Is that what you're seeing? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16675)|
| 4:37:57| And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16677)|
| 4:37:59| I mean, really what I've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16679)|
| 4:38:01| seen during the adoption process on the commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16681)|
| 4:38:03| side, there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16683)|
| 4:38:05| not a lot of discussion. It was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16685)|
| 4:38:11| some concern about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16691)|
| 4:38:13| But on the residential side, there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16693)|
| 4:38:15| a lot of discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16695)|
| 4:38:17| Because that market is very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16697)|
| 4:38:19| sensitive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16699)|
| 4:38:21| But,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16701)|
| 4:38:23| fortunately, in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16703)|
| 4:38:25| most of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16705)|
| 4:38:27| permits and our reviews are commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16707)|
| 4:38:29| Not a lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16709)|
| 4:38:31| of single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16711)|
| 4:38:33| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16713)|
| 4:38:35| we've seen a lot of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16715)|
| 4:38:37| we've seen more than other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16717)|
| 4:38:39| municipalities permitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16719)|
| 4:38:41| a multi-family, however.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16721)|
| 4:38:43| Apartment buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16723)|
| 4:38:45| and that type of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16725)|
| 4:38:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16728)|
| 4:38:50| All right. Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16730)|
| 4:38:52| Tom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16732)|
| 4:38:54| now that we've implemented, I assume,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16734)|
| 4:38:56| the same codes, city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16736)|
| 4:38:58| Yes, sir. Have we leveled the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16738)|
| 4:39:00| playing field, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16740)|
| 4:39:02| Are our inspections similar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16742)|
| 4:39:04| to theirs or vice versa so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16744)|
| 4:39:06| that the complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16746)|
| 4:39:08| or the concerns I've heard over the years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16748)|
| 4:39:10| about the difficulty of developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16750)|
| 4:39:12| in the city versus outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16752)|
| 4:39:14| the city are now equalized?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16754)|
| 4:39:16| I'm trying to figure out where we are with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16756)|
| 4:39:18| Well, I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16758)|
| 4:39:20| really and drearily we took care of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16760)|
| 4:39:22| when we adopted 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16762)|
| 4:39:24| International Building Code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16764)|
| 4:39:26| There was a concerted effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16766)|
| 4:39:28| And I heard this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16768)|
| 4:39:30| being chief building inspector for many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16770)|
| 4:39:32| the county did it this way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16772)|
| 4:39:34| or the county done it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16774)|
| 4:39:36| And Roy Braden would hear the same thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16776)|
| 4:39:38| in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16778)|
| 4:39:40| The city done it this way or the city done it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16780)|
| 4:39:42| I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16782)|
| 4:39:44| there was an effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16784)|
| 4:39:46| We also tried to include Farragut,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16786)|
| 4:39:48| but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16788)|
| 4:39:50| they sometimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16790)|
| 4:39:52| did and sometimes didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16792)|
| 4:39:54| I'll just say that. But anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16794)|
| 4:39:56| I think when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16796)|
| 4:39:58| we adopted the 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16798)|
| 4:40:00| as we did when we did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16800)|
| 4:40:02| the 2006, there was much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16802)|
| 4:40:04| collaboration between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16804)|
| 4:40:06| the two building officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16806)|
| 4:40:08| At that time, that was Gary Norman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16808)|
| 4:40:10| and Roy Braden. This time it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16810)|
| 4:40:12| myself and Roy Braden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16812)|
| 4:40:14| We actually scrutinized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16814)|
| 4:40:16| the amendments that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16816)|
| 4:40:18| made to the code so that we would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16818)|
| 4:40:20| adopting the very same code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16820)|
| 4:40:24| Our inspection process is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16824)|
| 4:40:26| a little different. We're a multidisciplinary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16826)|
| 4:40:28| inspection bureau, which means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16828)|
| 4:40:30| we have building inspectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16830)|
| 4:40:32| plumbing inspectors, mechanical inspectors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16832)|
| 4:40:34| and electrical inspectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16834)|
| 4:40:36| The county does not have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16836)|
| 4:40:38| The county does not have electrical inspectors at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16838)|
| 4:40:40| They have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16840)|
| 4:40:42| multidisciplinary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16842)|
| 4:40:44| inspectors. They have one inspector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16844)|
| 4:40:46| that goes out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16846)|
| 4:40:48| We're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16848)|
| 4:40:50| different in that aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16850)|
| 4:40:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16854)|
| 4:40:56| As you folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16856)|
| 4:40:58| know, I have personal knowledge, especially working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16858)|
| 4:41:00| with the city inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16860)|
| 4:41:02| and the codes. One thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16862)|
| 4:41:04| Tom, as you and I talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16864)|
| 4:41:06| is that I know you're going to have some key| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16866)|
| 4:41:08| personnel that are on track| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16868)|
| 4:41:10| to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16870)|
| 4:41:12| I just wanted to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16872)|
| 4:41:14| from the standpoint of how you're planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16874)|
| 4:41:16| ahead in terms of replacing those people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16876)|
| 4:41:18| you folks have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16878)|
| 4:41:20| to me, extremely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16880)|
| 4:41:22| service-oriented in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16882)|
| 4:41:24| helping with both the architects and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16884)|
| 4:41:26| contractors in terms of the building inspections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16886)|
| 4:41:28| and this sort of thing. I think you all do a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16888)|
| 4:41:30| great job on that. Can you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16890)|
| 4:41:32| speak to the fact that in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16892)|
| 4:41:34| couple of years you are going to see some of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16894)|
| 4:41:36| key older people leaving us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16896)|
| 4:41:40| Does it take two new ones to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16900)|
| 4:41:42| make one fella?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16902)|
| 4:41:44| Well, there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16904)|
| 4:41:46| the administration is very aware,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16906)|
| 4:41:48| and I've made the administration very aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16908)|
| 4:41:50| of what's going to happen in the next few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16910)|
| 4:41:52| in the building inspection department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16912)|
| 4:41:56| During this year, there's been some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16916)|
| 4:41:58| unforeseen things happen. Of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16918)|
| 4:42:00| Anita Cash left. That left a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16920)|
| 4:42:02| huge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16922)|
| 4:42:04| void, I think, in our department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16924)|
| 4:42:06| from the standpoint of just historical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16926)|
| 4:42:10| history, the history of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16930)|
| 4:42:12| what has went on in the department and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16932)|
| 4:42:14| actually what went on in the field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16934)|
| 4:42:16| and the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16936)|
| 4:42:18| involved in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16938)|
| 4:42:20| And then recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16940)|
| 4:42:22| we've had some sickness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16942)|
| 4:42:24| in the department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16944)|
| 4:42:26| and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16946)|
| 4:42:28| that left a void for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16948)|
| 4:42:30| a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16950)|
| 4:42:32| Scott Brownman is back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16952)|
| 4:42:34| He's a sign inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16954)|
| 4:42:36| There for a while we had about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16956)|
| 4:42:38| ten weeks where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16958)|
| 4:42:40| our zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16960)|
| 4:42:42| coordinator of many years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16962)|
| 4:42:44| was gone and our sign inspector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16964)|
| 4:42:46| for many years was gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16966)|
| 4:42:48| We have hired back a key person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16968)|
| 4:42:50| I think, in Scott Elder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16970)|
| 4:42:52| Scott is doing a tremendous job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16972)|
| 4:42:54| I brag on him all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16974)|
| 4:42:56| I hope that doesn't come back to bite me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16976)|
| 4:42:58| one of these days, but I don't think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16978)|
| 4:43:00| It's possible he comes from the sign industry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16980)|
| 4:43:02| which was a key for us when we hired him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16982)|
| 4:43:04| I don't think I realized at the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16984)|
| 4:43:06| we hired him that he had as much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16986)|
| 4:43:08| knowledge about the sign industry that he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16988)|
| 4:43:10| But that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16990)|
| 4:43:12| I know that council is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16992)|
| 4:43:14| dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16994)|
| 4:43:16| part of the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16996)|
| 4:43:18| that deals with signs. I know you're dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=16998)|
| 4:43:20| with that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17000)|
| 4:43:22| I think that's going to be a great hire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17002)|
| 4:43:26| And we're replacing him as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17006)|
| 4:43:28| can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17008)|
| 4:43:30| That was another thing. Two other things that I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17010)|
| 4:43:32| wanted to ask questions about. When was the last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17012)|
| 4:43:34| the permit fees were raised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17014)|
| 4:43:36| And like on signage also?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17016)|
| 4:43:38| Well, it's odd that you would ask that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17018)|
| 4:43:40| Chevelle Lewis, and I didn't recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17020)|
| 4:43:42| Chevelle. She's in the audience as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17022)|
| 4:43:44| as Robert Clark, our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17024)|
| 4:43:46| administrator. I like to call him our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17026)|
| 4:43:48| controller.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17028)|
| 4:43:50| But anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17030)|
| 4:43:52| it's been ten years since| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17032)|
| 4:43:54| our building inspection fees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17034)|
| 4:43:56| have been raised, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17036)|
| 4:43:58| our sign fees have never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17038)|
| 4:44:00| been raised that I know of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17040)|
| 4:44:02| That was my understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17042)|
| 4:44:04| So is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17044)|
| 4:44:06| something that I look into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17046)|
| 4:44:08| and look at a possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17048)|
| 4:44:10| of revenue there? That is something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17050)|
| 4:44:12| we're looking at, and we were going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17052)|
| 4:44:14| to initiate that just in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17054)|
| 4:44:16| few weeks, I think. All right. We're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17056)|
| 4:44:18| to have to break here. I want to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17058)|
| 4:44:20| a ten-minute break. It's five after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17060)|
| 4:44:22| Six after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17062)|
| 4:44:24| We'll be back at 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17064)|
| 4:44:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17076)|
| 4:44:38| Hi, Marshall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17078)|
| 4:44:40| Doing all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17080)|
| 4:44:58| Okay. Are we ready to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17098)|
| 4:45:00| resume here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17100)|
| 4:45:02| I'm going to ask that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17102)|
| 4:45:04| if we've got questions, let's keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17104)|
| 4:45:06| questions pertaining to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17106)|
| 4:45:08| the budget. We've kind of gotten| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17108)|
| 4:45:10| off on some sidebar things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17110)|
| 4:45:12| here, and consequently, we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17112)|
| 4:45:14| running way behind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17114)|
| 4:45:16| here. So ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17116)|
| 4:45:18| questions, but please, this is about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17118)|
| 4:45:20| budget, so let's try to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17120)|
| 4:45:22| keep it to that so we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17122)|
| 4:45:24| honor everyone's time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17124)|

| 4:45:40| Probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17140)|
| 4:45:42| the high points for engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17142)|
| 4:45:44| budget is the capital stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17144)|
| 4:45:46| which varies a whole lot from year to year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17146)|
| 4:45:48| This year, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17148)|
| 4:45:50| added $150,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17150)|
| 4:45:52| to new sidewalk construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17152)|

| 4:46:00| road construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17160)|
| 4:46:02| for that project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17162)|
| 4:46:04| that's been in the works| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17164)|
| 4:46:06| for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17166)|
| 4:46:08| We have $500,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17168)|

| 4:46:18| that we should be able to get that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17178)|
| 4:46:20| rolling this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17180)|
| 4:46:22| We have $200,000 for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17182)|

| 4:46:28| one was actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17188)|
| 4:46:30| unlike most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17190)|
| 4:46:32| intersection projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17192)|
| 4:46:34| this one was originated by request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17194)|
| 4:46:36| for making it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17196)|
| 4:46:38| more pedestrian friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17198)|
| 4:46:40| And once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17200)|
| 4:46:42| when we took a quick look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17202)|
| 4:46:44| at it, we realized that there would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17204)|
| 4:46:46| to be some major changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17206)|
| 4:46:48| and we thought, what the heck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17208)|
| 4:46:50| let's make it better for cars while we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17210)|
| 4:46:52| at it, which is sort of backwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17212)|
| 4:46:54| from the way we usually go with these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17214)|
| 4:46:56| We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17216)|
| 4:46:58| a small amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17218)|

| 4:47:14| substantial benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17234)|

| 4:48:28| Mr. Agerman. My main questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17308)|
| 4:48:30| about the Prosser Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17310)|
| 4:48:32| one is that the $1.2 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17312)|
| 4:48:34| how did we come to that number,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17314)|
| 4:48:36| and how assured are you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17316)|
| 4:48:38| or the city, that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17318)|
| 4:48:40| with that amount of money that it will solve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17320)|
| 4:48:42| that problem that's been with us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17322)|
| 4:48:44| for so long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17324)|
| 4:48:46| We came up with that because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17326)|
| 4:48:48| we've already done most of the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17328)|
| 4:48:50| work on it. We have a very good idea of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17330)|
| 4:48:52| we plan to do with it, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17332)|
| 4:48:54| a pretty good idea of how much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17334)|
| 4:48:56| it's going to cost. The design process isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17336)|
| 4:48:58| finished, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17338)|
| 4:49:00| I don't remember| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17340)|
| 4:49:02| when, I think it was a couple of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17342)|
| 4:49:04| there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17344)|
| 4:49:06| half a million dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17346)|
| 4:49:08| that went into the budget for the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17348)|
| 4:49:10| and research. We did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17350)|
| 4:49:12| DICE studies to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17352)|
| 4:49:14| look at how the underground system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17354)|
| 4:49:16| is connected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17356)|
| 4:49:18| and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17358)|
| 4:49:20| ended up being enough money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17360)|
| 4:49:22| to do the design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17362)|
| 4:49:24| I can't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17364)|
| 4:49:26| totally assured that it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17366)|
| 4:49:28| totally solve the problem, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17368)|
| 4:49:30| we can be very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17370)|
| 4:49:32| confident that it's going to reduce the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17372)|
| 4:49:34| severity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17374)|
| 4:49:36| both the duration and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17376)|
| 4:49:38| the frequency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17378)|
| 4:49:40| There| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17380)|
| 4:49:42| is a lot of study that's gone into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17382)|
| 4:49:44| it as far as where the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17384)|
| 4:49:46| goes, how high it goes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17386)|
| 4:49:48| how often it goes that high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17388)|
| 4:49:50| If we can get it above those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17390)|
| 4:49:52| statistically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17392)|
| 4:49:54| determined levels, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17394)|
| 4:49:56| it will be wet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17396)|
| 4:49:58| less often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17398)|
| 4:50:00| I think the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17400)|
| 4:50:02| know if we're going to spend this kind of money is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17402)|
| 4:50:04| going to have a pretty high expectation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17404)|
| 4:50:06| that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17406)|
| 4:50:08| is what we say is going to solve this problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17408)|
| 4:50:10| I think...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17410)|
| 4:50:12| We've taken| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17412)|
| 4:50:14| a long time to get here because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17414)|
| 4:50:16| we wanted to be assured that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17416)|
| 4:50:18| would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17418)|
| 4:50:20| We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17420)|
| 4:50:22| done all of the footwork, all of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17422)|
| 4:50:24| the background studies to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17424)|
| 4:50:26| be confident that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17426)|
| 4:50:28| we're going to get where we need to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17428)|

| 4:50:42| is that a full-time position or will that person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17442)|
| 4:50:44| be used for other engineering tasks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17444)|
| 4:50:46| In other words...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17446)|
| 4:50:48| It is a full-time position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17448)|
| 4:50:50| In order for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17450)|
| 4:50:52| that person to develop...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17452)|
| 4:50:54| It's sort of an entry-level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17454)|
| 4:50:56| engineering position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17456)|
| 4:50:58| For that individual to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17458)|
| 4:51:00| develop as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17460)|
| 4:51:02| fully-rounded traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17462)|
| 4:51:04| engineer, he or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17464)|
| 4:51:06| she will be expected to do some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17466)|
| 4:51:08| tasks and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17468)|
| 4:51:10| trained on a full range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17470)|
| 4:51:12| of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17472)|
| 4:51:14| engineering tasks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17474)|
| 4:51:16| But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17476)|
| 4:51:18| the focus will be on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17478)|
| 4:51:20| bike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17480)|
| 4:51:22| pedestrian,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17482)|
| 4:51:24| maybe some interactions with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17484)|
| 4:51:26| mass transit as necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17486)|
| 4:51:28| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17488)|
| 4:51:30| that will be the main focus, looking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17490)|
| 4:51:32| opportunities. And is that especially because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17492)|
| 4:51:34| of the number of regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17494)|
| 4:51:36| and oversight or what is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17496)|
| 4:51:38| Well, it's mostly because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17498)|
| 4:51:40| it's just not something we've focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17500)|
| 4:51:42| on in the past. And traditional engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17502)|
| 4:51:44| has been...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17504)|
| 4:51:46| Traditional engineering in the last 50 or 60 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17506)|
| 4:51:48| has been so focused on getting cars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17508)|
| 4:51:50| around that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17510)|
| 4:51:52| we haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17512)|
| 4:51:54| designed in many| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17514)|
| 4:51:56| options for anything but cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17516)|
| 4:51:58| And if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17518)|
| 4:52:00| start looking for opportunities to squeeze| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17520)|
| 4:52:02| some other modes in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17522)|
| 4:52:04| there...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17524)|
| 4:52:06| If we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17526)|
| 4:52:08| start looking for them, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17528)|
| 4:52:10| we're just not going to have those opportunities available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17530)|
| 4:52:12| And having somebody who is really focused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17532)|
| 4:52:14| on that... Someone's going to fly-spec the plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17534)|
| 4:52:16| and help you make them better by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17536)|
| 4:52:18| getting that... That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17538)|
| 4:52:20| A big opportunity that we're missing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17540)|
| 4:52:22| right now is somebody just going over the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17542)|
| 4:52:24| resurfacing plans and looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17544)|
| 4:52:26| for places where we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17546)|
| 4:52:28| got room to fit in a bike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17548)|
| 4:52:30| lane or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17550)|
| 4:52:32| look at this signalization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17552)|
| 4:52:34| and that sort of thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17554)|
| 4:52:36| that would... I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17556)|
| 4:52:38| some of that stuff doesn't cost anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17558)|
| 4:52:40| And...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17560)|
| 4:52:42| If you plan ahead, you're saying. If we plan ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17562)|
| 4:52:44| Got it. Thank you. Any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17564)|
| 4:52:46| questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17566)|
| 4:52:48| Yes, Mr. Hagman, if the budget is approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17568)|
| 4:52:50| and implemented, what... For us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17570)|
| 4:52:52| across the road, what kind of time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17572)|
| 4:52:54| are you looking at in terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17574)|
| 4:52:56| actually completing that if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17576)|
| 4:52:58| started?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17578)|
| 4:53:00| My recollection is that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17580)|
| 4:53:02| project will actually take six| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17582)|
| 4:53:04| months. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17584)|
| 4:53:06| we're planning to start in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17586)|
| 4:53:08| spring. Probably, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17588)|
| 4:53:10| guessing March. So, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17590)|
| 4:53:12| working in some place that floods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17592)|
| 4:53:14| routinely, you kind of want to wait until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17594)|
| 4:53:16| the time of the year where floods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17596)|
| 4:53:18| always happen is over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17598)|
| 4:53:20| So, it'll probably be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17600)|
| 4:53:22| next spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17602)|
| 4:53:24| And then it'll take about six months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17604)|
| 4:53:26| Thank you. So, hopefully within...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17606)|
| 4:53:28| Either within the next fiscal year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17608)|

| 4:55:04| But we do a whole lot more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17704)|

| 4:56:06| As far as our budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17766)|
| 4:56:08| this next year our proposed budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17768)|
| 4:56:10| is $36.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17770)|
| 4:56:12| This is an increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17772)|
| 4:56:14| of approximately $1 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17774)|
| 4:56:16| or 2.95%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17776)|
| 4:56:18| over our current budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17778)|
| 4:56:20| Salaries and benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17780)|
| 4:56:22| account for 69% of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17782)|
| 4:56:24| The remaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17784)|

| 4:56:38| actually on staff right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17798)|
| 4:56:40| I'd like to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17800)|
| 4:56:42| just a minute to talk about our capital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17802)|
| 4:56:44| requests and concentrate on those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17804)|
| 4:56:46| virtually or really all of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17806)|
| 4:56:48| or focus on their technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17808)|
| 4:56:50| improvements for the fire department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17810)|
| 4:56:52| The first one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17812)|
| 4:56:54| is really the second half of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17814)|
| 4:56:56| a capital project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17816)|
| 4:56:58| started last year and that's our fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17818)|
| 4:57:00| station alerting system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17820)|
| 4:57:02| We're requesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17822)|
| 4:57:04| $180,000 for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17824)|
| 4:57:06| Last year we were granted $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17826)|
| 4:57:08| and this will allow us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17828)|
| 4:57:10| fully implement a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17830)|
| 4:57:12| fire station alerting system, a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17832)|
| 4:57:14| fire station alerting system at all the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17834)|
| 4:57:16| stations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17836)|
| 4:57:18| Again, I talked about this last year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17838)|
| 4:57:20| but I'll just briefly remind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17840)|
| 4:57:22| you what this is about. This is what our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17842)|
| 4:57:24| 911 center uses to notify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17844)|
| 4:57:26| our firefighters at the fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17846)|
| 4:57:28| station that they're about to receive a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17848)|
| 4:57:30| run. It's basically a system of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17850)|
| 4:57:32| speakers and lights that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17852)|
| 4:57:34| come on and give the firefighters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17854)|
| 4:57:36| information about their run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17856)|
| 4:57:38| Our current system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17858)|
| 4:57:40| was first installed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17860)|
| 4:57:42| 1985. It was upgraded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17862)|
| 4:57:44| in 2002 and it's seen its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17864)|
| 4:57:46| useful life so it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17866)|
| 4:57:48| time to get it replaced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17868)|
| 4:57:52| Our second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17872)|
| 4:57:54| request is what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17874)|
| 4:57:56| we refer to as a CAD system upgrade| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17876)|
| 4:57:58| and it's for $359,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17878)|
| 4:58:02| What this is, the 911| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17882)|
| 4:58:04| center is currently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17884)|
| 4:58:06| has purchased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17886)|
| 4:58:08| a new computer aided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17888)|
| 4:58:10| dispatch or CAD system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17890)|
| 4:58:12| and we have started working on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17892)|
| 4:58:14| as far as the cabling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17894)|
| 4:58:16| and all that that goes with the 911| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17896)|
| 4:58:18| center. This new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17898)|

| 4:58:36| the same information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17916)|
| 4:58:38| that the ambulance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17918)|
| 4:58:40| has on their computers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17920)|
| 4:58:42| It's also going to have improved mapping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17922)|

| 4:58:58| requesting on this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17938)|
| 4:59:00| for us to be able to purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17940)|

| 4:59:12| There will be automatic location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17952)|

| 4:59:34| our plans for that and they've provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17974)|
| 4:59:36| a lot of the technical expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17976)|
| 4:59:38| that we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17978)|

| 4:59:46| Our last request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=17986)|

| 5:00:16| to be able to electronically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18016)|
| 5:00:18| store all that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18018)|
| 5:00:20| It is time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18020)|
| 5:00:22| for an upgrade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18022)|
| 5:00:24| The system that we have was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18024)|
| 5:00:26| initially started approximately 12| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18026)|
| 5:00:28| years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18028)|
| 5:00:30| IS is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18030)|
| 5:00:32| on board with this and it's going to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18032)|
| 5:00:34| things easier for them too. We'll basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18034)|
| 5:00:36| be going to a web based| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18036)|
| 5:00:38| information system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18038)|
| 5:00:40| and it's going to help them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18040)|
| 5:00:42| be able to manage it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18042)|
| 5:00:44| a lot better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18044)|
| 5:00:46| I think that's where I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18046)|
| 5:00:48| stop and take your questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18048)|
| 5:00:50| Questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18050)|
| 5:00:54| You said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18054)|
| 5:00:56| Chief that you had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18056)|
| 5:00:58| 327| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18058)|
| 5:01:00| guys but you only had 320| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18060)|
| 5:01:02| on staff. Are you going to train| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18062)|
| 5:01:04| the new ones or are you just staffing at the current level?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18064)|
| 5:01:06| What's the plan? We will train| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18066)|
| 5:01:08| new ones but it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18068)|
| 5:01:10| cost effective to train just seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18070)|
| 5:01:12| at a time. We normally don't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18072)|
| 5:01:14| consider it until we're down about 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18074)|
| 5:01:16| 15 is about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18076)|
| 5:01:18| minimal size. What's your turnover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18078)|
| 5:01:20| on an annual basis? We lose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18080)|
| 5:01:22| two or three per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18082)|
| 5:01:24| We do have some retiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18084)|
| 5:01:26| We have two or three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18086)|
| 5:01:28| that just move on to other jobs per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18088)|
| 5:01:30| And then we also have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18090)|
| 5:01:32| some retire. We have some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18092)|
| 5:01:34| retiring at the end of this year so we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18094)|
| 5:01:36| probably look at beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18096)|
| 5:01:38| the process sometime next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18098)|
| 5:01:40| But at seven, that's just not cost effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18100)|
| 5:01:42| to have ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18102)|
| 5:01:44| What's the per head cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18104)|
| 5:01:46| for training one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18106)|
| 5:01:48| It| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18108)|
| 5:01:50| depends greatly on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18110)|
| 5:01:52| the size of the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18112)|
| 5:01:54| So it's 15 to 20 or some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18114)|
| 5:01:56| optimal. We've estimated like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18116)|
| 5:01:58| 50 to 60 thousand dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18118)|
| 5:02:00| That doesn't really include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18120)|
| 5:02:02| like the overhead for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18122)|
| 5:02:04| training center, stuff like that. That's really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18124)|
| 5:02:06| just their salaries and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18126)|
| 5:02:08| the direct costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18128)|

| 5:08:58| be addressed, and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18538)|
| 5:09:00| obviously the mayor and I have talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18540)|
| 5:09:02| this, and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18542)|
| 5:09:04| realized that it was an aggressive ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18544)|
| 5:09:06| and I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18546)|
| 5:09:08| that with the funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18548)|
| 5:09:10| that come in, that we're limited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18550)|
| 5:09:12| and so, but I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18552)|
| 5:09:14| to make sure we put it on the radar that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18554)|
| 5:09:16| we do have a need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18556)|
| 5:09:18| as we go forward in policing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18558)|
| 5:09:20| our city to look at that possibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18560)|
| 5:09:22| of increasing our staffing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18562)|
| 5:09:24| so that as crime changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18564)|
| 5:09:26| as trends change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18566)|
| 5:09:28| as we try to adapt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18568)|
| 5:09:30| to address those things, that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18570)|
| 5:09:32| consider that. I did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18572)|
| 5:09:34| find the UC study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18574)|
| 5:09:36| the University of California Berkeley study, an interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18576)|
| 5:09:38| study. It talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18578)|
| 5:09:40| about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18580)|
| 5:09:42| most, as they called it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18582)|
| 5:09:44| under-policed cities, and we were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18584)|
| 5:09:46| ranked 27 in the under-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18586)|
| 5:09:48| policed cities, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18588)|
| 5:09:50| they talked about a lot of different factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18590)|
| 5:09:52| including economic factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18592)|
| 5:09:54| crime factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18594)|
| 5:09:56| and there were a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18596)|
| 5:10:00| things they looked at in that study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18600)|
| 5:10:02| Of course, we looked at that, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18602)|
| 5:10:04| we look at other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18604)|
| 5:10:06| things as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18606)|
| 5:10:08| Obviously, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18608)|
| 5:10:10| expressed our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18610)|
| 5:10:12| need as we look into the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18612)|
| 5:10:14| and I think it's an ongoing conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18614)|
| 5:10:16| that the mayor has agreed to have with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18616)|
| 5:10:18| In terms of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18618)|
| 5:10:20| technology and special| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18620)|
| 5:10:22| training, we have, at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18622)|
| 5:10:24| the special training, we have some good news| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18624)|
| 5:10:26| on that front. How does that make up, in part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18626)|
| 5:10:28| for sheer numbers? In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18628)|
| 5:10:30| how does that balance out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18630)|
| 5:10:32| the wish list versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18632)|
| 5:10:34| the skill list kind of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18634)|
| 5:10:36| We're very fortunate in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18636)|
| 5:10:38| our officers are very well trained, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18638)|
| 5:10:40| continue to be able to provide them training,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18640)|
| 5:10:42| and that does help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18642)|
| 5:10:44| and technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18644)|
| 5:10:46| obviously is a force multiplier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18646)|
| 5:10:48| and as we get more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18648)|
| 5:10:50| technology, obviously, there are things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18650)|
| 5:10:52| that we can do with that technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18652)|
| 5:10:54| that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18654)|
| 5:10:56| look at numbers, and one of them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18656)|
| 5:10:58| is this request to do online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18658)|
| 5:11:00| reporting. That's going to assist us as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18660)|
| 5:11:02| and so we constantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18662)|
| 5:11:04| look for the different ways that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18664)|
| 5:11:06| economically do the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18666)|
| 5:11:08| job that we have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18668)|
| 5:11:10| More efficiencies, you're saying. Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18670)|
| 5:11:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18672)|
| 5:11:14| Further questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18674)|
| 5:11:16| of the chief?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18676)|
| 5:11:18| I guess I should have asked. We have a training session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18678)|
| 5:11:20| this year or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18680)|
| 5:11:22| We're training new officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18682)|
| 5:11:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18684)|
| 5:11:26| As you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18686)|
| 5:11:28| approve, we will be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18688)|
| 5:11:30| to fill our vacancies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18690)|
| 5:11:32| Right now, we're at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18692)|
| 5:11:34| about 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18694)|
| 5:11:36| We anticipate we'll be at about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18696)|
| 5:11:38| 25 is our anticipation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18698)|
| 5:11:40| with retirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18700)|
| 5:11:42| and normal attrition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18702)|
| 5:11:44| and that academy wouldn't start| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18704)|
| 5:11:46| as we're looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18706)|
| 5:11:48| It wouldn't start until January of next year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18708)|
| 5:11:50| because of the process that it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18710)|
| 5:11:52| takes to do hiring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18712)|
| 5:11:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18714)|
| 5:11:56| No other lights?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18716)|
| 5:11:58| Thank you, chief. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18718)|
| 5:12:06| All right. We're to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18726)|
| 5:12:08| other agencies, beginning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18728)|

| 5:12:28| Move down here where I'm comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18748)|
| 5:12:30| You're out of position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18750)|
| 5:12:32| right? Just like church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18752)|
| 5:12:36| Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18756)|
| 5:12:38| Vice Mayor Pavelis and council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18758)|
| 5:12:40| for the opportunity to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18760)|
| 5:12:42| talk to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18762)|
| 5:12:44| For the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18764)|
| 5:12:46| fifth year in a row, we have requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18766)|
| 5:12:48| the same amount from the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18768)|
| 5:12:50| at $905,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18770)|
| 5:12:52| Those five years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18772)|
| 5:12:54| follow the high point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18774)|
| 5:12:56| in our funding from the city in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18776)|
| 5:12:58| 2009, which was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18778)|
| 5:13:00| $913,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18780)|
| 5:13:06| We have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18786)|
| 5:13:08| total operating budget of about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18788)|
| 5:13:10| 3.4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18790)|
| 5:13:12| million. We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18792)|
| 5:13:14| 36 full-time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18794)|
| 5:13:16| employees right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18796)|
| 5:13:18| We have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18798)|
| 5:13:20| two key positions that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18800)|
| 5:13:22| vacant that we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18802)|
| 5:13:24| fill. We needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18804)|
| 5:13:26| to fill them a year ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18806)|
| 5:13:28| when the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18808)|
| 5:13:30| cut our funding further| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18810)|
| 5:13:32| and were unable to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18812)|
| 5:13:34| The county has increased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18814)|
| 5:13:36| their funding to us this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18816)|
| 5:13:38| so far, adding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18818)|
| 5:13:40| to what they had reduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18820)|
| 5:13:42| it over the last several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18822)|
| 5:13:44| Our hopes are to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18824)|
| 5:13:48| fill the position in addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18828)|
| 5:13:50| and position in our GIS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18830)|
| 5:13:52| staff to get back to where we really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18832)|
| 5:13:54| need to be. We are down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18834)|
| 5:13:56| to a single person in addressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18836)|
| 5:13:58| that has experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18838)|
| 5:14:00| With our last ice storm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18840)|
| 5:14:02| of the season, she broke her leg| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18842)|
| 5:14:04| and literally was out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18844)|
| 5:14:06| of the office for two months and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18846)|
| 5:14:08| were piling up. We| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18848)|
| 5:14:10| all pitched in and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18850)|
| 5:14:12| helped as well as we could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=18852)|

| 5:29:36| at least proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19776)|
| 5:29:38| bond financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19778)|
| 5:29:40| What's the total cost of those three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19780)|
| 5:29:42| projects, the Tiger Forest, the Kids Cove| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19782)|
| 5:29:44| upgrade, and the ARC? In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19784)|
| 5:29:46| how much are we putting in, and how much is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19786)|
| 5:29:48| the total project? The city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19788)|
| 5:29:50| contribution would be nearly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19790)|
| 5:29:52| half of that. And how would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19792)|
| 5:29:54| you get the rest? That would be through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19794)|
| 5:29:56| fundraising and private contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19796)|
| 5:29:58| Okay, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19798)|
| 5:30:00| is there any way of estimating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19800)|
| 5:30:02| sort of the return on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19802)|
| 5:30:04| investment? In other words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19804)|
| 5:30:06| can you project more visits, or just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19806)|
| 5:30:08| being competitive? I mean, how do you look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19808)|
| 5:30:10| at that as a revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19810)|
| 5:30:12| generator? Well, we do anticipate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19812)|
| 5:30:14| that each of these new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19814)|
| 5:30:16| habitats will elevate guest experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19816)|
| 5:30:18| They'll make people stay longer, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19818)|
| 5:30:20| obviously when they stay longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19820)|
| 5:30:22| we'll spend more while they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19822)|
| 5:30:24| But also, it's able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19824)|
| 5:30:26| help people stop off the interstate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19826)|
| 5:30:28| We are a key attraction right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19828)|
| 5:30:30| on I-40, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19830)|
| 5:30:32| 128,000 guests come to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19832)|
| 5:30:34| the zoo from places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19834)|
| 5:30:36| outside 50 miles now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19836)|
| 5:30:38| So being able to increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19838)|
| 5:30:40| the value of the zoo and those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19840)|
| 5:30:42| experiences will increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19842)|
| 5:30:44| the number of attendants that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19844)|
| 5:30:46| And it also will prevent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19846)|
| 5:30:48| our facilities from just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19848)|
| 5:30:50| continuing to wear down and getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19850)|
| 5:30:52| less competitive and below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19852)|
| 5:30:54| the standards. What time frame| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19854)|
| 5:30:56| do you foresee building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19856)|
| 5:30:58| these over? Well, we've already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19858)|
| 5:31:00| begun demolition for Tiger Forest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19860)|
| 5:31:02| That has about a two-and-a-half-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19862)|
| 5:31:04| timeline. It's just crossing the lines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19864)|
| 5:31:06| right? Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19866)|
| 5:31:08| It's all gone now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19868)|
| 5:31:10| Green space as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19870)|
| 5:31:12| get started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19872)|
| 5:31:14| And then we anticipate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19874)|
| 5:31:16| the project timeline will run| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19876)|
| 5:31:18| begin this summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19878)|
| 5:31:20| and can run around five years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19880)|
| 5:31:22| five to seven years. The completion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19882)|
| 5:31:24| Yeah. So the tigers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19884)|
| 5:31:26| will be wherever they are now for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19886)|
| 5:31:28| the next five years? No, the Tiger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19888)|
| 5:31:30| facility itself would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19890)|
| 5:31:32| start this year. It has a two-and-a-half-year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19892)|
| 5:31:34| timeline. But for all three of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19894)|
| 5:31:36| projects. Oh, I see, all three. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19896)|
| 5:31:38| Well, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19898)|
| 5:31:40| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19900)|
| 5:31:42| Councilman Wallace?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19902)|
| 5:31:44| I'm a little bit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19904)|
| 5:31:46| confused on that timeline. So you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19906)|
| 5:31:48| asking for $10 million now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19908)|
| 5:31:50| and then how long will it take you to spend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19910)|
| 5:31:52| that $10 million? Well, that $10 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19912)|
| 5:31:54| would be allocated over the course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19914)|
| 5:31:56| of the next 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19916)|
| 5:31:58| And we would use that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19918)|
| 5:32:00| to leverage our private dollars in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19920)|
| 5:32:02| building. So it would start now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19922)|
| 5:32:04| and Tiger Forest, sorry, all of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19924)|
| 5:32:06| projects are scheduled for completion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19926)|
| 5:32:08| at around the five to seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19928)|
| 5:32:10| year timeline. So at that point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19930)|
| 5:32:12| we would be finished with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19932)|
| 5:32:14| the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19934)|
| 5:32:16| And how critical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19936)|
| 5:32:18| is it that you get $10 million right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19938)|
| 5:32:20| And how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19940)|
| 5:32:22| passionate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19942)|
| 5:32:24| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19944)|
| 5:32:26| having the $10 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19946)|
| 5:32:28| like I mentioned before, that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19948)|
| 5:32:30| be allocated every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19950)|
| 5:32:32| over time. And that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19952)|
| 5:32:34| is just a more fiscally responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19954)|
| 5:32:36| way for us to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19956)|
| 5:32:38| fund these projects instead of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19958)|
| 5:32:40| with loans. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19960)|
| 5:32:42| that will also then allow us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19962)|
| 5:32:44| to have the spending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19964)|
| 5:32:46| in place, make the changes quickly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19966)|
| 5:32:48| get the designs in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19968)|
| 5:32:50| process, and be able to complete| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19970)|
| 5:32:52| that timeline as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19972)|
| 5:32:54| project. Otherwise, the money wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19974)|
| 5:32:56| necessarily be in hand to meet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19976)|
| 5:32:58| that timeline. I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19978)|
| 5:33:00| there's a little confusion on it. Jim, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19980)|
| 5:33:02| you would address this. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19982)|
| 5:33:04| When we talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19984)|
| 5:33:06| doing a $10 million bond issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19986)|
| 5:33:08| and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19988)|
| 5:33:10| still looking at lots of ways to finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19990)|
| 5:33:12| it, we are probably not going to go to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19992)|
| 5:33:14| market and borrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19994)|
| 5:33:16| $31.4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19996)|
| 5:33:18| all at once. Because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=19998)|
| 5:33:20| we recognize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20000)|
| 5:33:22| that there is an extensive period of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20002)|
| 5:33:24| time to fund these projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20004)|
| 5:33:26| What we're asking for is authorization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20006)|
| 5:33:28| here. In terms of the actual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20008)|
| 5:33:30| financing that takes place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20010)|
| 5:33:32| and again, we're looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20012)|
| 5:33:34| at several ways. One of them is what we call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20014)|
| 5:33:36| a capital outlay note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20016)|
| 5:33:38| And I use that term because that's the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20018)|
| 5:33:40| legal definition. We commonly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20020)|
| 5:33:42| refer to that as a line of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20022)|
| 5:33:44| And one of those things would be sort of like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20024)|
| 5:33:46| a construction loan, where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20026)|
| 5:33:48| we enter into a line of credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20028)|
| 5:33:50| with some bank| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20030)|
| 5:33:52| and draw down on that line of credit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20032)|
| 5:33:54| as we need those funds. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20034)|
| 5:33:56| that's a way to save interest costs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20036)|
| 5:33:58| and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20038)|
| 5:34:00| We may do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20040)|
| 5:34:02| what we call a resolution of intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20042)|
| 5:34:04| where we can internally finance it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20044)|
| 5:34:06| and then we repay ourselves back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20046)|
| 5:34:08| with bonds. But again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20048)|
| 5:34:10| as we get closer and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20050)|
| 5:34:12| tie down some of those schedules, that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20052)|
| 5:34:14| when we'll come back with a specific financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20054)|
| 5:34:16| mechanism. But again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20056)|
| 5:34:18| we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20058)|
| 5:34:20| the $31.4 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20060)|
| 5:34:22| in debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20062)|
| 5:34:24| but the interim financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20064)|
| 5:34:26| is still yet to be determined. And that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20066)|
| 5:34:28| a long way off, and there's lots of steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20068)|
| 5:34:30| So don't expect that on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20070)|
| 5:34:32| July 1st we're going to come here with a $31.4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20072)|
| 5:34:34| million bond issue, because that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20074)|
| 5:34:36| not going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20076)|
| 5:34:38| You'll do that as you draw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20078)|
| 5:34:40| or need the money? Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20080)|
| 5:34:42| Well, again, we're looking at the best way to finance it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20082)|
| 5:34:44| But typically, you know, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20084)|
| 5:34:46| do a capital outlay note or a line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20086)|
| 5:34:48| of credit, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20088)|
| 5:34:50| if you were going out and building a new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20090)|
| 5:34:52| house, think of it the same| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20092)|
| 5:34:54| way. You go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20094)|
| 5:34:56| a bank and let's say you're building a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20096)|
| 5:34:58| $300,000 house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20098)|
| 5:35:00| you are probably not going to borrow $300,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20100)|
| 5:35:02| on day one because interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20102)|
| 5:35:04| will start accruing from that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20104)|
| 5:35:06| But you'll get the authorization. But you'll have the authorization| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20106)|
| 5:35:08| to borrow up to $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20108)|
| 5:35:10| You'll probably enter into some sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20110)|
| 5:35:12| line of credit agreement and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20112)|
| 5:35:14| draw down that as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20114)|
| 5:35:16| payments come due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20116)|
| 5:35:18| And that's where you can minimize the interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20118)|
| 5:35:20| Once you draw, you pay interest?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20120)|
| 5:35:22| You only start paying interest from the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20122)|
| 5:35:24| day you draw it. So, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20124)|
| 5:35:26| if it's three months into the thing before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20126)|
| 5:35:28| make the first draw, you don't pay any interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20128)|
| 5:35:30| you know, for the first three months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20130)|
| 5:35:32| But, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20132)|
| 5:35:34| the specific way we structure it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20134)|
| 5:35:36| still yet to be determined. But again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20136)|
| 5:35:38| when we talk about this $31.4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20138)|
| 5:35:40| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20140)|
| 5:35:42| that's kind of like the authorization and let us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20142)|
| 5:35:44| we'll come back to you with a specific| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20144)|
| 5:35:46| financing mechanism on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20146)|
| 5:35:48| How do you lock in low interest rates if you don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20148)|
| 5:35:50| sell the bonds right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20150)|
| 5:35:52| Well, again, what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20152)|
| 5:35:54| and again, there are a variety of ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20154)|
| 5:35:56| to do it. We talked about a line of credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20156)|
| 5:35:58| We talked about internal financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20158)|
| 5:36:00| We may go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20160)|
| 5:36:02| a bank that basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20162)|
| 5:36:04| will make a commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20164)|
| 5:36:06| that in, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20166)|
| 5:36:08| when we need the full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20168)|
| 5:36:10| $31.4 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20170)|
| 5:36:12| we'll basically have that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20172)|
| 5:36:14| agreement in place, but not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20174)|
| 5:36:16| draw on it for a set period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20176)|
| 5:36:18| Now, again, we're going to have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20178)|
| 5:36:20| evaluate all those structures to see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20180)|
| 5:36:22| which is the most financially advantageous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20182)|
| 5:36:24| for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20184)|
| 5:36:26| But in essence, you've got a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20186)|
| 5:36:28| five-year capital plan worth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20188)|
| 5:36:30| $31 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20190)|
| 5:36:32| that you're trying to get authorized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20192)|
| 5:36:34| and then you take pieces and you actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20194)|
| 5:36:36| We're going to take pieces of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20196)|
| 5:36:38| and there's some legal reasons why we're doing this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20198)|
| 5:36:42| And, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20202)|
| 5:36:44| something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20204)|
| 5:36:46| that only finance people care about, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20206)|
| 5:36:48| since these are tax| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20208)|
| 5:36:50| exempt bonds, we have to, we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20210)|
| 5:36:52| subject to what we call arbitrage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20212)|
| 5:36:54| restriction, meaning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20214)|
| 5:36:56| that we can't arbitrage it. Now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20216)|
| 5:36:58| if I could get positive arbitrage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20218)|
| 5:37:00| you ought to give me a huge raise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20220)|
| 5:37:02| because in this environment, nobody can get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20222)|
| 5:37:04| positive arbitrage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20224)|
| 5:37:06| But the computation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20226)|
| 5:37:08| that you have to go through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20228)|
| 5:37:10| to compute this for IRS purposes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20230)|
| 5:37:12| is very extensive, and so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20232)|
| 5:37:14| want to make sure that we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20234)|
| 5:37:16| time these expenditures so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20236)|
| 5:37:18| we don't have anything that we even have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20238)|
| 5:37:20| report, so for arbitrage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20240)|
| 5:37:22| purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20242)|
| 5:37:24| So it could be several years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20244)|
| 5:37:26| So it could be several years before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20246)|
| 5:37:28| I mean, it could be several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20248)|
| 5:37:30| before we fully engage at $31.4| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20250)|
| 5:37:32| but, you know, we may draw down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20252)|
| 5:37:34| you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20254)|
| 5:37:36| we may draw down, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20256)|
| 5:37:38| 2-3 million immediately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20258)|
| 5:37:40| You know, a lot of this is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20260)|
| 5:37:42| I think you're looking at probably a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20262)|
| 5:37:44| good year, year and a half construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20264)|
| 5:37:46| on the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20266)|
| 5:37:48| public works complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20268)|
| 5:37:50| Lakeshore, we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20270)|
| 5:37:52| They don't need it on day one. No, we are not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20272)|
| 5:37:54| again, on July 1st, we are not going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20274)|
| 5:37:56| have a $31.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20276)|
| 5:37:58| But by July 1st, do you have to declare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20278)|
| 5:38:00| what all the projects are going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20280)|
| 5:38:02| Well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20282)|
| 5:38:04| what you're doing as part of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20284)|
| 5:38:06| passing of this budget is you're expressing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20286)|
| 5:38:08| your intent. We may end up shuffling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20288)|
| 5:38:10| some of the stuff around to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20290)|
| 5:38:12| again, we're all in compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20292)|
| 5:38:14| for legal purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20294)|
| 5:38:16| But you're talking about intending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20296)|
| 5:38:18| to at some point in the next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20298)|
| 5:38:20| few years to issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20300)|
| 5:38:22| $31.4 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20302)|
| 5:38:24| For the projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20304)|
| 5:38:26| that we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20306)|
| 5:38:28| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20308)|
| 5:38:30| Part of what you're asking is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20310)|
| 5:38:32| we're going to approve these three different projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20312)|
| 5:38:34| and so two years from now, you're not going to transfer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20314)|
| 5:38:36| that money to some other project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20316)|
| 5:38:38| It's going to go to those three projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20318)|
| 5:38:40| As we put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20320)|
| 5:38:42| this process and we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20322)|
| 5:38:44| we'll probably have a very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20324)|
| 5:38:46| broad bond caption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20326)|
| 5:38:48| that says| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20328)|
| 5:38:50| public works and we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20330)|
| 5:38:52| kind of shy away from identifying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20332)|
| 5:38:54| specific projects and the reasons why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20334)|
| 5:38:56| we will do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20336)|
| 5:38:58| Again, to give us some flexibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20338)|
| 5:39:00| So if we need to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20340)|
| 5:39:02| shift some funds around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20342)|
| 5:39:04| then we'll have the ability to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20344)|
| 5:39:06| You don't want to get too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20346)|
| 5:39:08| specific when you do one of these bond deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20348)|
| 5:39:10| But you'll have to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20350)|
| 5:39:12| Yes, all bond deals have to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20352)|
| 5:39:14| to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20354)|
| 5:39:16| There's what we call an initial resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20356)|
| 5:39:18| period where we'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20358)|
| 5:39:20| come up with an initial resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20360)|
| 5:39:22| There's actually a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20362)|
| 5:39:24| time for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20364)|
| 5:39:26| what we call no process period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20366)|
| 5:39:28| We have to wait that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20368)|
| 5:39:30| I believe that's 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20370)|
| 5:39:32| in which case people have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20372)|
| 5:39:34| right to petition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20374)|
| 5:39:36| to contest that bond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20376)|
| 5:39:38| But there's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20378)|
| 5:39:40| mechanical steps just in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20380)|
| 5:39:42| borrowing money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20382)|
| 5:39:44| It's like you go down to your bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20384)|
| 5:39:46| You can't walk in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20386)|
| 5:39:48| and get that. There's lots of steps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20388)|
| 5:39:50| and all of those have to come back and be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20390)|
| 5:39:52| by council. These are all general obligation bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20392)|
| 5:39:54| We're talking general obligation bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20394)|
| 5:39:58| That was easy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20398)|
| 5:40:00| Sorry for the confusion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20400)|
| 5:40:02| but I think there's a lot of things going around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20402)|
| 5:40:04| that we're going to hit that on July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20404)|
| 5:40:06| So what they're asking for is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20406)|
| 5:40:08| for a commitment for $10 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20408)|
| 5:40:10| not necessarily paid out in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20410)|
| 5:40:12| one lump sum of $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20412)|
| 5:40:14| So it'll actually be paid out over a number of years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20414)|
| 5:40:16| That's correct. They're asking the commitment for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20416)|
| 5:40:18| But it's going to take us several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20418)|
| 5:40:20| to actually get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20420)|
| 5:40:22| the full 31| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20422)|
| 5:40:24| for what you've asked for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20424)|
| 5:40:26| How does that help the zoo leverage private giving?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20426)|
| 5:40:28| How does having the commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20428)|
| 5:40:30| help you leverage it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20430)|
| 5:40:32| Because it shows that the city's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20432)|
| 5:40:34| invested in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20434)|
| 5:40:36| Knoxville Zoo and then it allows us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20436)|
| 5:40:38| to say in our fundraising efforts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20438)|
| 5:40:40| that we have half of this project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20440)|
| 5:40:42| funded. So it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20442)|
| 5:40:44| giving to a program that already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20444)|
| 5:40:46| has municipal support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20446)|
| 5:40:48| Does any draw| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20448)|
| 5:40:50| have to have a matching private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20450)|
| 5:40:52| dollar to go out the door?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20452)|
| 5:40:54| Or how does that work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20454)|
| 5:40:56| Well, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20456)|
| 5:40:58| I don't think that's the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20458)|
| 5:41:00| of this but, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20460)|
| 5:41:02| it depends on how we structure an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20462)|
| 5:41:04| if we have an agreement in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20464)|
| 5:41:06| But that was not the intent that we have to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20466)|
| 5:41:08| a dollar for dollar match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20468)|
| 5:41:10| or some sort of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20470)|
| 5:41:12| you know, I'm sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20472)|
| 5:41:14| they're not going to. That's the hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20474)|
| 5:41:16| I'm sure that the zoo is not going to go out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20476)|
| 5:41:18| and start, you know, building these things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20478)|
| 5:41:20| without making sure they have funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20480)|
| 5:41:22| in place either, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20482)|
| 5:41:24| I recognize Tim Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20484)|
| 5:41:26| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20486)|
| 5:41:28| Tim Williams, who's the zoo board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20488)|
| 5:41:30| Just a comment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20490)|
| 5:41:32| on that, Mr. DellaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20492)|
| 5:41:34| We have, for the Tiger exhibit, we have a million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20494)|
| 5:41:36| dollars in private funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20496)|
| 5:41:38| arranged and so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20498)|
| 5:41:40| broke ground on that exhibit with that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20500)|
| 5:41:42| arrangement. The alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20502)|
| 5:41:44| to the city funding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20504)|
| 5:41:46| would have been debt at a much higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20506)|
| 5:41:48| cost fund than the bond issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20508)|
| 5:41:50| is going to result. Because we have a municipal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20510)|
| 5:41:52| bond rating that gets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20512)|
| 5:41:54| the buyer of the bond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20514)|
| 5:41:56| some tax-free vinnies, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20516)|
| 5:41:58| Some yield. Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20518)|
| 5:42:00| So when we talk about the other two major projects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20520)|
| 5:42:02| when we talk about the ARCC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20522)|
| 5:42:04| project, we don't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20524)|
| 5:42:06| for certain the size of that project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20526)|
| 5:42:08| It will largely depend on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20528)|
| 5:42:10| the amount of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20530)|
| 5:42:12| private dollars we can attract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20532)|
| 5:42:14| for that project. We don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20534)|
| 5:42:16| a commitment on it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20536)|
| 5:42:18| We've not gone out to the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20538)|
| 5:42:20| to ask for that commitment yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20540)|
| 5:42:22| But we'll be doing that as we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20542)|
| 5:42:24| get closer to the time we want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20544)|
| 5:42:26| start drafting plans for that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20546)|
| 5:42:28| exhibit. But do you feel that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20548)|
| 5:42:30| helps you leverage the private dollar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20550)|
| 5:42:32| It absolutely does. And it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20552)|
| 5:42:34| gives us some sense of the scale that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20554)|
| 5:42:36| can build to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20556)|
| 5:42:38| Without having the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20558)|
| 5:42:40| city's commitment, it would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20560)|
| 5:42:42| very difficult to build the exhibit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20562)|
| 5:42:44| of the quality that we need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20564)|
| 5:42:46| to build. We've got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20566)|
| 5:42:48| a tremendous amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20568)|
| 5:42:50| of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20570)|
| 5:42:52| species to show. What are they called?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20572)|
| 5:42:54| Snakes and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20574)|
| 5:42:56| lizards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20576)|
| 5:42:58| You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20578)|
| 5:43:00| it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20580)|
| 5:43:02| really a great exhibit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20582)|
| 5:43:04| We just don't have a way to show it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20584)|
| 5:43:06| And so raising the money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20586)|
| 5:43:08| getting part of it from the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20588)|
| 5:43:10| part of it from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20590)|
| 5:43:12| is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20592)|
| 5:43:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20594)|
| 5:43:16| All right. Any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20596)|
| 5:43:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20598)|

| 5:43:46| Thank you, Council Members, for this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20626)|
| 5:43:48| to talk to you briefly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20628)|
| 5:43:50| about the Community Action| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20630)|
| 5:43:52| Committee and the work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20632)|
| 5:43:54| that we do and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20634)|
| 5:43:56| important partnership that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20636)|
| 5:43:58| we have with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20638)|
| 5:44:00| to help us accomplish these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20640)|
| 5:44:02| Our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20642)|

| 5:44:08| and we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20648)|

| 5:46:06| local contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20766)|

| 5:46:44| of the volunteer time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20804)|
| 5:46:46| that was marshaled in this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20806)|
| 5:46:48| report period with over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20808)|

| 5:49:16| a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20956)|
| 5:49:18| I think what you just said was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20958)|
| 5:49:20| to that 615| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20960)|
| 5:49:22| we would add the 125 or get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20962)|
| 5:49:24| to 740 to cover| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20964)|
| 5:49:26| the services, but in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20966)|
| 5:49:28| terms of budgetary management, part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20968)|
| 5:49:30| of that's going under a different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20970)|
| 5:49:32| group, the community services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20972)|
| 5:49:34| That's my understanding, yes. And I know your guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20974)|
| 5:49:36| haven't had a raise in a long time and so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20976)|
| 5:49:38| it's long overdue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20978)|
| 5:49:40| That's true as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=20980)|

| 5:50:06| about things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21006)|
| 5:50:08| that PBA does for us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21008)|
| 5:50:10| because it actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21010)|
| 5:50:12| shows up in multiple places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21012)|
| 5:50:14| in our budget and there's no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21014)|
| 5:50:16| you won't be able to find something that says PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21016)|
| 5:50:20| And I'll give you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21020)|
| 5:50:22| some page numbers if you want to refer to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21022)|
| 5:50:24| One of them is what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21024)|

| 5:50:32| cinema, the one that's across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21032)|

| 5:51:04| things as well. That's page 89.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21064)|
| 5:51:06| And of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21066)|
| 5:51:08| course the City| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21068)|

| 5:51:12| actually found on page 112| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21072)|
| 5:51:14| of the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21074)|
| 5:51:16| In addition to that there are several other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21076)|
| 5:51:18| things that they do for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21078)|
| 5:51:20| One, it's a little tiny item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21080)|
| 5:51:22| but that's, they manage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21082)|
| 5:51:24| some of the security, I'm going to call them security| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21084)|
| 5:51:26| badges if you use your badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21086)|
| 5:51:28| Police Department has the same kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21088)|
| 5:51:30| arrangement for their facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21090)|
| 5:51:32| and PBA kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21092)|
| 5:51:34| manages that portion of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21094)|
| 5:51:36| They also do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21096)|
| 5:51:38| facility management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21098)|

| 5:51:48| Crutcher facility, I think is what that's called.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21108)|
| 5:51:50| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21110)|
| 5:51:52| as you well know, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21112)|
| 5:51:54| occasionally bring various things up through this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21114)|
| 5:51:56| and that's for project management on a variety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21116)|
| 5:51:58| of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21118)|
| 5:52:00| So again, PBA flows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21120)|
| 5:52:02| throughout this budget and we use them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21122)|
| 5:52:04| kind of as a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21124)|
| 5:52:06| facility manager, project manager| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21126)|
| 5:52:08| of that sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21128)|
| 5:52:10| I'll address any specific questions you might have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21130)|
| 5:52:12| but again, perhaps Dale's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21132)|
| 5:52:14| better off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21134)|
| 5:52:16| Mr. Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21136)|
| 5:52:18| Good afternoon, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21138)|
| 5:52:20| First I wanted to introduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21140)|
| 5:52:22| the two folks to my right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21142)|
| 5:52:24| to my far right, Robin Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21144)|
| 5:52:26| No relation, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21146)|
| 5:52:28| is our finance director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21148)|
| 5:52:30| And to my immediate right, Jeff Gallion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21150)|
| 5:52:32| who is our property development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21152)|
| 5:52:34| manager as well as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21154)|
| 5:52:36| our telecommunications system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21156)|
| 5:52:38| The only| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21158)|
| 5:52:40| thing Jim left off was that we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21160)|
| 5:52:42| manage the cities, the counties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21162)|
| 5:52:44| and the school boards, the school districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21164)|
| 5:52:46| telephone systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21166)|
| 5:52:48| the hard line systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21168)|
| 5:52:50| I'll also make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21170)|
| 5:52:52| an offer for any of you that are interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21172)|
| 5:52:54| Just call me, email me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21174)|
| 5:52:56| or ask Jim to and that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21176)|
| 5:52:58| we put together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21178)|
| 5:53:00| a budget and then Jim carves it up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21180)|
| 5:53:02| and spreads it throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21182)|
| 5:53:04| the city's budget appropriately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21184)|
| 5:53:06| but in one sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21186)|
| 5:53:08| that's sitting in front of me, you can see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21188)|
| 5:53:10| everything we do for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21190)|
| 5:53:12| in fairly simple, straightforward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21192)|
| 5:53:14| terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21194)|
| 5:53:16| I happen to have a copy that we could...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21196)|
| 5:53:18| I don't but I could email you one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21198)|
| 5:53:20| tomorrow morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21200)|
| 5:53:22| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21202)|
| 5:53:24| That would be good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21204)|
| 5:53:26| To summarize our budget...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21206)|
| 5:53:28| Could you do that? I mean we would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21208)|
| 5:53:30| I think that would be a great thing for us to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21210)|
| 5:53:32| Sure. I'll send you this sheet that shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21212)|
| 5:53:34| the consolidated and there's layers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21214)|

| 5:53:38| glad to send any of that if you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21218)|
| 5:53:40| any questions about any portion of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21220)|
| 5:53:42| that budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21222)|
| 5:53:44| It's easier to get your arms around it than to see it in one place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21224)|
| 5:53:46| It sure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21226)|
| 5:53:48| I wouldn't want to have to find it in your budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21228)|
| 5:53:50| or the county's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21230)|
| 5:53:52| That's why I made that offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21232)|
| 5:53:54| Mr. Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21234)|
| 5:53:56| if you were to send it to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21236)|
| 5:53:58| Ms. Mitchell and then she can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21238)|
| 5:54:00| distribute it to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21240)|
| 5:54:02| I sure will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21242)|
| 5:54:04| Our budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21244)|
| 5:54:06| proposal this year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21246)|

| 5:54:12| increase and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21252)|

| 5:54:16| total budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21256)|
| 5:54:18| Over half of that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21258)|
| 5:54:20| is that we recommended mirroring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21260)|
| 5:54:22| the county's 2%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21262)|
| 5:54:24| wage increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21264)|
| 5:54:26| We generally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21266)|
| 5:54:28| mirror the cheaper of the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21268)|
| 5:54:30| or the county's wage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21270)|
| 5:54:32| increases and almost always the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21272)|
| 5:54:34| cheaper is the county's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21274)|
| 5:54:36| So we have a 2% salary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21276)|
| 5:54:38| increase built in and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21278)|
| 5:54:40| represents, as I said, a little over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21280)|
| 5:54:42| half of that $200,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21282)|
| 5:54:44| number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21284)|
| 5:54:46| A couple of things that I wanted to comment on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21286)|
| 5:54:48| First, I wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21288)|
| 5:54:50| to sincerely compliment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21290)|
| 5:54:52| Mr. Maness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21292)|
| 5:54:54| It's been a pleasure for us to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21294)|
| 5:54:56| to know Eddie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21296)|
| 5:54:58| and Eddie's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21298)|
| 5:55:00| consumer business background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21300)|
| 5:55:02| causes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21302)|
| 5:55:04| him to be very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21304)|
| 5:55:06| focused on, quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21306)|
| 5:55:08| in his terms, the customer experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21308)|
| 5:55:10| And I mean| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21310)|
| 5:55:12| that is where we're concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21312)|
| 5:55:14| in relationship to experience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21314)|
| 5:55:16| was in the parking garages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21316)|
| 5:55:18| experiences at Walls Fair Park, etc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21318)|
| 5:55:20| And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21320)|
| 5:55:22| Eddie has been great to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21322)|
| 5:55:24| I'm sorry to see him leaving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21324)|
| 5:55:26| and we've benefited| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21326)|
| 5:55:28| greatly from him working| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21328)|
| 5:55:30| with us and challenging us to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21330)|
| 5:55:32| those experiences better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21332)|
| 5:55:34| Having said that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21334)|
| 5:55:36| I will tell you that we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21336)|
| 5:55:38| painfully aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21338)|
| 5:55:40| of some problems in the parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21340)|
| 5:55:42| garages, particularly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21342)|
| 5:55:44| kind of being a victim| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21344)|
| 5:55:46| of our own collective success| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21346)|
| 5:55:48| with the amount of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21348)|
| 5:55:50| coming downtown on nights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21350)|
| 5:55:52| and on weekends when the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21352)|
| 5:55:54| garages are not manned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21354)|
| 5:55:56| We have some flaws| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21356)|
| 5:55:58| in our computer systems and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21358)|
| 5:56:00| technology that we are very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21360)|
| 5:56:02| aggressively trying to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21362)|
| 5:56:04| shop and fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21364)|
| 5:56:06| In fact, my property management| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21366)|
| 5:56:08| director, Jane Burrett, is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21368)|
| 5:56:10| at a national parking conference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21370)|
| 5:56:12| as we speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21372)|
| 5:56:14| doing exactly that, looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21374)|
| 5:56:16| the kinds of technologies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21376)|
| 5:56:18| that will be both cost effective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21378)|
| 5:56:20| but will also improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21380)|
| 5:56:22| the customer experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21382)|
| 5:56:24| An example, something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21384)|
| 5:56:26| that Councilman Saunders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21386)|
| 5:56:28| and I were talking about yesterday is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21388)|
| 5:56:30| our current systems only count| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21390)|
| 5:56:32| vehicles if we have the gates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21392)|
| 5:56:34| down. Well, putting the gates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21394)|
| 5:56:36| down on nights and weekends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21396)|
| 5:56:38| is kind of counterintuitive and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21398)|
| 5:56:40| counterproductive for easy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21400)|
| 5:56:42| flows of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21402)|
| 5:56:44| But what that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21404)|
| 5:56:46| also means is that you can drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21406)|
| 5:56:48| into a garage that's full without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21408)|
| 5:56:50| knowing it until you get to the top,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21410)|
| 5:56:52| which is really annoying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21412)|
| 5:56:54| We know that there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21414)|
| 5:56:56| technologies to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21416)|
| 5:56:58| In fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21418)|
| 5:57:00| we've been in discussions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21420)|
| 5:57:02| that are not conclusive about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21422)|
| 5:57:04| extending some of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21424)|
| 5:57:06| matters to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21426)|
| 5:57:08| your own street parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21428)|
| 5:57:10| potentially, and that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21430)|
| 5:57:12| an area that no decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21432)|
| 5:57:14| have been ultimately made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21434)|
| 5:57:16| But there is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21436)|
| 5:57:18| logic in managing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21438)|
| 5:57:20| all of your parking assets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21440)|
| 5:57:22| both your own street and your garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21442)|
| 5:57:24| assets, and making sure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21444)|
| 5:57:26| for instance, people that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21446)|
| 5:57:28| trying to park downtown all day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21448)|
| 5:57:30| we should try to migrate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21450)|
| 5:57:32| them into the garages where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21452)|
| 5:57:34| we can accommodate all-day parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21454)|
| 5:57:36| and let our on-street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21456)|
| 5:57:38| parking be more available for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21458)|
| 5:57:40| those people that are transients| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21460)|
| 5:57:42| that are coming in to have lunch, that are coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21462)|
| 5:57:44| in to shop for an hour or two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21464)|
| 5:57:46| and leave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21466)|
| 5:57:48| We're putting a lot of effort into that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21468)|
| 5:57:50| and I just wanted to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21470)|
| 5:57:52| you're aware of it because you haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21472)|
| 5:57:54| seen many changes yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21474)|
| 5:57:56| but I think you will see those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21476)|
| 5:57:58| over the next three to six months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21478)|
| 5:58:00| some significant improvement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21480)|
| 5:58:02| in how the garages| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21482)|
| 5:58:04| certainly function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21484)|
| 5:58:06| And depending on the city's decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21486)|
| 5:58:08| potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21488)|
| 5:58:10| improvements on the on-street side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21490)|
| 5:58:12| I'm going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21492)|
| 5:58:14| stop with that and just take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21494)|
| 5:58:16| questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21496)|
| 5:58:18| Councilman DelVopo, he has a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21498)|
| 5:58:20| Thank you. It's unusual, but I have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21500)|
| 5:58:24| I can picture where you have like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130521budgethearings?start=21504)|
