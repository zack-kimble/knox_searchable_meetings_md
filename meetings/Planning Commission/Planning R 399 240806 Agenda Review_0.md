| 0:03:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=226)|

| 0:04:14| project details, and then the relevant zoning standards and the guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=254)|

| 0:05:00| It is nine to four stories of residential apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| It's above five stories of structured parking on the rear massing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| The building is proposed for an L-shaped site, so you can see that here, at the intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=307)|
| 0:05:13| of West Hill Avenue, Locust Street, and Front Avenue, and it's located immediately north| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=313)|
| 0:05:18| of Neyland Drive and the river.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=318)|
| 0:05:20| The site is significantly sloped towards the south and the river, and the building will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| be L-shaped, responding to that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=323)|

| 0:05:29| You can see that on the left here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=329)|

| 0:05:37| Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=337)|

| 0:05:44| and my cursor is calling it out, that's zoned DKG, which is the grid subdistrict, and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=344)|
| 0:05:49| the remaining parcels are zoned DKB, the boulevard subdistrict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=349)|
| 0:05:54| I'll just discuss those further, but those are two different subdistricts in the downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=354)|

| 0:06:12| here, there is a central section clad in metal panels, and then you can see the larger massing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=372)|
| 0:06:18| that fronts the river on the left here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=378)|

| 0:06:58| so we try to identify in advance zoning or building code issues that might occur during| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| permitting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=423)|

| 0:07:18| The proposed project meets all of the dimensional and design standards in the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=438)|
| 0:07:23| It does not require any sort of variances, whether from the DRB or the Board of Zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=443)|
| 0:07:27| Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=447)|

| 0:07:34| For any buildings that are over 85 feet in height, they are required to provide a step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| back from that street level above the third story and below the seventh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=460)|

| 0:09:06| They then move to the private realm and focus on the buildings themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=546)|
| 0:09:10| The emphasis throughout the design guidelines is how the buildings reinforce the pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=550)|
| 0:09:15| activity and relate to the pedestrian at the ground level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=555)|
| 0:09:19| It also emphasizes that new buildings should relate to the others in the context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=559)|
| 0:09:24| We look at the block, the sub-district, and then downtown as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=564)|
| 0:09:28| Finally, getting even more narrow, there are design guidelines related to architectural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=568)|
| 0:09:33| elements, ground floor windows and doors, and then there are some design guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=573)|
| 0:09:37| that are related to these sub-districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| I've put on the screen here the boulevard sub-district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=580)|
| 0:09:44| Those are in there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=584)|
| 0:09:47| The design review board, just in summary, they're charged with interpreting quite a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=587)|
| 0:09:49| lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=589)|
| 0:09:51| They interpret the design guidelines and they apply those to specific sites and projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| based on that staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=596)|
| 0:09:58| I'm available to answer questions on the design review board application and review process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=598)|
| 0:10:04| the project itself, we have the DRB's purview, and then the DK zoning code and the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=604)|
| 0:10:09| guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=609)|
| 0:10:19| I'm not sure if this is actually, you just said you're available to answer questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=619)|
| 0:10:23| about these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=623)|
| 0:10:24| It may not fit into one of those things, so it might be for Director Brooks or it might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=624)|
| 0:10:27| be for the commission just to weigh in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=627)|
| 0:10:35| For this particular case, it relates to other buildings and part of that is with view.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=635)|
| 0:10:45| My question is, is there any type of city ordinance that addresses specifically views?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=645)|
| 0:10:57| I'm thinking about, we've had some development over in South Knoxville where views have been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=657)|
| 0:11:02| significantly altered and here we would have views being significantly altered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=662)|
| 0:11:07| Is there anything that addresses that particular item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=667)|
| 0:11:12| I'm not aware of any city ordinance that deals with view sheds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=672)|
| 0:11:17| Is anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=677)|
| 0:11:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| I'm game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=679)|
| 0:11:20| Just a quick question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=680)|
| 0:11:27| How many times has this been in front of the design review board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=687)|
| 0:11:31| It has been in front of the design review board three times as a formal application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=691)|
| 0:11:35| so it was reviewed in April, May, and June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=695)|
| 0:11:39| Before that, they did a workshop with the design review board in November 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=699)|
| 0:11:44| We encourage for large projects like this, applicants to bring preliminary drawings in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=704)|
| 0:11:50| front of the DRB as a sort of workshop format to get informal feedback that's non-binding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=710)|
| 0:11:56| in advance just to kind of help people wrap their minds around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=716)|
| 0:11:59| So that's four times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| Correct me if I'm wrong, I guess through those three or four meetings, how you look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=720)|
| 0:12:11| the developer was trying to make changes to it to make it fit better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=731)|
| 0:12:15| Is that what was happening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=735)|
| 0:12:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=737)|
| 0:12:18| I would say they received pretty extensive feedback from the various design review board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=738)|
| 0:12:23| members and there was also a significant public comment portion in there and then there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| revisions submitted each time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| So the May meeting there were revisions to the building and then the June meeting there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=750)|
| 0:12:34| were revisions to the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=754)|
| 0:12:36| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=756)|
| 0:12:37| So it's been, I guess, been pretty well vetted, I guess, with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=759)|
| 0:12:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=760)|
| 0:12:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=761)|
| 0:12:42| I followed this throughout a lot of the DRB meetings and watched some of those back when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=762)|
| 0:12:51| they were live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=771)|
| 0:12:55| One thing that has concerned me about this throughout that whole process is the stucco| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=775)|
| 0:13:03| on the facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Can you speak to whether that was, I know that there were a lot of things discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=784)|
| 0:13:10| about this, so I'm not sure if some of the other things maybe took priority, but that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| just always concerned me about this project just with the size of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=797)|
| 0:13:23| Any thoughts on discussion around that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=803)|
| 0:13:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| So in the staff report, we did unpack the concept of materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=807)|
| 0:13:32| I will say there wasn't extensive discussion about the cladding from the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=812)|
| 0:13:38| In terms of the guidelines, they recommend building materials that relate to scale, durability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| color and texture of predominant building materials in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=824)|
| 0:13:47| So this block of West Hill Avenue has a pretty wide array of exterior materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=827)|
| 0:13:51| There's contemporary and historic brick masonry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=831)|
| 0:13:54| There is some stucco on that block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| There's wood siding and then there are also contemporary office building and parking structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| In the opinion of staff and in the staff report, we broke down that hard coat stucco is compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| with the context and then they do provide, to break up the different massings, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| are different exterior materials, including the brick veneer on the Hill Avenue elevation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=853)|
| 0:14:20| and then the metal on the locust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=860)|
| 0:14:25| I would just encourage everyone ahead of Thursday to maybe look at, for example, Vaugh Hall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=865)|
| 0:14:35| on White Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| That's a stucco building and again, the long-term maintenance of this is something that I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=876)|
| 0:14:46| like to discuss more, the stucco material.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| Otherwise, I think it's a good project and if there's a representative for the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| here, I would like to maybe hear if on Thursday, if there's other materials they would be willing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=895)|
| 0:15:00| to consider in place of the stucco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=900)|
| 0:15:05| There's one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=905)|
| 0:15:12| Can you pull up the view of the project that shows its relationship to Naland and the river?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=912)|
| 0:15:22| I can provide some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| There are some renderings in the application packet and we can go through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=923)|
| 0:15:35| Is this the one you're looking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| Actually, I'm trying to, I guess, have the view from Naland or from the river, not from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=941)|
| 0:15:48| him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| Okay, yeah, that helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=949)|
| 0:15:50| That's Front Avenue right here and that's locust.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=950)|
| 0:15:59| Just to confirm, that relationship with Naland does show pedestrian usage there and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=959)|
| 0:16:08| stair step up in terms of that setback, the third story?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=968)|
| 0:16:15| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=975)|
| 0:16:16| The building step back is shown there and then there is a step back on the other elevation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| that's closer to Henley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=980)|
| 0:16:25| The additional application packet does have some information on the pedestrian access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=985)|
| 0:16:32| on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=992)|
| 0:16:33| Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| You can also see this here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=994)|
| 0:16:37| They have provided some information on very preliminary proposed crosswalks and landscaping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=997)|
| 0:16:45| and sidewalks around that property as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1005)|
| 0:16:48| Okay, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1008)|
| 0:16:51| Lindsay, can I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| In reviewing this application or this case, should we basically look at what the design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1015)|
| 0:17:01| review guidelines were and in our opinion decide whether the applicant met those guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1021)|
| 0:17:14| and then if not, maybe recommend changes to what was approved by the design review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1034)|
| 0:17:22| guideline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1042)|
| 0:17:23| Is that how we should look at it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1043)|
| 0:17:25| Yeah, I'm going to defer to the director for that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| Yes, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1048)|
| 0:17:29| As Lindsay mentioned, you all are supposed to consider it like a new application, obviously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1049)|
| 0:17:35| taking into consideration what has already been recommended on this particular project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1055)|
| 0:17:41| but it is within your purview to affirm, to modify, send it back to DRB or overrule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1061)|
| 0:17:48| their decision altogether.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1068)|
| 0:17:50| So yes, you all can put additional conditions on the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1070)|
| 0:17:56| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1076)|
| 0:17:58| Yeah, and so is the person who is the overlook association that wrote the appeal, is there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1078)|
| 0:18:05| something that they are in disagreement with on the approval or do they just want it denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1085)|
| 0:18:10| They will, on Thursday, be here to make their case as well of why you all should overrule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1090)|
| 0:18:20| the decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| Now we are going to turn it over to Michelle for agenda item 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1103)|
| 0:18:42| We have a couple of ordinances we want to review with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1122)|
| 0:18:47| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1127)|
| 0:18:57| This is number 19 on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| It's pertaining to a city ordinance 4-A-24-OA, standards for multiple lots without street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1138)|
| 0:19:05| frontage using access easements and flag lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1145)|
| 0:19:12| So just a brief history or summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1152)|
| 0:19:14| So when you are subdividing a single property into multiple lots, there is typically a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1154)|
| 0:19:18| of how access will be provided to the newly created lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| Because access for the single lot is already in existence and in many cases provides the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| sole means of access to the entire property, that access point will need to be extended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1164)|
| 0:19:29| somehow to encompass the new lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| Providing access has historically been a little more challenging depending on the width of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1171)|
| 0:19:36| that access point, especially because previously in the subdivision regulations we only had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1176)|
| 0:19:41| one type of access easement available to residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| And that was the exclusive permanent access easement or the EPAE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1184)|
| 0:19:50| It could serve only one additional lot beyond the lot it crossed through for access to a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| public street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| And once an additional lot was created, a private right of way was required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1194)|
| 0:19:58| And there's two sets of standards for private right of way, those that serve up to six lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| and those that serve six lots or more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1202)|
| 0:20:05| But either way, there are many criteria to meet, some of which were not necessary for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| one additional property or basically a two lot subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1209)|
| 0:20:15| So this led to people sometimes creating a series of adjacent flag lots instead with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1215)|
| 0:20:21| the flag stems appearing one right after another, as you can see here, multiple access points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1221)|
| 0:20:26| concentrated in one particular area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1226)|
| 0:20:29| And for people who may not be familiar with the term flag lot, it's a type of lot where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| access to the public street is provided along a narrow access strip that we call a flag| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| stem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| And the shape of the lot itself is typically rectangular, though it doesn't really have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1237)|
| 0:20:40| to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| Typically, this configuration allows one or more lots to be created beyond an existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1241)|
| 0:20:45| house by creating a driveway in the flag stem portion that connects to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| And so this option negated the need for an access easement agreement and allowed each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| property owner to own their own access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1254)|
| 0:20:56| However, it also created a situation where multiple driveways or access point occurred| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| very close together, often on classified streets, which creates a safety concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1260)|
| 0:21:05| And particularly, you can see in this example how there is a blind curve right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1265)|
| 0:21:11| So that led to the creation of the shared permanent access easement, or the SPAE for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1271)|
| 0:21:17| short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1277)|
| 0:21:18| And so that allowed people to divide between two and five lots using one means of access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1278)|
| 0:21:23| versus the multiple flag stems that you see here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| It should be noted that the last update to the subdivision regulations, all of the various| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| access easement types were combined into one in the subdivision regulations, though they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| did retain the requirements that were within the SPAE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| And so that brings us all to the flag lot portion of our proposal, where we're proposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1300)|
| 0:21:45| that serial flag lots be prohibited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1305)|
| 0:21:48| Since the access easement does provide a safer path forward, the prohibition does not limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1308)|
| 0:21:54| the ability to subdivide the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| And so we're also saying a flag lot is a part of the development where the flag stem or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| access strip holds that access easement for other lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1321)|
| 0:22:04| We're proposing that that be subject to a new subsection we're creating, which I'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| go over shortly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| The other things for flag lots, we are proposing for dwellings on a singular flag lot to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| staggered so that 70% of the new structure is located out of a projected line, the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1336)|
| 0:22:22| in front, so that they're not directly behind the front dwelling, to avoid situations where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| the front flag lot is directly behind and facing the rear of the dwelling in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1347)|
| 0:22:31| If that's not possible, we're proposing a class A landscape buffer be installed in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1351)|
| 0:22:35| front of the flag lot dwelling to create a visual screen from the view of the dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1359)|
| 0:22:42| And so that brings us to the other issue we're having, is that the city's zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| currently requires all structures to face the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1366)|
| 0:22:50| This creates a situation where the rear house is likely to be directly behind the house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| facing the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1374)|
| 0:22:55| So again, its applicants have a view of the rear facade of the structure in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1375)|
| 0:23:00| The city has seen some variance requests as a result of this requirement for non-street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| facing lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| So while an access may solve the problem, the easement may solve the problem of multiple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| access points, it's still subject to many of the same issues as a series of flag lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1389)|
| 0:23:13| when it comes to development pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1393)|
| 0:23:16| So in terms of building orientation, it creates a situation where the front of one house faces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| the rear of the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1400)|
| 0:23:21| It lacks cohesiveness in the site plan and a relationship between the structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1401)|
| 0:23:26| It also creates a pattern of houses that lack a strong relationship to the street, pulling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1406)|
| 0:23:30| them back and making them feel more isolated than other houses in a typical neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| pattern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| And it does not contribute to neighborhood character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| It creates developments where houses are hidden and pulled away from the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| So we are proposing for structures to be able to face the easement instead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1422)|
| 0:23:48| That's in situations where multiple non-facing lots use an access easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1428)|
| 0:23:53| So the front yard of those properties would face the easement with the front setback measured| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1433)|
| 0:23:56| from the access easement instead of from the lot line that runs parallel to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1436)|
| 0:24:01| This creates more of a street edge along the easement for a stronger relationship between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1441)|
| 0:24:04| the structures themselves and between the structures and the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1444)|
| 0:24:09| We note that this standard does not apply to the house that uses the easement that faces| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1449)|
| 0:24:15| the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| That would still be required to face the street to kind of continue that street relationship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1456)|
| 0:24:22| And so just kind of looking a little bit, before we dive into some of the other diagrams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1462)|
| 0:24:26| just wanted to be clear on how this works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1466)|
| 0:24:30| So the solid line here is the lot line, then the dash is the access easement that holds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1470)|
| 0:24:35| the drive aisle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| So the drive aisle is not the entire width of the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1476)|
| 0:24:39| They're two separate things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| Note here the easement terminates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| There's that solid line with the lot line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1482)|
| 0:24:44| The driveway of that lot continues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1484)|
| 0:24:47| And that's important basically because of the language that we've included in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1487)|
| 0:24:51| So when we were looking at Article 4.3.D, the proposal is for the lots without street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| frontage that use an access easement for access to be subject to the new requirements instead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| of the standard setback requirements of the zone for a situation where multiple lots without| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1500)|
| 0:25:05| street frontage are using the easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1505)|
| 0:25:08| And I'll turn on my laser pointer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| So again, there's that termination point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1512)|
| 0:25:15| So this is the projected lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1515)|
| 0:25:16| If that easement were to keep going, that's where that would occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1516)|
| 0:25:19| And so we're proposing for that front lot to also have that same setback starting point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| from measurement, if you will, to again promote that street edge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| So we're requiring a minimum front setback along the access easement to a new residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1530)|
| 0:25:34| structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1534)|
| 0:25:35| And 20 feet, if there is a carport or garage, and that's to allow for vehicle parking in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1535)|
| 0:25:40| front of the garage to meet the parking requirements of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| So lot width would be measured from side to side this way instead of what is typical this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1544)|
| 0:25:50| way, so not parallel to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1550)|
| 0:25:54| Side and rear rut setbacks would remain the same subject to the zone's requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1554)|
| 0:25:58| We're also proposing that block face setback requirements don't apply to lots without street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1558)|
| 0:26:04| frontage that use an access easement since they're not located on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1564)|
| 0:26:10| And to that end, we've added an asterisk next to the block face requirement in Table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1570)|
| 0:26:13| 4.1 with a note at the bottom referring to the new standard in 4.3.D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1573)|
| 0:26:20| So ultimately, the goal is to create a relationship between the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| I'm not going to go into all of the amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| There's a summary at the end of the memo, including your packet, that does provide a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1586)|
| 0:26:30| list of the affected sections pertaining to these standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| For example, the EN zone and standards for duplexes were affected, and they have new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1593)|
| 0:26:37| language that refers to this standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1597)|
| 0:26:39| They wouldn't be affected unless someone used an access easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| But I am happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1603)|
| 0:26:50| Will that access easement be a new street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1613)|
| 0:26:54| An access easement is not a street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1614)|
| 0:26:55| It's not a private right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| It's basically just using someone's lot to cross through it to get to access to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1618)|
| 0:27:02| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1622)|
| 0:27:03| So the access easement, it remains in the lot it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1623)|
| 0:27:07| So like this lot in the middle, for example, the easement crosses over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1627)|
| 0:27:11| It's technically part of this lot still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| It's just someone crosses over it to get to the next property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1633)|
| 0:27:16| So they are supposed to be kept free and clear for access, but they are not divided off and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1636)|
| 0:27:22| they're not their own entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1642)|
| 0:27:23| They're part of the lot that they are going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1643)|
| 0:27:27| So if someone wants to do this to their lot, if they could do it in the dimensions appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1647)|
| 0:27:36| to the current code, say it's RN1, RN2, would they have to still go through like a subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1656)|
| 0:27:44| approval process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1664)|
| 0:27:46| What would happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| They would still have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1668)|
| 0:27:49| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| Any subdivision requires approval at some level, whether it's administrative, by staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| or whether it comes for you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| So they would propose the plat with an application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| They submit that to our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1678)|
| 0:28:00| We take a look at it and make sure that it complies with all of our subdivision regulation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| standards and with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| It's a joint review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| So in the city, the city staff, they have a technical services division that reviews| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1687)|
| 0:28:12| it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1692)|
| 0:28:14| And then it goes out to other agencies and there's like a review and revision process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1694)|
| 0:28:18| until it meets all the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1698)|
| 0:28:20| So the easement itself is part of the subdivision regulations that's already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| So this is just proposing that the front of that access point be the front lot, the front| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1704)|
| 0:28:30| setback, and the front yard for that property that uses an access easement if it's not facing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1710)|
| 0:28:34| the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1714)|
| 0:28:35| And there are multiple of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1715)|
| 0:28:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1716)|
| 0:28:37| Michelle, pardon me if you already addressed this, but will that easement be a private| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1717)|
| 0:28:44| road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1724)|
| 0:28:45| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Or it will not be a private road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1727)|
| 0:28:48| So it's not required to be a private right-of-way unless there are six or more lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1728)|
| 0:28:53| And it's not required to be like any sort of street or anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1733)|
| 0:28:56| So it really is, it's almost like a shared agreement between property owners saying that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| you know, lot owner A saying, hey, lot owner B, lot owner C, you can use my property for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| your driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| So it's essentially like a shared driveway that extends through each property until you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1747)|
| 0:29:11| get to the ones behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| And who's responsible for maintaining that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1752)|
| 0:29:15| So there's an agreement that's drawn up that everyone has to sign that abuts it so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1755)|
| 0:29:18| if something happens or to maintain it, they all pull together and maintain it together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1758)|
| 0:29:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1763)|
| 0:29:27| It's super ironic because just last week we were discussing this in our office, trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1767)|
| 0:29:32| to figure out the difference between or discuss the difference between access easement, JPE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1772)|
| 0:29:39| and SPAE.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1779)|
| 0:29:40| Are you saying that this brings all of those together to where they can all act in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| same?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1784)|
| 0:29:46| That was actually done in the last update to the subdivision regulations, which I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1786)|
| 0:29:51| was a couple of months ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1791)|
| 0:29:53| It was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1793)|
| 0:29:54| So now instead of having the EPAE, the SPAE, the process access easement, those are all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1794)|
| 0:29:59| grouped together now under one term access easement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1799)|
| 0:30:02| They all have the same standards of the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| So there's like a 25 foot right of way width that's required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| There's the ability to ask for turnaround space by fire if that's needed, depending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| on the length of the driveway, grade, there's like a 12% grade is the max, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1813)|
| 0:30:20| The other thing that we were discussing is a lot of times I've seen there'll be a single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| flag lot and then smaller lots building up to it and the JPE is on the flag lot to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1826)|
| 0:30:33| You're saying part of what my staff and I were talking about is why there's not more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1833)|
| 0:30:42| situations where it's just an access easement going across multiple parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1842)|
| 0:30:49| With this change, is that permitted where you don't have to have that access easement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1849)|
| 0:30:56| on its own parcel or on one single parcel?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1856)|
| 0:30:59| It can cross all of those parcels the full length?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1859)|
| 0:31:05| It can cross multiple parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| Is there a limit to how many it can or how far?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| I guess there's turnaround regulations, but does that come into play with like whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1870)|
| 0:31:18| it's four parcels or two dozen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1878)|
| 0:31:21| The fire is based on the distance of the driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1881)|
| 0:31:23| It's 150 feet at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1883)|
| 0:31:25| You can ask for a turnaround.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1885)|
| 0:31:28| We can definitely sideline about it because it's not part of these regulations and I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1888)|
| 0:31:31| we've got a lot of items to get through today, so I don't mean to cut the conversation off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| but we're not really voting on the access easement itself at the Thursday meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1895)|
| 0:31:42| The last question, you mentioned the setbacks, front setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1902)|
| 0:31:46| Is there a way, I know that there's typically a minimum setback, if not, or minimum with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1906)|
| 0:31:59| the average of block phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1919)|
| 0:32:01| Is there a way in this where in the subdivision that could be, like a setback could be defined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1921)|
| 0:32:11| If you were in a neighborhood where most of the houses were 15 feet from the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1931)|
| 0:32:15| line but then the minimum is 20 or average block phase, could the subdivision actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1935)|
| 0:32:21| say all of these are going to be 15 or does it just outright default to the minimum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1941)|
| 0:32:30| The houses along the street would still follow the block phase requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1950)|
| 0:32:33| It's just the houses that are beyond that first level, that first row of houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| They would not follow the block phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1958)|
| 0:32:41| They would follow what we're proposing, assuming if it does get approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| I don't know if that answers your question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| Yeah, no, I was just curious if there's a way, because I know I've seen subdivisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1966)|
| 0:32:50| where they set setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1970)|
| 0:32:54| If there was a way to utilize different things, if there were specific cases, like if it were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1974)|
| 0:33:00| in an area where typically the house would be 15 from the street or something, but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| guess not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| So you're asking if there's flexibility built into this or the ability to build flexibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| into this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1990)|
| 0:33:11| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1991)|
| 0:33:12| I don't know that there really is at this point, and it's also going to just pertain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1992)|
| 0:33:17| to how wide the space is that they have to work with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| So I think if this, right now it's 10 feet, they could do bigger if they wanted to, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| they have the available land to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| I think if it went any smaller, then that's when they'd probably have to go to a BZA for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2010)|
| 0:33:34| a hardship, but they could certainly do deeper if they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2014)|
| 0:33:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2017)|
| 0:33:38| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2018)|
| 0:33:39| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2019)|
| 0:33:40| Now we're going to move on to agenda item number 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2020)|
| 0:33:49| So this one is in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2029)|
| 0:33:51| This is the addition of standards for drive-thru facilities and the addition to drive-thrus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| for the CA and CB zones, and then also I'm just referring to the drive-thru standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2036)|
| 0:34:02| in the commercial zones that already allow drive-thru facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2042)|
| 0:34:07| So brief history on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2047)|
| 0:34:08| This stemmed from the Alcoa Highway Study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| It was originally part of a larger group of amendments that went before county commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2051)|
| 0:34:15| in February and March of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2055)|
| 0:34:18| That group of amendments was sent back to the planning commission for further review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2058)|
| 0:34:22| at its second reading and was later separated into two separate parts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2062)|
| 0:34:27| So we worked with a group of stakeholders, including Knox County Codes and Administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2067)|
| 0:34:32| Knox County Engineering, members of the development community, Knox County Planning Alliance Group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2072)|
| 0:34:37| and a few Knox County commissioners also participated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2077)|
| 0:34:42| So the first of the separated amendments proposed residential uses to be added into the CA and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| CB zones was adopted in 2024.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2088)|
| 0:34:51| This amendment is for drive-thrus only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2091)|
| 0:34:55| And so just a quick comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| There are some zones that currently allow pharmacies, banks, and restaurants, but then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2096)|
| 0:35:01| they also delineate drive-thru uses, whereas in the CA and CB zones, it's just restaurants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2101)|
| 0:35:08| and banks and pharmacies allowed as one group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2108)|
| 0:35:11| So it kind of becomes a question of whether or not a drive-thru use would be allowed by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2111)|
| 0:35:15| rate like those other uses in CA and CB, or whether they would be a separate use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2115)|
| 0:35:23| And so this ordinance is just codifying that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2123)|
| 0:35:27| So part of the things that came out in the stakeholder meetings was some concern over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2127)|
| 0:35:32| the minor collectors and the distribution of the CA zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2132)|
| 0:35:35| I know we've talked about that in some of these ordinance amendments before, but there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| a lot of CA zoning in particular, some CB, but mostly CA, and scattered areas throughout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| the county, some of them in seemingly rural areas and residential areas, and there was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2145)|
| 0:35:50| some concern over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| So we looked at minor collectors in CA and CB zoning along minor collectors, and so I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| not going to go into Exhibit A, B, and C at this time, but I will just let you know how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| to read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| So when you're looking at Exhibit B, anything that's blue, that was where a commercial occurrence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| was on one of these major collectors, and it was counted towards the totals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| We looked at several different criteria pertaining to minor collectors, and that's things as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2174)|
| 0:36:21| whether it was next to a residential street, if it was supported by the place type, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2181)|
| 0:36:26| it was in the county's rural area, and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2186)|
| 0:36:30| That's all worth noting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2190)|
| 0:36:33| The breakdown of Exhibit B, so if it was at the intersection of a minor collector and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2193)|
| 0:36:40| an arterial, or a minor collector and a major collector, then it was not counted here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2200)|
| 0:36:46| If it was on two different minor collectors, it was only counted once, and then the notes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| along here on the side, that's going to tell you whether or not it was counted and where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2211)|
| 0:36:54| it's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2214)|
| 0:36:56| It's kind of a companion document to Exhibit C.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| It's also worthy to note that there's several instances of what appears to be commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2221)|
| 0:37:07| notes when you look at the zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2227)|
| 0:37:09| There'll be a group of parcels zoned commercially, but then when you look at the existing land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| use, you see it's residential, single family residential, vacant, rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2232)|
| 0:37:17| This one's a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2237)|
| 0:37:19| When you look at the aerial view, it's really quite rural in feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2239)|
| 0:37:28| And then Exhibit C, like I said, that's a companion to Exhibit B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2248)|
| 0:37:32| So the maps are in the same order as Exhibit B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| So if there's something that you want to see, you can just scroll to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| And should you be inclined to look at these, that's how they work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| And then diving into how that's all collected and how we looked at it, so there were 53| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2261)|
| 0:37:46| different minor collector streets that had instances of C.A. and C.B. zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| Some of those had multiple parcels and multiple occurrences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| So then we looked at those individual occurrences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| There were 69 that occurred along C.A. and C.B. zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| Again, some with multiple parcels, so it's not a parcel count.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2280)|
| 0:38:03| It's just a number of how many times these things occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| 52 were not in an existing commercial area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| That's by land use, not by zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2290)|
| 0:38:12| 23 occurrences were in the county's rural area of the growth policy plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| 59 were not supported by the comprehensive plan's designated place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2296)|
| 0:38:21| And 40 were in properties that were not developed that could be developed today with anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2301)|
| 0:38:26| that's allowed by right in C.A. or C.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2306)|
| 0:38:33| So this data led us to limit drive-throughs on minor collectors to properties that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| not located in the county's rural area as designated on the growth policy map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2317)|
| 0:38:41| So they're allowed by right on arterials, and they're by use on review in major collectors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2321)|
| 0:38:47| But on minor collectors, they're used on review if they are not in the county's rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2327)|
| 0:38:52| That's what we were proposing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2332)|
| 0:38:54| But regardless, there are some standards for drive-through facilities that we've developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| There's two different levels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| So in general, for any zone, a drive-through would have to meet these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2339)|
| 0:39:04| There's general standards for drive-throughs establishing, stacking of vehicles, and vehicle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2344)|
| 0:39:09| light screening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| So drive-through lanes have to be located and designed to ensure that they don't adversely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2350)|
| 0:39:16| affect traffic circulation on adjoining streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2356)|
| 0:39:19| And then there's minimum stacking requirements to kind of help with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2359)|
| 0:39:23| So there's four vehicles that can be stacked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2363)|
| 0:39:25| That's a minimum for a restaurant, and then there's three for other drive-throughs like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2365)|
| 0:39:28| a bank or a pharmacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2368)|
| 0:39:31| There's standards for the width of the lane and for vehicular light screening from public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2371)|
| 0:39:35| rights-of-way for safety purposes to avoid glare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2375)|
| 0:39:39| Store speakers are capped at 75 decibels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| This is in alignment with the county's noise ordinance requirements for commercial businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| between the hours of 10 and 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| And so 75 decimals, that sounds pretty arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2391)|
| 0:39:53| Most of us don't know how that really relates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| So here's some data from the Center of Hearing and Communication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2395)|
| 0:40:00| So they've noted that normal conversation typically registers at 60 decibels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2400)|
| 0:40:07| But they've also grouped together some of these other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2407)|
| 0:40:10| So I've put a red box around those that are pretty similar to that 75-decibel level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2410)|
| 0:40:14| So an alarm clock registers at 65 to 80, TV audio at 70, coffee grinder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2414)|
| 0:40:21| There's power lawnmowers in this one, freeway traffic, things like that, just for a little| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2421)|
| 0:40:25| bit of context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2425)|
| 0:40:29| And so all of that led us to believe that there should probably be an additional level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2429)|
| 0:40:33| of standards for drive-throughs when they are next to residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2433)|
| 0:40:38| And so for these, we've got sound level, we've got speaker box location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2438)|
| 0:40:44| So the sound level here would be measured at the property line between a shared residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2444)|
| 0:40:49| use or shared property line of a residential use and a commercial business with a drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2449)|
| 0:40:54| And that's 65 decibels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2454)|
| 0:40:56| And the speaker box location, we're proposing for that to be mounted on a separate box next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2456)|
| 0:41:01| to the car with the drive-through lane having maneuverability to allow the car to drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2461)|
| 0:41:07| right up to that box so that the sound is going from the box, being absorbed into the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2467)|
| 0:41:11| car versus being in the menu board and being dispersed into the environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2471)|
| 0:41:16| We also have noise reduction methods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2476)|
| 0:41:18| If the sound level can't be achieved through those design methods, there's a design mechanism| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2478)|
| 0:41:24| that drive-through speakers can use that allow you to turn the volume up and down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2484)|
| 0:41:29| HUD's noise guidebook provided some barrier wall standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| That's included as the preferred method, but it's not required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| There's other things like that that can be done to attenuate the sound.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2495)|
| 0:41:41| So looking at exterior lighting standards, there's standards for lighting levels, dimming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2501)|
| 0:41:46| devices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| We're recommending a cap of 0.2 foot candles at shared residential lot lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2507)|
| 0:41:53| This is higher than what you'd see by Dark Sky International, by the Illuminating Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2513)|
| 0:41:57| Society or the U.S. Green Building Council, but it is in compliance or in alignment with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2517)|
| 0:42:04| the county's strictest lighting standards that we currently have, and that's the TO| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2528)|
| 0:42:09| And so we didn't feel like it was appropriate for us to be any stricter here on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2529)|
| 0:42:12| that would be allowed in a base zone, so that's why we kept it at that same level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2532)|
| 0:42:19| So for landscaping, there's two options for screening at shared residential lot lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2539)|
| 0:42:24| One of them involves staggered evergreen trees with shrubs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| The other has got staggered evergreen trees with staggered ornamental trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2548)|
| 0:42:34| They've got options they can choose from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2554)|
| 0:42:36| But if the drive-through is situated where the lane makes the vehicle light shine directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2556)|
| 0:42:40| into a residential property, then we are requiring shrubs to be planted there at a height of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2560)|
| 0:42:44| four feet to capture that standard headlight height, so that would keep the glare from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| going into people's windows if they're trying to sleep and things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| And with that, I'll take any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2573)|
| 0:42:59| I know that was a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| Yeah, it's a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| Just to clarify thing one, are the changes that are being proposed here making drive-throughs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2585)|
| 0:43:19| no longer a use-on-review in any case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| So if they are located on an art—well, for CA and CB, if they're located on an arterial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| they would be a use-permitted by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| They would still be subject to the general standards of a drive-through, but they wouldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2610)|
| 0:43:33| come before you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| So then if it's located on a major collector, it's a use-on-review, you all would see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2614)|
| 0:43:39| If it's all on a minor collector, it's use-on-review, and you all would see it, but would it not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2619)|
| 0:43:43| be permissible if it was in the county's rural area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2623)|
| 0:43:48| Another question, just looking through the draft, one of the red lines noted that planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| commission would no longer be able to modify the hours of operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2634)|
| 0:43:59| I don't think that was saying that you couldn't modify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2639)|
| 0:44:02| It was just saying that it would be—it's not putting it in there that you will automatically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2642)|
| 0:44:08| do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2648)|
| 0:44:09| So we're going to be still asking for business hours to be provided, and as a use-on-review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| you all always have that ability to make those kinds of condition changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2654)|
| 0:44:21| That is not how this seemed to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2661)|
| 0:44:25| I see Commissioner Gill nodding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| Do you know the page number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2668)|
| 0:44:29| Are you looking at it right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2669)|
| 0:44:30| Yeah, so in the case file, it's page six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| It's under Exhibit A, and it's—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2671)|
| 0:44:36| It says the planning—thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| The planning commission may impose conditions modifying the permitted hours of operation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2678)|
| 0:44:43| and that line has been struck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| Okay, hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| Let me—that doesn't mean you can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2685)|
| 0:44:47| It's just not putting it automatically that you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| So it's not taking away the right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| It's just not putting it in the ordinance amendment that you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2691)|
| 0:44:55| It's not saying that you cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| So it's not replacing the language that you can with by saying that the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2697)|
| 0:45:02| cannot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2702)|
| 0:45:03| But if you—hold on one second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| Let me try to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2704)|
| 0:45:05| If it's not—if it's being struck because it doesn't want to plant the idea of imposing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2705)|
| 0:45:13| conditions in the planning commission's mind, I think it should still stay there because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2713)|
| 0:45:20| when you're trying to make decisions on this, and we've already heard this earlier in today's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| session, we need guidance about what we can and can't do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2725)|
| 0:45:30| So if this line is saying you may do this, I think it's helpful, but—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2730)|
| 0:45:36| Will you remind me what page number you're on so I can pull that up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| Sure, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2739)|
| 0:45:40| Page six from the version that's online, and it's Exhibit A, Proposed Amendments to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2740)|
| 0:45:46| Zoning Code, item two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| So six on the—this part, not six down here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2748)|
| 0:45:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2752)|
| 0:45:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2753)|
| 0:45:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2755)|
| 0:45:56| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| So you're proposing that we want to keep that line in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2758)|
| 0:46:04| It seems like it's not—you're saying if we strike it, we still have the ability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2764)|
| 0:46:10| And I'm saying if we strike it, the people sitting around here may not realize that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2770)|
| 0:46:14| have the ability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2774)|
| 0:46:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| So it seems like if it's left in, it's still not saying that we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2776)|
| 0:46:21| It's just reminding us that we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2781)|
| 0:46:24| That you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| That was just something that came out of the stakeholder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| I mean, if you all wanted to make a motion and approve this without striking that line,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2787)|
| 0:46:33| you certainly could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| You've clarified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2796)|
| 0:46:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2797)|
| 0:46:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2798)|
| 0:46:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2799)|
| 0:46:40| Thank you, Michelle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2800)|
| 0:46:41| We're going to move on to—we have another ordinance amendment in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2801)|
| 0:46:46| It's item number 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2806)|
| 0:46:50| And as Mike is getting hooked up, I'll just give a little background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| So this code amendment before you has been on Planning's Work Program for several years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2812)|
| 0:46:59| and was replaced there at the request of City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2819)|
| 0:47:02| Looks like Mike's ready to go, so I'll just turn it over to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2822)|
| 0:47:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2828)|
| 0:47:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2829)|
| 0:47:10| So as Director Books just mentioned, this has been on our Work Program for a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2830)|
| 0:47:15| It was a request by City Council to consider and make recommendations for adding architectural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2835)|
| 0:47:22| design guidelines to the CG-1 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2842)|
| 0:47:26| The CG zone has three levels of intensity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2846)|
| 0:47:28| It's the CG-1, CG-2, and CG-3 zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2848)|
| 0:47:34| And as the numbers go higher, the more intense the zone—the more intensity the zones allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2854)|
| 0:47:41| The CG-2 and CG-3 zones already have design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2861)|
| 0:47:44| The CG-1 does not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2864)|
| 0:47:47| Other things that we are considering as part of this—and this wasn't necessarily part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2867)|
| 0:47:54| of the request from City Council, but it's more of a clarifying item, which is to clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| which design standards apply for residential structures in these non-residential zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2880)|
| 0:48:05| So I'll step through that in just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2885)|
| 0:48:07| Ultimately, the recommendation is to essentially apply the CG-2, CG-3 design standards to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2887)|
| 0:48:13| CG-1 and also make that clarifying language for residential structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2893)|
| 0:48:20| One of the driving factors here is the intent of the CG zone, which I highlight on the right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2900)|
| 0:48:26| side, which is to promote mixed-use development in a pedestrian-oriented environment that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2906)|
| 0:48:32| recalls the city's traditional business districts and offers flexibility in the creation of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| integrated commercial office and residential spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2918)|
| 0:48:42| And that's across the board—CG-1, CG-2, and CG-3—and as I step through the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| real quick—or the design standards—you'll see that, really, if we're trying to apply—if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2927)|
| 0:48:53| this is the intent of the zone district in all three intensity levels, the guidelines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2933)|
| 0:48:58| or design standards that are already in place for the CG-2 and CG-3 should just be brought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2938)|
| 0:49:03| over to the CG-1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| Real quick, I just wanted to show what the difference between the three districts are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2947)|
| 0:49:12| from a dimensional standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2952)|
| 0:49:14| So this is not changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2954)|
| 0:49:17| These are the dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| The main difference between the CG-1 and the CG-2 and CG-3 is CG-1 has a lower height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2959)|
| 0:49:27| limit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2967)|
| 0:49:28| CG-2, CG-3 have higher maximum heights and in the CG-3, technically, it's unlimited height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2968)|
| 0:49:38| But the CG-2 and CG-3 have what we call build-to zones, which require buildings to be moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| forward to the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2984)|
| 0:49:45| So a certain percentage of the building has to be within, you know, one to—zero to fifteen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2985)|
| 0:49:51| or zero to twenty feet of the front property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2991)|
| 0:49:55| In the CG-1, there is no build-to zone, so really, the building can be located anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=2995)|
| 0:50:01| on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3001)|
| 0:50:02| It could be pushed up to the street, just like the CG-2 and CG-3 could be pushed back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3002)|
| 0:50:07| towards the back of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3007)|
| 0:50:09| There's no restriction there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3009)|
| 0:50:14| So going into the design guidelines, I'm not going to go through these in complete detail| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3014)|
| 0:50:22| but just want to highlight a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| So applicability, this is only for new structures and for additions of 30% or more to an existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3025)|
| 0:50:33| structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| There's three different elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3037)|
| 0:50:38| There's a facade design, finistration design, and commercial site design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3038)|
| 0:50:44| Facade design is only for face—facades facing a public road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3044)|
| 0:50:52| Finistration design is, again, for facades facing a—for front facades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3052)|
| 0:50:58| So that's literally the front of the building facing a road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3058)|
| 0:51:02| If there's a side elevation facing a road, that's not the front facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3062)|
| 0:51:06| So finistration does not apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| Finistration is the things like glass area, doors, anything that's a penetration through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3069)|
| 0:51:14| the wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| There's two different elements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3076)|
| 0:51:18| There's a ground floor finistration, 30% along the—I'll get into it in more detail in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3078)|
| 0:51:26| second but 30% along the ground floor, 15% on all upper floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3086)|
| 0:51:30| And then the blast part of it is really a more like a best practice kind of a situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3090)|
| 0:51:35| for the commercial site design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| And the intent is there is just to create, you know, it—or to ensure safe pedestrian| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3099)|
| 0:51:44| access from the public right away and through the site to basically the end locations where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3104)|
| 0:51:49| the pedestrian is going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3109)|
| 0:51:57| Facade and finistration design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| So if you look at the building on the—I'll get my pointer on here, on the left, the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3120)|
| 0:52:09| floor finistration is 30% transparency between 2 and 10 feet from the ground level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3129)|
| 0:52:15| So we're not looking at the very bottom of the elevation, we're looking at the area of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3135)|
| 0:52:21| a storefront that's where you would typically see more glass area to begin with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3141)|
| 0:52:26| On the upper levels, it's only 15% but that's the entire wall area of each floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3146)|
| 0:52:32| Another element is the blank walls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3152)|
| 0:52:35| Blank walls in—is basically anything that does not have some kind of finistration, doors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3155)|
| 0:52:44| decorative elements, banding, medallions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3164)|
| 0:52:46| So anything that has some level of articulation to the facade is not considered a blank wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3166)|
| 0:52:52| It's literally just like same material, flat across, no change, that's a blank wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3172)|
| 0:52:59| On the ground floor, it's 30 feet horizontal length, you can't have a blank wall longer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| On upper floors, it's both horizontal and vertical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3186)|
| 0:53:14| This is just a couple more examples of how the code tries to show you how the elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3194)|
| 0:53:19| work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| But if anybody has questions, I'll be happy to discuss that a bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3200)|
| 0:53:26| And just a quick example of the site design standards, you know, the building on the left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3206)|
| 0:53:31| is kind of getting network wanting a sidewalk from the public right of way to the structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3211)|
| 0:53:40| you know, good access around the structure for pedestrians.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3220)|
| 0:53:44| And on the right is one of the older developments, you know, it just weren't required to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| There's no sidewalk to the public road, obviously, there's no sidewalk in front of this building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| but still at some point in time, there will be, so we want to get that set in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3231)|
| 0:54:01| Building materials are also part of the design guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| So on the left, there are some building material restrictions and even though they call this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3244)|
| 0:54:10| prohibited materials, technically, you can use up to 25% of the facade can have these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3250)|
| 0:54:20| materials so it's not a complete prohibition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3260)|
| 0:54:24| Concrete masonry units of CMU blocks is typical flat blocks, aluminum, metal, you know, like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3264)|
| 0:54:32| aluminum steel and other metal sidings that are not considered architectural metal siding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3272)|
| 0:54:36| it's a kind of a nuance but architectural wall panels are a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3276)|
| 0:54:42| Exposed aggregate concrete walls, T11 composite plywood, plastics and vinyls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3282)|
| 0:54:47| So those are all elements that are limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3287)|
| 0:54:51| Then for the residential design standards which was the part that the city council didn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3291)|
| 0:54:56| necessarily ask for but it's probably important to just go ahead and clarify in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3296)|
| 0:55:04| So right now, residential structures have two different design element or design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3304)|
| 0:55:11| if you're in a non-residential zone like the CG zones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| They have to meet both the commercial design standards that we just discussed and the principle| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3314)|
| 0:55:20| use standards of article 9.3 and this create conflicts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3320)|
| 0:55:26| So you're basically trying to meet two separate design standards with a structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3326)|
| 0:55:33| So what the proposal is, is just to say, okay, if this is a residential structure in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| these non-residential zones, they just need to meet the principle use standards when there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3338)|
| 0:55:44| a conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3344)|
| 0:55:45| So transparency levels is one conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3345)|
| 0:55:53| Basically like for a multifamily structure, an apartment building, principle use standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3353)|
| 0:55:57| say 20% transparency for the entire facade but then you go look at the commercial design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3357)|
| 0:56:05| standards and it says 30% on the ground floor, 15% on the upper floors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3365)|
| 0:56:10| So you have that conflict going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3370)|
| 0:56:13| With this amendment, residential structures would just only meet the principle use standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3373)|
| 0:56:21| If there's not a conflict, then the commercial standard would still apply but only when there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3381)|
| 0:56:28| a conflict, it goes to the principle use standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3388)|
| 0:56:34| This is just an example of how the zoning code, again, is trying to show how the different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3394)|
| 0:56:38| design standards apply and if I'll answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3398)|
| 0:56:45| Mike, would parking be allowed in front of the building in CG1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3410)|
| 0:56:56| Where is that on there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3416)|
| 0:57:00| I understand you're putting CG2, CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3420)|
| 0:57:03| These guidelines that you just went over are now going to be applicable to CG1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3423)|
| 0:57:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3428)|
| 0:57:10| As I mentioned, CG1 does not have a parking location standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3430)|
| 0:57:21| A building can be located anywhere on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3441)|
| 0:57:24| It can be pushed back to the back, it can be pushed up to the front of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3444)|
| 0:57:27| or to the side, it can be pushed to the side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| It's really a more flexible zone district than the CG2 and CG3 from a building location standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3450)|
| 0:57:37| There's nothing in the current design standards that says, like in the CG2 and CG3 that said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3457)|
| 0:57:44| you cannot have parking in front of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3464)|
| 0:57:46| Because technically, I'll go to this example here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3466)|
| 0:57:52| It's kind of, it's not, kind of think of this as an L-shaped building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3472)|
| 0:57:58| So, say what, if the cut was more like here, you'd have a space in front of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3478)|
| 0:58:05| So, the CG2 and CG3 only require a certain amount of the building to be located close to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3485)|
| 0:58:13| So, you could have an L-shaped building in both of those zones where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3493)|
| 0:58:23| part of the building is close to the road and part of it's further back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3503)|
| 0:58:26| and you could have parking in front of part of the building between the road and the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3506)|
| 0:58:32| So, it's just not very easy to fit parking between all of the buildings in CG2 and CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3512)|
| 0:58:39| It's virtually impossible because of the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| So, if there is parking in front of CG1, is there now landscaping required?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3522)|
| 0:58:48| Landscaping is, there's parking lot landscaping standards that apply in some instances for larger parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3528)|
| 0:58:59| There's also site design or site landscaping that's required along the base of buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3539)|
| 0:59:06| when the building is more than 10 feet away from the public road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| or when there's parking adjacent to that facade of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3550)|
| 0:59:14| What about between like the sidewalk and the parking lot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3554)|
| 0:59:19| Anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3559)|
| 0:59:20| It depends on the size of the parking lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3560)|
| 0:59:22| If it's, I'm not sure, I think Brian's already left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3562)|
| 0:59:27| Yeah, and again, I just want to clarify that this is just aligning the design standards across CG1, CG2 and CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3567)|
| 0:59:44| We didn't, this is not addressing any other portion of the code or the dimensional standards of CG1, 2 or 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3584)|
| 0:59:51| So, this is just aligning those design standards across the three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| If the parking lot is less than 10,000 square feet, I think, then there's not interior parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3596)|
| 1:00:05| I don't think there's external perimeter parking or landscaping either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3605)|
| 1:00:10| I'm sorry, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3610)|
| 1:00:14| Yeah, I'd have to look at that code a little closer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3614)|
| 1:00:18| There's a six foot front on the smaller lots, but not on the interior perimeter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3618)|
| 1:00:24| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3624)|
| 1:00:30| My questions are about understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3630)|
| 1:00:34| It seems like the big differentiator here is that these new proposed guidelines would be bringing into alignment, as you said, Director Brooks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3634)|
| 1:00:48| the design standards for CG2, CG3, bringing those over to CG1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| because we have run into a few instances where there just haven't been any design guidelines and we've needed them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3653)|
| 1:00:59| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3659)|
| 1:01:00| Except for where the building is situated on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3660)|
| 1:01:07| That's a separate ordinance that we've worked on in the past and that you all will see again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3667)|
| 1:01:12| But this is just specifically design standards, because it has come up on a number of different occasions, like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3672)|
| 1:01:17| well, this property, if we could just do design standards, if we could just apply those across,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3677)|
| 1:01:22| those that already apply to 2 and 3, apply those in CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3682)|
| 1:01:26| But isn't the lot line where it's situated being pulled close to the road, wouldn't that be part of a design standard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3686)|
| 1:01:37| Not necessarily, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| I mean, I think that's part of the dimensional standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3698)|
| 1:01:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| So how does what we're talking about right here relate to the corridor work that we have discussed in the past about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3705)|
| 1:01:54| because that's where we're trying to build out that more walkable zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3714)|
| 1:02:00| kind of taking the downtown and expanding it as possible through these major arteries,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3720)|
| 1:02:07| and CG1 is the primary zone aligning or lining those arteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3727)|
| 1:02:12| How does this start to work in conjunction with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3732)|
| 1:02:17| I think it's all related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3737)|
| 1:02:19| I mean, you all have already considered those Bill 2 lines, those amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3739)|
| 1:02:25| This body passed amendments to the CG2 and CG3 along certain sections of corridors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3745)|
| 1:02:35| It went to city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3755)|
| 1:02:36| Then it got kicked back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3756)|
| 1:02:37| It's been on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3757)|
| 1:02:38| It just got removed from the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3758)|
| 1:02:40| So it will be something that you all will consider sometime in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3760)|
| 1:02:45| I don't know if I'm answering your question, but it's related,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3765)|
| 1:02:48| but I don't know that it necessarily has to be tied to these design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3768)|
| 1:02:54| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3774)|
| 1:02:55| I don't know if I'm answering your question or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| You are, because they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3777)|
| 1:02:59| You're answering it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3779)|
| 1:03:00| I hear you say they are related, but we're just looking at this one thing today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| You're going to see more stuff on CG1 soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3785)|
| 1:03:10| CG2 and CG3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3790)|
| 1:03:12| So there was an interest in looking at is there some type of flexibility that can be built into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3792)|
| 1:03:17| related to those Bill 2 lines and how those are applied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| and where they are applied along corridors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3800)|
| 1:03:22| based on areas that we think might have the potential to be more walkable in the near future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3802)|
| 1:03:27| Again, design standards and dimensional standards are only one component of walkability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3807)|
| 1:03:32| I would say that there are probably just a lot of other factors that go into making a place walkable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3812)|
| 1:03:38| that need to be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| Just to clarify one more time, what we're talking about today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3820)|
| 1:03:44| the design standards for CG2 and CG3 are in large part being brought over to CG1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3824)|
| 1:03:53| They are completely being brought over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3833)|
| 1:03:55| So it's the same design standards that are utilized in 2 and 3 will be applied to 1 as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3835)|
| 1:04:00| Except for where the building is positioned on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3840)|
| 1:04:05| We are not aligning all the dimensional standards across CG1 and CG2 and CG3 at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3845)|
| 1:04:10| That's not what our recommendation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| So if I am a CG1 owner, and I'm coming in the process now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3853)|
| 1:04:19| I've got design standards that I can look to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3859)|
| 1:04:23| but I still have the freedom to not worry about where my property is located on the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3863)|
| 1:04:30| Correct. Yeah, there's not a delta line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| And so is it currently the onus of Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3874)|
| 1:04:39| if that's the one big difference, and we see a brand new property coming in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| and they're asking for 1, 2, or 3,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| for our body to be really aware of that specific difference?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3888)|
| 1:04:53| Because if they are in CG1, the way that the automobiles move around that space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3893)|
| 1:05:00| and the way it's positioned is really going to be determined by that one zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3900)|
| 1:05:09| I think you all should take into consideration the dimensional standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3909)|
| 1:05:12| when you're considering those types of requests from CG2 and CG3 to CG1 and then vice versa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3912)|
| 1:05:18| whether or not it makes sense for that particular piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3918)|
| 1:05:34| Thank you. I think Mike still has the next one here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3934)|
| 1:05:37| Hawks Ridge, item number 43.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| This is a small subdivision in the Hardin Valley area on Samley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3940)|
| 1:05:45| I'm just going to quickly introduce the project and what the complex part of this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3945)|
| 1:05:54| It's a 28-lot subdivision, about 2.6 dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3954)|
| 1:06:00| The property was rezoned February 2024 to a planned residential up to 4.5 dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3960)|
| 1:06:09| This project also allows consideration of realigning Samley Road in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3969)|
| 1:06:17| by providing area for right-of-way on the south side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3977)|
| 1:06:21| We're recommending approval subject to 10 conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3981)|
| 1:06:25| The 10 conditions are pretty standard conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| There's not much there that is unique that I'm going to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| Just to give a quick overview of the location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| Hardin Valley Drive is shown here in the black dash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=3998)|
| 1:06:43| Steel Road, which is adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| This is the Hardin Valley school campus here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| Steel Road and then Samley Road parallels Hardin Valley for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4009)|
| 1:06:56| This is the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4016)|
| 1:07:00| The zoning in the area is predominantly ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| However, the property to the west is currently under rezoning consideration by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4023)|
| 1:07:10| I think it will be considered again in August by county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4030)|
| 1:07:17| Future land use in this area is traditional neighborhood for the most part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4037)|
| 1:07:22| I'm not going to go over this too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4042)|
| 1:07:25| I'm not going to go over this too much, but generally traditional neighborhood place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4045)|
| 1:07:31| The primary uses are single family and attached residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4051)|
| 1:07:36| which this project is detached residential single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4056)|
| 1:07:40| and recommends buildings about one to three stories in height,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4060)|
| 1:07:44| which is comparable to this project, as well as a 20-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4064)|
| 1:07:49| That's compatible with this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| The unique part of this is the variance request that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4073)|
| 1:08:00| A double frontage, this property has two existing road frontages and one future road frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4080)|
| 1:08:09| Samley Road is a collector, so it's classified.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4089)|
| 1:08:13| Double frontage lot is any lot that has two frontages along roads that do not intersect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4093)|
| 1:08:19| All these lots along Samley, except for these corner lots, are double frontage lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4099)|
| 1:08:27| The subdivision regulations say if the double frontage lot backs up to a collector arterial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| the average lot depth has to be 150 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| If it backs up to a local street, it's 135 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| It also considers future roads as if they're there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4120)|
| 1:08:46| Even though the future realignment of Samley is not built yet, it is a proposed road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4126)|
| 1:08:53| It would be a collector because Samley Road is currently a collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4133)|
| 1:08:57| Therefore, the double frontage lot standard applies to those lots as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4137)|
| 1:09:02| The unique thing here is Knox County is working with this property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4142)|
| 1:09:08| and the one to the west to realign Samley Road to get rid of the two 90-degree curves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4148)|
| 1:09:16| real sharp curves in Samley Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| When that happens, the existing Samley Road will be disconnected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4160)|
| 1:09:25| Most likely, everything is still kind of up in the air, exactly how it's going to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4165)|
| 1:09:30| Regardless, those will become at least local streets at the minimum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4170)|
| 1:09:36| which the minimum lot depth would be then 135 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4176)|
| 1:09:41| That's what they're asking for is variance to reduce the double frontage lot depth from 150 to 135| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4181)|
| 1:09:51| to match what the local street standard would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4191)|
| 1:09:57| They're also asking for 135-foot lot depth where the future Samley Road will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4197)|
| 1:10:08| That would reduce their lot depth by 15 feet more than what would otherwise be required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4208)|
| 1:10:15| Staff is recommending approval of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4215)|
| 1:10:20| I think it's kind of a unique situation that we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4220)|
| 1:10:29| If anybody has any questions, I'll be happy to ask or answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4229)|
| 1:10:39| Thank you, Mike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4239)|
| 1:10:42| Now we're going to move over to agenda item number 35.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4242)|
| 1:10:47| It's a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4247)|
| 1:10:50| There's some neighborhood concern about this particular piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4250)|
| 1:10:57| about the road not being wide enough to accommodate additional houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4257)|
| 1:11:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4273)|
| 1:11:19| This is a request to rezone from agricultural to low-density residential for a 3.36-acre property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4279)|
| 1:11:25| located on Gin Farm Drive south of Alcoa Highway and east of Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4285)|
| 1:11:30| It is worth noting that the property sits on the city of Knoxville boundary line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4290)|
| 1:11:35| The surrounding area consists largely of agricultural and residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4295)|
| 1:11:39| with commercial zones along Alcoa Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4299)|
| 1:11:42| In 2014, a rezoning from A1 general agricultural to R1 low-density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4302)|
| 1:11:47| was approved 50 feet south of the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4307)|
| 1:11:51| For context, this is what development looks like around the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| The surrounding residential development consists of varying lot sizes and housing types.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4314)|
| 1:12:00| The place type for this property and a significant amount of surrounding properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4320)|
| 1:12:04| is SR, suburban residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| This place type is appropriate for primarily low-density residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4326)|
| 1:12:10| that may feature a range of lot sizes and housing styles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| The northeastern and southwestern corners of the property fall within the hillside protection area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4333)|
| 1:12:18| but the overall site is sloped less than 15%, which is relatively flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4338)|
| 1:12:23| Coming from Alcoa Highway, Gin Farm Drive narrows from a two-lane road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4343)|
| 1:12:26| with a 21-foot pavement width to a 14-foot unstriped road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4346)|
| 1:12:30| The red arrow indicates where the road begins narrowing just before Ginbrook Lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4350)|
| 1:12:34| and continues down to Maloney Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4354)|
| 1:12:37| This portion of Gin Farm Drive has a vertical curve, which may impact site distance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| We received pointed public comments concerning the road width and site distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4361)|
| 1:12:44| and discussed the road conditions with city engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4364)|
| 1:12:47| that confirmed the widening of the road would likely be needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4367)|
| 1:12:51| but would be determined during the permitting phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4371)|
| 1:12:53| The applicant is aware of the potential need for road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4373)|
| 1:12:58| Staff recommends approving the RA low-density residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4378)|
| 1:13:02| because it is consistent with the SR place type and the Knox County Comprehensive Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4382)|
| 1:13:06| The rezoning complies with the Comprehensive Plan's implementation policy, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4386)|
| 1:13:11| to ensure that new development is sensitive to the existing community character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4391)|

| 1:13:20| Additionally, the presence of residential amenities within walking distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4400)|

| 1:13:27| to promote development within a walkable proximity to parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4407)|

| 1:13:41| Are there any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4421)|
| 1:13:44| Kelsey, it looks like this case file also suffers from the KGIS link not functioning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4424)|
| 1:13:52| So if that can be fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4432)|
| 1:13:55| Okay. We'll look into that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4435)|
| 1:13:58| It's working for me. We'll double check on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4438)|
| 1:14:00| When I've been clicking from the PDFs, this happened the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| and I messaged about it, but it's not going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4443)|
| 1:14:08| Okay. Thank you, Kelsey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4448)|
| 1:14:12| We are going to move on to Agenda Item Number 25.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4452)|
| 1:14:17| Samuel, the next two cases are his.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4457)|
| 1:14:27| Hello, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4467)|
| 1:14:29| This is an A to Z rezoning request along Thornbrook Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4469)|
| 1:14:35| For which we are recommending denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4475)|
| 1:14:37| We reviewed this postponed case in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4477)|
| 1:14:41| The area is primarily zoned agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| The CA zone on the property south of the street is legacy zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4484)|
| 1:14:49| However, majority of these properties have not been developed as commercial uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4489)|
| 1:14:54| And KGIS indicate that no new commercial development has been added to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4494)|
| 1:15:01| The property has the rural living place type, which leased the C and zone as partially related.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4501)|
| 1:15:07| Small scale commercial use is listed as a secondary use for this place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4507)|
| 1:15:13| In the existing land use map, we can see that most of the commercially zoned properties are developed as residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4513)|
| 1:15:21| There have not been any commercial developments in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4521)|
| 1:15:26| There have not been any substantial changes in the area in the last 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4526)|
| 1:15:33| The area remains rural in character and is primarily composed of houses on larger than half acre lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4533)|
| 1:15:40| Along the street and abutting undeveloped forested lands away from the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4540)|
| 1:15:47| Staff recommends denial of the C and zone because it does not meet all the conditions of rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4547)|
| 1:15:53| The zoning ordinance states that C and zone should generally be located at street intersections as close to the edge of a neighborhood as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4553)|
| 1:16:04| The property is located neither at an intersection nor at the edge of a neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4564)|
| 1:16:10| Furthermore, it can be argued that the property, the area does not have enough residential density to warrant the addition of more commercial zoned properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4570)|
| 1:16:21| The East County Community Plan identifies this road as rural corridor, which recommends limiting infrastructure expansion on this corridor to preserve the rural look and feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4581)|
| 1:16:33| The addition of another commercially zoned parcel would constitute encroachment into this rural residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4593)|
| 1:16:43| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4603)|
| 1:16:51| Thank you, Samuel. We're ready for the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4611)|
| 1:16:54| Thank you, Samuel. We're ready for the next one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4614)|
| 1:16:57| The next is item 36. It's a county rezoning request to go from A and RAE to PRA2 dwelling unit per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4617)|
| 1:17:08| With the requested density, they can have one more dwelling unit than their current zone would allow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4628)|
| 1:17:14| The density would be similar to the old flare subdivision across the subject property, as you can see on this zoning map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4634)|
| 1:17:23| The RAE zone here is older legacy zoning that predates the sector plans and the general plan that were in place prior to the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4643)|
| 1:17:35| The rural living place type of this property allows PR as a partially zoned, partially related zone with a density up to two dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4655)|
| 1:17:45| Staff recommends denial of the PR zone because there has not been any substantial changes in the area over the last 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4665)|
| 1:17:54| Additionally, PR zone is typically intended for larger properties, and this is only one acre property that may require a reduction of peripheral setback from 35 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4674)|
| 1:18:05| There are several public comments in opposition concerning the access to the site, water runoff, and type of dwelling to be proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4685)|
| 1:18:15| However, this can be reviewed under the development plan process if PR zone is approved here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4695)|
| 1:18:26| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4706)|
| 1:18:31| Okay. Thank you, Samuel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4711)|
| 1:18:35| Okay, now we're going to transition over to Jesse for agenda item number nine to start off with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4715)|
| 1:18:48| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4728)|
| 1:18:50| Okay, so we're starting with 6024RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4730)|
| 1:18:55| This is a rezoning case on a property that's almost 10 acres and is accessed by an easement to Grass Point Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4735)|
| 1:19:02| The request is to rezone from RAE exclusive residential to planned residential up to four dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4742)|
| 1:19:08| Staff are recommending approval of this rezoning with two conditions that would mitigate potential adverse impacts of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4748)|
| 1:19:15| Condition number one requires that disturbance within the hillside protection area not exceed the 4.98 acres that are recommended by the slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4755)|
| 1:19:24| Condition number two describes how the area is exceeding a 25% safety threshold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4764)|
| 1:19:28| The hillside protection area not exceed the 4.98 acres that are recommended by the slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4768)|
| 1:19:34| Condition number two describes how the area is exceeding a 25% slope along the rear lot line should remain undisturbed in addition to the 35-foot periphery boundary between the hillside protection area along the west side which abuts the Hanna Place subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4774)|
| 1:19:50| And those areas are shown in that exhibit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| The 35-foot periphery boundary is already a standard boundary setback in the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4794)|
| 1:20:00| The planning commission does have the ability to reduce this down to 15 feet in certain cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4800)|
| 1:20:06| These conditions provide a buffer from commercial activity along Kingston Pike to the north and maintain a forest buffer along the Hanna Place neighborhood to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4806)|
| 1:20:16| The area of no disturbance in condition number two is about 1.4 acres which is slightly less than the 1.72 acres that should be left undisturbed according to the slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4816)|
| 1:20:27| Condition number two is not an additional non-disturbance area to condition one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4827)|
| 1:20:32| It just indicates where that non-disturbance could be focused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| This rezoning with the noted conditions is consistent with the Comprehensive Plan's Implementation Policy 7 to encourage development practices that conserve and connect natural features and habitat and more specifically with Policy 7.6 to consider the hillside and ridgetop protection plan and land use decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4837)|
| 1:20:57| I will be submitting a blue sheet with a revised slope analysis for this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4857)|
| 1:21:01| This is new information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| The model used to generate the slope analysis in this case apparently grabbed some area outside of the case boundary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4864)|
| 1:21:11| It did not impact the disturbance budget recommendation, but it did provide for a larger total area of the lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4871)|
| 1:21:23| These conditions are not changed, but I will be submitting a revised slope analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4883)|
| 1:21:29| Happy to answer any questions on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4889)|
| 1:21:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| I guess, I don't know that this is a question more of a comment or a concern because I guess I've noticed this over the last few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4896)|
| 1:21:46| I seem to remember some of the properties out on Chapman Highway and some of these ones we've been looking at with respect to the hillside and ridgetop protection plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4906)|
| 1:21:56| I guess where I'm a little confused, it seems like on some of the applications, and I even went down through what's here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4916)|
| 1:22:06| sometimes it looks like we're trying to apply the hillside and ridgetop, which is, it's just recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4926)|
| 1:22:16| It's not enforceable in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4936)|
| 1:22:19| It is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| I'm confused about that, I guess, so I have a bit of a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4940)|
| 1:22:24| But even then, I don't know that it would be being done consistently because, again, just throwing this out, and we can talk more about it Thursday, certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4944)|
| 1:22:36| There's one on Ball Camp that has some hillside on it, but there's no mention of conditions with respect to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4956)|
| 1:22:46| But then there's another one on Maryville Pike that had the analysis and there's a mention of a condition with the hillside on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4966)|
| 1:22:54| As far as I can tell and understand, all the hillside is just recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4974)|
| 1:22:58| It's not to be enforced, necessarily, through conditions or things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4978)|
| 1:23:05| So I just wanted to mention that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4985)|
| 1:23:09| I think a lot of this is going to be taken up again when we get to the UDO.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4989)|
| 1:23:13| Logan and I have had some discussions about that in the past, and I'm okay with continuing to discuss it and see where it lands when the UDO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=4993)|
| 1:23:21| but I would just be very cautious of trying to, from a staff level, to implement the hillside and ridgetop protection at that level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5001)|
| 1:23:34| Just a concern and a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5014)|
| 1:23:36| If I could just provide a couple of comments regarding that, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5016)|
| 1:23:40| Yes, you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5020)|
| 1:23:41| We don't necessarily apply those recommendations for conditions on each property, but as you all know, we look at each property individually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5021)|
| 1:23:49| so there's unique characteristics of each site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5029)|
| 1:23:53| Sometimes it makes more sense than others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5033)|
| 1:23:55| We do and have historically used the hillside and ridgetop plan as a guide for our recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5035)|
| 1:24:02| We've used it to base density off of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5042)|
| 1:24:05| And yes, we can go back and look and see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5045)|
| 1:24:09| I'm sure there's been a number of cases where we have made recommendations to you all to add a condition that was informed by the hillside and ridgetop plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5049)|
| 1:24:19| But you are correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| It is not codified in the zoning ordinance as it is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| I just wanted to provide that additional information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5064)|
| 1:24:27| It does mean, though, that we have, as planning commissioners, if a case comes through, not talking about this one in particular, but if a case comes through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5067)|
| 1:24:35| and we've gotten some guidance about that, whether it's the direct recommendation of what the hillside equation would be or something akin to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5075)|
| 1:24:43| that we have the ability to add that as this needs to be included with this case as that goes on to be recommended to commission, county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5083)|
| 1:24:54| And then they can do with that as they will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5094)|
| 1:24:56| But that's part of our job is to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5096)|
| 1:25:00| And if we feel like it can really make that the best thing that it can be to include that and send that forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5100)|
| 1:25:07| Correct. Yes. Ultimately, it's county commission's decision of whether or not they want to add a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5107)|
| 1:25:12| But the code does not prohibit conditions related to the site in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5112)|
| 1:25:18| So, yeah. And please don't anybody take this as an attack on staff or any because that's not it's absolutely not what I'm doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5118)|
| 1:25:25| I'm just saying the application of it, you know, start, you know, can be construed as capricious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5125)|
| 1:25:32| Yeah. You know, you know, if we look at it, I know that's it's it's in the judgment of everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5132)|
| 1:25:37| I just want to be very careful with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5137)|
| 1:25:47| Item number nine. So this is a request to rezone from neighborhood commercial to industrial mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5147)|
| 1:25:54| which requires a plan amendment from general commercial and neighborhood commercial to light industrial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5154)|
| 1:26:00| This subject property is a one acre parcel near and steep drive near its east and steep drive near its intersection with Central Avenue Pike in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5160)|
| 1:26:10| Sorry, and skip. As you can see in the zoning layer, this parcel is part of a cohesive commercial node at the edge of a single family residential zoning district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5170)|
| 1:26:24| The parcel has split land uses, but they are compatible and consistent with the transition from residential to commercial activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5184)|
| 1:26:31| The property is adjacent to a mixed use special district stemming from the end skip small area plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5191)|
| 1:26:36| And the plan calls for limiting land uses along that section of the corridor to offices and low to medium density residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5196)|
| 1:26:45| That recommendation in the small area plan is consistent with existing land uses along the east and skip drive where the subject property abuts a small scale apartment building and is across the street from single family residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5205)|
| 1:26:58| In the aerial map, you can see some of the changing conditions in the area include get my pointer here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5218)|
| 1:27:06| Include a large multifamily residential development to the southeast. So KCDC development in skip elementary was significantly expanded in 2019 right here, almost doubling in size to provide more classrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5226)|
| 1:27:20| There's also an office warehouse that was developed within the past year on a general industrial zone parcel. It's part of kind of a legacy industrial area there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5240)|
| 1:27:34| There is a saturation of legacy industrial zoning in the end skip neighborhood, especially along the rail lines, much of which utilizes substandard local streets for heavy and trucking traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5254)|
| 1:27:45| Adding more industrial zoning to this neighborhood is one of the in one of the few locations where there is an active neighborhood commercial node could be inappropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5265)|
| 1:27:56| Staff are recommending denial of the IMU district and the light industrial land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5276)|
| 1:28:02| It does not meet any of the criteria for plan amendments in terms of changing conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5282)|
| 1:28:08| The increase in residential development and school expansion don't support more industrial zoning in close proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5288)|
| 1:28:15| The warehouse recently built on industrial zone property also reflects the trend towards lighter uses, even in legacy industrial areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5295)|
| 1:28:23| With regards to IMU zoning, the subject property is surrounded by service oriented commercial and residential uses on all sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5303)|
| 1:28:31| There is a restaurant and a new beauty supply store directly across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5311)|
| 1:28:35| While the IMU district does permit uses that are compatible with surrounding development, it also permits industrial uses that would be incompatible with neighborhood commercial and residential activity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5315)|
| 1:28:47| Additionally, the subject lot is not a historically industrial property, which is the intended context for IMU.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5327)|
| 1:28:54| This location is also served by a relatively narrow and congested collector street where the potential for trucking traffic could have an adverse impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5334)|
| 1:29:02| Happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5342)|
| 1:29:13| We'll move on to agenda items 12 and 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| These two rezoning cases are being merged because the reports are similar and they're in close proximity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5357)|
| 1:29:23| The properties are 1214 and 1224 Calloway Street in the Mechanicsville neighborhood, and the request is to rezone from the RN2 to the RN4 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5363)|
| 1:29:33| In the zoning map, you can see these parcels are located on either side of an RN4 zone property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5373)|
| 1:29:39| The middle property was rezoned from RN2 to RN4 last year per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5379)|
| 1:29:45| The case was 7H23RZ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| Yet there are several aspects of that property that differ from these cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5388)|
| 1:29:51| The middle property is more than double in size and width than the subject properties with an area of over 10,000 square feet and a width of 75 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5391)|
| 1:30:00| It meets the dimensional standards for a variety of housing forms under the RN4 district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5400)|
| 1:30:04| By contrast, the subject properties for 8F has an area of 4,046 square feet and a width of 30 feet, and the property for 8E has an area of 3,371 square feet and a width of 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5404)|
| 1:30:22| These properties do not meet the dimensional standards for any of the housing forms typically permitted in the RN4 zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5422)|
| 1:30:28| These properties are considered non-conforming lots of record per Article 17.3 of the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5428)|
| 1:30:35| and this prevents development that does not meet the minimum lot size and or width standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5435)|
| 1:30:42| Another distinction between the prior RN4 rezoning recommendation and these cases is we now have the middle housing standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5442)|
| 1:30:51| which permit a wider range of house-scale multifamily developments for properties within the traditional neighborhood residential land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5451)|
| 1:31:00| As you can see, the subject properties qualify for middle housing because they have the TDR land use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5460)|
| 1:31:05| so more intensive development than what is standard for RN2 zoning could be pursued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5465)|
| 1:31:11| The applicant is already utilizing the middle housing standards for these properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5471)|
| 1:31:16| On the 1214 lot, the Board of Zoning Appeals recently approved the applicant's variance request to increase the allowed building depth from 50 feet to 65 feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5476)|
| 1:31:26| to permit the conversion of the lot's existing single-family house into a side-by-side duplex running from the front to the rear of the lot under the middle housing criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5486)|
| 1:31:37| Another significant distinction between the RN2 and the RN4 districts is that RN4 permits more than one primary use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5497)|
| 1:31:44| while staff consider all potential uses in a rezoning case instead of specific development proposals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5504)|
| 1:31:52| it is noteworthy that the applicant is already inquiring about building a second duplex in the rear of this lot under RN4 zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5512)|
| 1:32:00| and you can see that with the kind of question mark box in the rear there, and that's from the BZA application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5520)|
| 1:32:08| So there is already non-conforming development potential that exists under RN2 zoning on these lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5528)|
| 1:32:16| Staff do not recommend a rezoning that would increase non-conforming development potential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5536)|
| 1:32:22| as it could result in development that's grossly more intensive than what's intended by the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5542)|
| 1:32:27| Mechanicsville is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| and the subject properties are part of an area that is included in the National Register of Historic Places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5551)|
| 1:32:37| To continue to up-zone these lots could lead to development that diminishes the character of this neighborhood's Victorian and early 20th century shotgun houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5557)|
| 1:32:47| and potentially risks this historic designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| So for these reasons we recommend denial of the RN4 district for both lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5570)|
| 1:32:54| I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5574)|
| 1:32:56| Questions? Okay, seeing no questions, we'll move on to agenda item number 32.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5576)|
| 1:33:05| This is a rezoning and plan amendment case in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5585)|
| 1:33:08| It's a 3.89 acre parcel accessing Freeway Heights Drive, which connects Norris Freeway to the east and Gordon Smith Road to the west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5588)|
| 1:33:17| The request is to rezone from agricultural to CB business and manufacturing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5597)|
| 1:33:22| and to amend the place type from suburban mixed residential to corridor commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5602)|
| 1:33:27| The hillside protection area would be retained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5607)|
| 1:33:31| The applicant's basis for a place type amendment to corridor commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| was that the current suburban mixed residential place type is an error| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5616)|
| 1:33:41| because this property abuts Tyndall's building supply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| which is a long-standing heavy commercial and industrial facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5625)|
| 1:33:48| And that it has direct access to Norris Freeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5628)|
| 1:33:52| Staff have determined that the SMR place type is not the result of an error or omission in the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5632)|
| 1:33:58| This place type is consistent with the existing residential land use of the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| and it's part of a cohesive cluster of SMR designated properties that are residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5643)|
| 1:34:09| The requested corridor commercial place type does not correspond to the existing residential land use of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5649)|
| 1:34:15| The requested corridor commercial place type does not currently exist in this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5655)|
| 1:34:20| and the subject property's location does not align with the intent of the place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5660)|
| 1:34:25| Specifically, the comprehensive plan describes the CC designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5665)|
| 1:34:29| as being situated along major transportation corridors and appropriate for uses such as shopping centers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5669)|
| 1:34:35| This property's legal access is not directly onto Norris Freeway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| but rather is a narrow unstriped easement leading to a 15-foot wide unstriped local street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5678)|
| 1:34:45| that primarily services single-family residences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5685)|
| 1:34:50| The zoning ordinance describes how the CB zone is intended for a wide range of business and manufacturing uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5690)|
| 1:34:56| The nature of such businesses is to attract large volumes of automobile and truck traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5696)|
| 1:35:01| and to have adverse effects on surrounding properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5701)|
| 1:35:04| The zoning description states that CB is incompatible with residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5704)|
| 1:35:09| or other uses that require an environment free of noise, odors, and congestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5709)|
| 1:35:14| The requested CB zoning could have numerous negative impacts on the surrounding residential properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5714)|
| 1:35:20| Heavy trucking traffic and the potentially noxious impacts of manufacturing uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5720)|
| 1:35:25| could affect quality of life of surrounding residents and residential property values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| The only notable change of conditions that has occurred in the past few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5730)|
| 1:35:35| is a surface parking lot that was constructed two years ago without permits next to the subject property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5735)|
| 1:35:41| It cleared over an acre of forest that provided a vegetative buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| between this heavy commercial activity and residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5744)|
| 1:35:48| The proposed rezoning would further erode that protective boundary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5748)|
| 1:35:51| and is not appropriate at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5751)|
| 1:35:54| It's also noteworthy that the adjacent property that is now a surface parking lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5754)|
| 1:35:59| was the subject of a rezoning request to the CB zone as well back in 1999| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5759)|
| 1:36:05| and this was denied because of its proximity to residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5765)|
| 1:36:11| Staff are recommending denial of the CB zone and the CC place type at this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5771)|
| 1:36:16| The subject property abuts five occupied residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5776)|
| 1:36:20| and is next to a condominium with 24 townhouse units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| The surrounding residential context paired with the substandard road access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5783)|
| 1:36:26| conflicts with the intent of the CB district as described in the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5786)|
| 1:36:31| and the CC place type in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5791)|
| 1:36:34| While specific development proposals are not typically within the scope of a rezoning review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5794)|
| 1:36:38| the applicant has shared an intention to connect the subject property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5798)|
| 1:36:42| to the existing commercial properties to the southwest and the northwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5802)|
| 1:36:48| Creating access to either adjacent lot would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| grading into previously undisturbed slopes that generally exceed 40%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5813)|
| 1:36:58| and if such access was created, it would redirect traffic to Gordon Smith Road, a minor collector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5818)|
| 1:37:04| However, these are not the current conditions of the site or the legal conditions of the site yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5824)|
| 1:37:09| If new access was constructed, it would clear portions of this dense vegetative buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5829)|
| 1:37:14| between districts and intensities of land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5834)|
| 1:37:16| and would result in more intensive commercial uses encroaching into a residential area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5836)|
| 1:37:22| So for these reasons, we're recommending denial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5842)|
| 1:37:25| I'm happy to answer any questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5845)|
| 1:37:33| Okay, we will move to the last one on our agenda, which is number 46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5853)|
| 1:37:38| All right, rapid fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| This is a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| It's actually a revision to a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| This indoor pickleball facility was approved last year in the agricultural zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5865)|
| 1:37:53| with case number 5D23UR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5873)|
| 1:37:56| The applicant is requesting to remove the landscape buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| between the parking lot of the new facility and the adjacent residential property to the east.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5879)|
| 1:38:04| The original plan provides a landscape screen along the eastern lot line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5884)|
| 1:38:09| containing two offset rows of 26 American holly trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5889)|
| 1:38:12| and 26 eastern red cedar trees, as you can see at the top there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5892)|
| 1:38:20| The applicant is requesting to remove all but 12 of the eastern red cedar trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5900)|
| 1:38:24| and cluster them closer to the front lot line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5904)|
| 1:38:26| The reason provided is that the slope, which was created by the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| and consistent with the original plan, is too steep for the trees to be viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5910)|
| 1:38:35| The steepness of the constructed slope was known when the landscaping was proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5915)|
| 1:38:41| and the grade of the slope did not change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5921)|
| 1:38:44| The applicant has provided an alternative plan to install a 6-foot tall wooden privacy fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5924)|
| 1:38:49| along the eastern lot line in place of vegetation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5929)|
| 1:38:52| but they would prefer to only install the 12 trees in the revised landscaping plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| A UT extension agent with the Natural Resources Division| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| joined planning staff for a site visit and determined that the slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5941)|
| 1:39:05| is not too steep to plant as originally intended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5945)|
| 1:39:09| The extension agent is an ISA certified arborist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| and took three soil core samples at varying levels of the slope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5953)|
| 1:39:17| He found that there is enough soil depth for the newly planted trees to take root| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5957)|
| 1:39:23| and he provided guidance on planting slopes with up to a 50% grade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5963)|
| 1:39:28| which is the max steepness of the subject property slope, according to the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5968)|
| 1:39:33| This determination and guidance includes the recommendation to plant native grasses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5973)|
| 1:39:39| that do not require mowing instead of fescue grass,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| and that can be found in your package as Exhibit B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5982)|
| 1:39:47| The native tree buffer serves several functions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5987)|
| 1:39:50| It provides a visual screen between the pickleball building and parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5990)|
| 1:39:54| which will be illuminated at night, and the single family dwelling adjacent to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| It also provides modest native reforestation on a wooded lot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=5998)|
| 1:40:02| that is cleared by approximately 40% for the pickleball development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6002)|
| 1:40:06| This replanting complies with the adopted East County Community Plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6006)|
| 1:40:10| which lists forested areas and native landscaping as defining features| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6010)|
| 1:40:15| of the rural character that the plan strives to preserve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6015)|
| 1:40:18| It would be inconsistent with this plan to remove 40 trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6018)|
| 1:40:22| when it's been determined that they're viable on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| The comprehensive plan has several implementation policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6025)|
| 1:40:28| that are incompatible with the proposed tree removal as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| They include Policy 2 to ensure that development is sensitive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6030)|
| 1:40:34| to existing community character, and Policy 7 to encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6034)|
| 1:40:38| development practices that conserve and connect natural features and habitat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6038)|
| 1:40:44| This section of the Strawberry Plains Pike Corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6044)|
| 1:40:47| is characterized by significant forest coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6047)|
| 1:40:50| The original planting plan increased compatibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6050)|
| 1:40:53| of the pickleball facility with the area in this context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6053)|
| 1:40:56| The applicant has provided a letter from the adjacent property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6056)|
| 1:40:58| to the east at 7737 Strawberry Plains Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6058)|
| 1:41:02| It states that she approves of the revised landscaping plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6062)|
| 1:41:05| and does not desire a buffer between the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6065)|
| 1:41:08| However, it's noteworthy that this person sold the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6068)|
| 1:41:11| where the pickleball facility is now being developed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6071)|
| 1:41:14| and also recently sold the two-acre lot east of the 7737 property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6074)|
| 1:41:18| which has been cleared for a single-family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| The property at 7737 was additionally advertised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6081)|
| 1:41:24| as being for sale by the owner not long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| The construction of the recreational facility is still underway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| and the parking lot and subsequent lighting have not been installed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| so it's not known at this point what the full impacts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| of the development will be on the surrounding area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6094)|
| 1:41:37| The vegetative buffer provides protection for this use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6097)|
| 1:41:41| which is an outlier among the agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6101)|
| 1:41:44| and rural residential uses along this section of the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6104)|
| 1:41:50| For the reasons described, staff are recommending denial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6110)|
| 1:41:52| of the revision request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6112)|
| 1:41:54| Primary among those reasons are the feasibility determination| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| by a certified professional and the revisions incompatibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6117)|
| 1:42:01| with adopted plans and policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6121)|
| 1:42:08| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6128)|
| 1:42:10| Any other items?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| I have a question about 38, and I'm sorry to everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| to extend the meeting just a little bit longer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6135)|
| 1:42:17| but maybe I'm not the only person with this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6137)|
| 1:42:20| It's not as much about the case in particular,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6140)|
| 1:42:23| but this case raised the question for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6143)|
| 1:42:27| And it's the cases bringing into play the new plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6147)|
| 1:42:35| so it's a new place type, and it's the rural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6155)|
| 1:42:40| it's hard for me to say that word, rural commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6160)|
| 1:42:45| And my question is how Planning Commission is supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6165)|
| 1:42:50| to interpret this, because there's zero commercial anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6170)|
| 1:42:56| around the property in question, but it is a rezoning request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6176)|
| 1:43:02| and it is identified, if I understand correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6182)|
| 1:43:06| it's identified in the growth area as a rural,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6186)|
| 1:43:12| as a commercial zone or node potential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6192)|
| 1:43:16| And I'm just trying to understand how we're supposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6196)|
| 1:43:19| to consider, the plan is saying this is an acceptable sort| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6199)|
| 1:43:25| of thing to do, but there's nothing in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| that fits that right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6208)|
| 1:43:32| I'll have to, let me orient myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6212)|
| 1:43:35| Yeah, I'm sorry, I'm kind of throwing it out of left field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6215)|
| 1:43:38| It is Kelsey's case too, so while I'm looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6218)|
| 1:43:39| Kelsey, if you have anything to add, feel free to jump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6219)|
| 1:43:43| And like I said, it's not as much about this specific case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| as it is to know how we're supposed to be using| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6227)|
| 1:43:50| this new plan when we're encountering places| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6230)|
| 1:43:53| that don't have that commercial existence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6233)|
| 1:43:57| or residential existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| It could be anything, but it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6239)|
| 1:44:01| Well, the rural crossroads commercial place type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6241)|
| 1:44:05| was developed specifically for more rural areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6245)|
| 1:44:07| where there's not a lot of commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6247)|
| 1:44:09| So identifying nodes where it might be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6249)|
| 1:44:12| for small scale residentials to serve more rural places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6252)|
| 1:44:17| And so the zone that's being requested does align| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6257)|
| 1:44:22| with that place type and that intent of that place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6262)|
| 1:44:25| I'm not sure if I'm answering your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6265)|
| 1:44:27| but again, yeah, it is a new place type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6267)|
| 1:44:30| but I wouldn't say that what's being requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6270)|
| 1:44:34| is unusual because there is no commercial around it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6274)|
| 1:44:38| I don't think that we want to see a proliferation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6278)|
| 1:44:40| of commercial in these more rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6280)|
| 1:44:43| That was the intent behind the rural crossroads commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| is to allow commercial to be placed in these communities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| but not to have strip malls and a lot of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6290)|
| 1:44:53| That makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6293)|
| 1:44:55| Sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6295)|
| 1:44:57| I may have more questions on Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6297)|
| 1:44:59| but the impetus is just to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6299)|
| 1:45:01| how to apply the new plan in these types of circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6301)|
| 1:45:05| Not this case specifically, but kind of in general.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6305)|
| 1:45:08| So I can follow up with you and Kelsey afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6308)|
| 1:45:12| One quick thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6312)|
| 1:45:14| I noticed on the map there's 8A24SU on State Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6314)|
| 1:45:18| but I didn't see that in our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6318)|
| 1:45:21| Is that, maybe it is on the agenda, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6321)|
| 1:45:26| It was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6326)|
| 1:45:28| It was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6328)|
| 1:45:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6329)|
| 1:45:31| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240806-agenda-review?start=6331)|
