| 2:38:52| I would assume that's where the route's going to be, would be part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9532)|
| 2:38:55| Assuming that, I don't know that, but I'm going to say that it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9535)|
| 2:39:00| Fort Sanders, I mean, those are people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9540)|
| 2:39:03| They're not, you know, so I want to see if we can just find common ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9543)|
| 2:39:08| So there's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9548)|
| 2:39:10| There's a motion and a second to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9550)|
| 2:39:11| Let's see if we have any comments on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9551)|
| 2:39:14| Well, I'm going to support the motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9554)|
| 2:39:17| I guess my concern, I'm a little frustrated tonight, as some of you probably are beginning to guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9557)|
| 2:39:22| because CAT knew and the university knew several months ago that this was an issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9562)|
| 2:39:29| and to wait until less than 30 days before these shelters need to be removed to bring it to council is just not good form,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9569)|
| 2:39:38| from my perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9578)|
| 2:39:39| I'm not speaking for the other eight members of council, but it's not good form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9579)|
| 2:39:43| And it doesn't give us the opportunity to really ask questions or get to the bottom of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9583)|
| 2:39:49| We just have to assume that everything we're being told is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9589)|
| 2:39:53| And typically in the past, I've gotten in trouble with making assumptions on different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9593)|
| 2:39:59| and this is one of those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9599)|
| 2:40:01| So I want to support Vice Mayor Pavlis's motion to postpone for two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9601)|
| 2:40:06| but I'm not happy with the way this has been handled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9606)|
| 2:40:09| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9609)|
| 2:40:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9610)|
| 2:40:11| I concur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9611)|
| 2:40:13| I would suggest that UT and the city of Knoxville look for maybe the UT would purchase two additional shelters for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9613)|
| 2:40:23| keep the ones you got and buy additional shelters for the city of Knoxville in lieu of picking them up and moving them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9623)|
| 2:40:31| Sort of a trade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9631)|
| 2:40:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9634)|
| 2:40:35| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9635)|
| 2:40:36| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9636)|
| 2:40:37| I'd agree with Councilmember Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9637)|
| 2:40:40| This is quite frustrating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9640)|
| 2:40:41| I think one thing that's frustrating is it seems like it's a battle about if you're for or against shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9641)|
| 2:40:46| I think everybody on this council and the administration, certainly the CAT staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9646)|
| 2:40:51| and the CAT or the KTA board is all in favor of public transportation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9651)|
| 2:40:55| and everybody in this room wants more shelters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9655)|
| 2:40:59| We all know that it makes it more comfortable and it increases ridership and makes people feel safe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9659)|
| 2:41:05| and we're all for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9665)|
| 2:41:07| But it's making us feel like we're voting for or against that, and it's frustrating to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9667)|
| 2:41:12| I certainly have sympathy for the people opposed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9672)|
| 2:41:18| It looks like we're giving it to UT, and we're not getting anything back for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9678)|
| 2:41:23| So I see that argument, but the professionals at CAT say that it doesn't make financial sense to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9683)|
| 2:41:30| It's not the way to get the most number of shelters out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9690)|
| 2:41:33| and I certainly see Councilmember Pavlis's comment that the students at UT are citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9693)|
| 2:41:39| A lot of them are citizens of this city and live in this city and are citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9699)|
| 2:41:44| So we're just, I mean, taking shelters for them to put somewhere else if it doesn't make financial sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9704)|
| 2:41:50| And let's not forget that this was voted on by the KTA board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9710)|
| 2:41:54| I believe there's just one vote, Mr. Smith, against it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9714)|
| 2:41:58| and all those people are advocates for shelters and for public transportation, and they all voted for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9718)|
| 2:42:05| So, you know, I guess we're going to postpone it, but, you know, it's a frustrating situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9725)|
| 2:42:11| But I guess I'll support the motion to postpone, but I just thought I'd get those comments out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9731)|
| 2:42:16| And then in terms of the deadline liability, I'm not sure how much we need to worry about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9736)|
| 2:42:21| if they don't think these shelters are going to fall down and hurt somebody on May 31st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9741)|
| 2:42:27| We could look between then and now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9747)|
| 2:42:29| We could look how many lawsuits or accidents were caused by these shelters in the last couple of years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9749)|
| 2:42:36| to see how big of an issue that is in terms of a deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9756)|
| 2:42:40| But those are just my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9760)|
| 2:42:43| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9763)|
| 2:42:44| Yes, I just want to be known that I did vote along with Mr. Smith at the CAT meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9764)|
| 2:42:50| So there were at least two or three votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9770)|
| 2:42:52| But since that time, I've had time to think about it a little more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9772)|
| 2:42:57| And as I stated previously, first of all, I'm very concerned about anybody and everybody that rides the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9777)|
| 2:43:03| I ride the bus myself sometimes, especially the trolley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9783)|
| 2:43:07| And as you said, it's not about we all would like to have nice facilities for people to wait while they're catching the bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9787)|
| 2:43:17| But I think it would be better to have some new facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9797)|
| 2:43:22| and we have some funds available to purchase them rather than to tear those down and try to move them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9802)|
| 2:43:30| And it has been stated you have students at the University of Tennessee who are people too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9810)|
| 2:43:37| And we need to be concerned about everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9817)|
| 2:43:40| So I'm going to support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9820)|
| 2:43:42| I don't know what a postponement is really going to accomplish because we tend to postpone everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9822)|
| 2:43:49| And we need to go ahead and start voting and make decisions because it's really and I don't know why we want to postpone this really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9829)|
| 2:43:58| And as the representative from council, I'm going to support what's on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9838)|
| 2:44:05| That's my position at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9845)|
| 2:44:07| Mayor, do I get a minute to rebut?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9847)|
| 2:44:08| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9848)|
| 2:44:09| A minute to rebut, may I?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9849)|
| 2:44:11| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9851)|
| 2:44:12| I would give up and reconnect that I hope to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9852)|
| 2:44:15| Go right ahead, Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9855)|
| 2:44:17| Thank you, because as one of your representatives on the KTA board, you see the frustrations that I'm going through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9857)|
| 2:44:23| On the 22nd of last month, we get this one-page, seven- or eight-line resolution to vote on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9863)|
| 2:44:33| Councilwoman Palmer is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9873)|
| 2:44:36| I did not make the motion to postpone for 30 days because I would at least like to lay eyes on the shelters that we're going to give away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9876)|
| 2:44:43| Councilman Brown is correct, sort of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9883)|
| 2:44:45| He seconded my motion to postpone, but he did not vote with me on the main motion, which failed seven to one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9885)|
| 2:44:53| I was the one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9893)|
| 2:44:54| So I want to explain that vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9894)|
| 2:44:56| For the very reasons that you heard tonight, which have not been specific, they've been very unclear about why we're giving away these shelters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9896)|
| 2:45:05| Mr. Herr chimed in and said, no, no, we can't do that for the reason that he gave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9905)|
| 2:45:09| Now, as stated, Mr. Herr is the director of transportation at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9909)|
| 2:45:13| His interests are there to run that new system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9913)|
| 2:45:17| I don't have any divided loyalties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9917)|
| 2:45:19| My loyalties are to the city of Knoxville and our passengers, and this does not help them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9919)|
| 2:45:25| Why should we not give these shelters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9925)|
| 2:45:27| They chose to do business with somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9927)|
| 2:45:29| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9929)|
| 2:45:30| Now, let somebody else buy the shelters and give us the ones that we belong to or that belong to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9930)|
| 2:45:37| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9937)|
| 2:45:38| Vice Mayor Pavlos?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9938)|
| 2:45:39| Well, I think Councilman Brown makes a good point, but let me just clarify why I think it's important to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9939)|
| 2:45:48| Everything that I've heard, I mean, the most compelling arguments is that we're giving away public property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9948)|
| 2:45:55| which this meeting has been full of this evening, it seems like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9955)|
| 2:46:03| That's the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9963)|
| 2:46:05| But I wanted to see if you can't go back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9965)|
| 2:46:08| I mean, if you can go back and strike up some type of an agreement to, you know, to not give this away| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9968)|
| 2:46:15| and whatever the price might be, if it's $1,500, if that's what it costs to uproot them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9975)|
| 2:46:22| I don't think it's good business to uproot them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9982)|
| 2:46:24| They've been there a long time, and I think if you do that, you run the chance of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9984)|
| 2:46:29| of them becoming defective in some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9989)|
| 2:46:32| I'm not a mechanical engineer, but just common sense kind of tells me that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9992)|
| 2:46:36| So everything that I've heard tonight is talking about the money, and we're giving it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=9996)|
| 2:46:40| So perhaps in two weeks' time, I think Councilman Starr makes a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10000)|
| 2:46:45| I probably should have stood by the 28 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10005)|
| 2:46:48| I don't think they're going to fall over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10008)|
| 2:46:49| But that's the motion out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10009)|
| 2:46:51| That's the only reason that I thought that it was probably a good idea to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10011)|
| 2:46:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10018)|
| 2:46:59| So the motion on the table is to postpone this resolution for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10019)|
| 2:47:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10025)|
| 2:47:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10026)|
| 2:47:07| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10027)|
| 2:47:08| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10028)|
| 2:47:10| Is that two noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10030)|
| 2:47:13| Brown and Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10033)|
| 2:47:16| Any other noes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10036)|
| 2:47:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10038)|
| 2:47:19| It passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10039)|
| 2:47:20| The motion to postpone passes 7-2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10040)|
| 2:47:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10044)|
| 2:47:26| 11M, a resolution authorizing the Mayor to execute an agreement with Merritt Construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10046)|

| 2:47:35| for an amount not to exceed $1,174,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10055)|
| 2:47:40| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10060)|
| 2:47:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10061)|
| 2:47:42| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10062)|
| 2:47:44| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10064)|

| 2:47:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10066)|
| 2:47:48| Motion passes and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10068)|
| 2:47:51| 11N, a resolution authorizing the Industrial Development Board of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10071)|
| 2:47:56| to negotiate and accept from Hatcher Hill & Associates payments in lieu of ad valorem taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10076)|
| 2:48:02| with respect to property located at 620 and 626 South Gay Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10082)|
| 2:48:07| and finding that such payments are deemed to be in furtherance of the public purposes of the board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10087)|
| 2:48:13| as defined in Tennessee Code Annotated, Section 753.305.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10093)|
| 2:48:19| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10099)|
| 2:48:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10100)|
| 2:48:22| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10102)|
| 2:48:24| Yes, we have Mr. Wetzel here, and I know he's dying to tell us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10104)|
| 2:48:27| but I understand from reading this that with the pilot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10107)|
| 2:48:31| this might be economically feasible and make their lender sing happy tunes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10111)|
| 2:48:37| to the point of lending them money to do the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10117)|
| 2:48:39| and without it, because of the asbestos removal and other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10119)|
| 2:48:42| the project's probably not going to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10122)|
| 2:48:45| Is that fair or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10125)|
| 2:48:46| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10126)|
| 2:48:47| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10127)|
| 2:48:48| And they asked for a 15-year pilot, but you gave them a 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10128)|
| 2:48:50| We're recommending a 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10130)|
| 2:48:52| You'll see a lot of 10-year recommendations on downtown pilots from us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10132)|
| 2:48:55| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10135)|
| 2:48:56| And the bottom line is we'll put a building back into service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10136)|
| 2:48:58| and eventually it will hit the tax rolls at a higher rate after the 10 years passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10138)|
| 2:49:03| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10143)|
| 2:49:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10144)|
| 2:49:05| For the record, this is the green KUB, the old KUB building, the green building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10145)|
| 2:49:10| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10150)|
| 2:49:11| And it's been there for how many years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10151)|
| 2:49:12| It's been empty for 10 or 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10152)|
| 2:49:13| Thirteen years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10153)|
| 2:49:14| Thirteen years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10154)|
| 2:49:15| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10155)|
| 2:49:16| Councilman Graves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10156)|
| 2:49:17| Yeah, Mr. Wetzel, just for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10157)|
| 2:49:18| would you tell us what they pay now and what they will be paying after the investment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10158)|
| 2:49:25| Same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10165)|
| 2:49:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10166)|
| 2:49:27| Currently, let me start over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10167)|
| 2:49:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10170)|
| 2:49:31| The current tax bill the city is counting together is $11,202,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10171)|
| 2:49:36| and that will be their pilot payment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10176)|
| 2:49:38| It is projected after the project's completion that the value of the profit would lead to $52,000 a year in taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10178)|
| 2:49:45| which is what will come in 10 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10185)|
| 2:49:47| So we'll put those on the list for 10 years from now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10187)|
| 2:49:50| That's city and county together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10190)|
| 2:49:51| City and county together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10191)|
| 2:49:52| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10192)|
| 2:49:53| No, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10193)|
| 2:49:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10194)|
| 2:49:55| Not to talk too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10195)|
| 2:49:56| You know, we have our first project issue at IDB yesterday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10196)|
| 2:49:59| The Starkey Build is our first downtown residential pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10199)|
| 2:50:03| It wraps up at the end of this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10203)|
| 2:50:05| If you go into next year, we've got three more coming off the books,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10205)|
| 2:50:08| so we're starting to cycle into that phase, and it's working very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10208)|
| 2:50:12| Great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10212)|
| 2:50:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10213)|
| 2:50:14| Councilman Starr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10214)|
| 2:50:15| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10215)|
| 2:50:16| I just wanted to add briefly that I don't know if this is considered a blighted property or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10216)|
| 2:50:19| but I have gotten complaints from neighbors that this property is blighted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10219)|
| 2:50:24| There's missing windows and rubble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10224)|
| 2:50:26| So I think it's great that there's a plan to get this back into use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10226)|
| 2:50:30| Yeah, I think we'd all agree this is a blighted property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10230)|
| 2:50:34| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10234)|
| 2:50:37| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10237)|
| 2:50:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10238)|
| 2:50:39| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10239)|
| 2:50:40| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10240)|
| 2:50:43| 12A, an ordinance making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10243)|
| 2:50:45| and fixing the annual appropriations for the several departments, agencies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10245)|
| 2:50:49| and funds of the City of Knoxville for the fiscal period beginning July 1, 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10249)|
| 2:50:55| and ending June 30, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10255)|
| 2:50:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10258)|
| 2:50:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10259)|
| 2:51:00| Councilman Delva.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10260)|
| 2:51:01| I would ask Councilor Frost to tell us about the charter and ordinance that requires us to pass this on first reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10261)|
| 2:51:10| even though we're having our hearings on the 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10270)|
| 2:51:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10274)|
| 2:51:15| Section 901, I believe it's Article Roman Numeral 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10275)|
| 2:51:19| It's whatever I put in the e-mail to you all earlier today that it's required to be passed on first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10279)|
| 2:51:24| Then we'll have our budget hearings a week from today, as Vice Mayor Pavlis mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10284)|
| 2:51:30| So the approval tees up the ability to have the hearings, and we'll pick apart the budget then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10290)|
| 2:51:34| Well, it can be discussed at the budget workshop, and anything can be suggested upon second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10294)|
| 2:51:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10302)|
| 2:51:43| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10303)|
| 2:51:44| Is Tuesday going to be a long day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10304)|
| 2:51:45| I didn't want to see the Mayor faint when I said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10305)|
| 2:51:47| What's this picking apart we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10307)|
| 2:51:50| Maybe analyze it closely would be a better phrase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10310)|
| 2:51:52| And we encourage you to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10312)|
| 2:51:56| Okay, so we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10316)|
| 2:51:58| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10318)|
| 2:51:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10319)|
| 2:52:00| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10320)|
| 2:52:01| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10321)|
| 2:52:02| And so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10322)|
| 2:52:03| 12B, an ordinance to levy a tax on all taxable properties real, personal, and mixed within the corporate limits of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10323)|
| 2:52:11| to provide sufficient revenues to fund the general fund and debt service fund operations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10331)|
| 2:52:15| and debt service obligations of the City of Knoxville for the fiscal period beginning July 1, 2013, and ending June 30, 2014.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10335)|
| 2:52:24| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10344)|
| 2:52:25| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10345)|
| 2:52:26| Councilman Del Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10346)|
| 2:52:28| I don't know if Jim York's there, but, yes, he is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10348)|
| 2:52:30| But, Jim, I understand from this paperwork that when they finally get done with the reappraisal through the county appraisal system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10350)|
| 2:52:40| the tax rate may have to be adjusted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10360)|
| 2:52:42| But we're going forward with the $246 per hundred right now with the notion that we may have to adapt as the numbers come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10362)|
| 2:52:53| Jim York, finance director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10373)|
| 2:52:56| What this ordinance does is adopt a $2.46 tax levy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10376)|
| 2:53:04| Once we get the final numbers from the assessor and have the state certify a tax rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10384)|
| 2:53:12| we will bring back an ordinance that gives you the certified equivalent to $2.46.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10392)|
| 2:53:20| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10400)|
| 2:53:21| The number might change, but it's revenue neutral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10401)|
| 2:53:23| In other words, you match the appraisal with the rate to get the same dollar input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10403)|
| 2:53:28| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10408)|
| 2:53:29| Now, again, I do expect that it will change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10409)|
| 2:53:33| I don't think it's going to change very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10413)|
| 2:53:36| But it will change, and it will be revenue neutral for existing properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10416)|
| 2:53:41| We will be able to add the value for any properties that have come on the roll, new properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10421)|
| 2:53:48| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10428)|
| 2:53:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10430)|
| 2:53:51| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10431)|

| 2:54:13| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10453)|
| 2:54:14| I was just going to say, Vicki has sat through this whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10454)|
| 2:54:16| She might have something to say to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10456)|
| 2:54:18| Like good night or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10458)|
| 2:54:20| Please pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10460)|
| 2:54:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10464)|
| 2:54:25| Unless you have questions for her, she's going to pass on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10465)|
| 2:54:27| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10467)|
| 2:54:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10470)|

| 2:56:58| Mark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10618)|
| 2:56:59| Yes, he's on the ball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10619)|
| 2:57:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10621)|
| 2:57:02| Why are we going?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10622)|
| 2:57:03| I understand that this was a residential use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10623)|
| 2:57:05| and they want to stay with residential as opposed to commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10625)|
| 2:57:08| and that sounds great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10628)|
| 2:57:09| Why are we choosing medium density since it seems to say it's basically a dwelling?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10629)|
| 2:57:14| Why isn't it low density residential is the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10634)|
| 2:57:18| Because the zoning on the property immediately to the west to the east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10638)|
| 2:57:25| is R2 with medium density residential land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10645)|
| 2:57:32| So this property is consistent with the adjacent properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10652)|
| 2:57:37| or the request is consistent with the adjacent properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10657)|
| 2:57:40| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10660)|
| 2:57:41| I was just curious because it says it's a detached dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10661)|
| 2:57:43| That sounds like a single family operation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10663)|
| 2:57:45| We have vast amounts of land within the city that's zoned R2| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10665)|
| 2:57:49| but built with houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10669)|
| 2:57:53| So it's consistency is the theory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10673)|
| 2:57:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10675)|
| 2:57:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10676)|

| 3:01:02| Moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10862)|
| 3:01:03| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10863)|

| 3:01:05| All in favor say, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10865)|
| 3:01:06| We've got to say how long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10866)|
| 3:01:07| Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10867)|
| 3:01:08| It needs 30 days' notice, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10868)|
| 3:01:09| This quite literally could be till August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10869)|
| 3:01:10| We can't get the plan amendment on June, so it'll have to go to July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10870)|
| 3:01:11| Within our normal rhythm, it brings it to the council in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10871)|
| 3:01:22| We have to go to July, which, within our normal rhythm, brings it to the Council in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10882)|
| 3:01:31| Does Mr. Holt have anything to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10891)|
| 3:01:33| Perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10893)|
| 3:01:35| Mr. Seymour?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10895)|
| 3:01:36| What are we today, May 14th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10896)|
| 3:01:38| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10898)|
| 3:01:39| If we could apply or postpone for four Council meetings and, if need be, postpone beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10899)|
| 3:01:46| Okay, postpone for 48 days and bring it back, and then we'll see where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10906)|
| 3:01:49| We may be able to double notice and shorten it by two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10909)|
| 3:01:55| Is that acceptable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10915)|
| 3:01:56| That works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10916)|
| 3:01:57| So the motion is to postpone 48 days on that particular parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10917)|
| 3:02:01| Does that work for the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10921)|
| 3:02:02| Does that sound like it's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10922)|
| 3:02:03| Mr. Holt, is that agreeable?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10923)|
| 3:02:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10925)|

| 3:02:15| Four times 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10935)|
| 3:02:16| Fifty-six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10936)|
| 3:02:17| Okay, it's 56 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10937)|
| 3:02:19| My wife will tell you I just don't do numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10939)|
| 3:02:21| You divide everything by three, don't you, if you can get a third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10941)|
| 3:02:24| Okay, this is to postpone 56 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10944)|
| 3:02:27| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=10947)|

| 3:07:12| some information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11232)|
| 3:07:13| We're told this project is going to be a number of years, not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11233)|
| 3:07:15| really much happening with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11235)|
| 3:07:17| In early 2012, I noticed on a city council agenda that an item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11237)|
| 3:07:20| had been passed allocating funds to CDM Smith to start planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11240)|
| 3:07:24| on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11244)|
| 3:07:25| And so we made a request to the city, and Mr. Hagerman came out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11245)|
| 3:07:28| in, I think, April or March or April of 2012 and addressed Alice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11248)|
| 3:07:33| Bell and gave us an overview of what the project was and some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11253)|
| 3:07:36| of the planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11256)|
| 3:07:37| And so we said, that's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11257)|
| 3:07:39| And we talked about it, and we said, we've got some concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11259)|
| 3:07:41| around what this project of five-landing Washington Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11261)|
| 3:07:46| means to northeast Knox County, what the impacts are on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11266)|
| 3:07:49| Tazewell Pike Corridor area, on the Millertown Pike around the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11269)|
| 3:07:52| Mall, where a 2009 study said there were also some problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11272)|
| 3:07:56| So we said, you know, we had some concerns in this, across| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11276)|
| 3:07:59| the city, county boundaries, transportation planning office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11279)|
| 3:08:02| So we asked for a meeting with Mayor O'Hara and some others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11282)|
| 3:08:06| and we had that meeting May 31st of 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11286)|
| 3:08:09| And since then, we've been waiting for a response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11289)|
| 3:08:12| We brought these issues up, and that was 348 days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11292)|
| 3:08:16| I finally got a response this afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11296)|
| 3:08:20| And so I think I'm expressing a bit of frustration on behalf of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11300)|
| 3:08:25| Alice Bell Springhill, as well as northeast Knox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11305)|
| 3:08:28| It's taking this long to get back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11308)|
| 3:08:31| I know that there has been some work around the environmental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11311)|
| 3:08:34| impact analysis on this project that's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11314)|
| 3:08:38| I've seen a report on historical structures impact and historical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11318)|
| 3:08:44| area impact that's been done by the consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11324)|
| 3:08:47| It's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11327)|
| 3:08:48| They've got a letter that I sent to Mr. Hagerman back in 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11328)|
| 3:08:52| saying, I want to be involved in the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11332)|
| 3:08:54| Please keep me informed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11334)|
| 3:08:55| And besides the one meeting that we had where he came to Alice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11335)|
| 3:08:58| Bell Springhill and we had with you, Mayor O'Hara, I haven't had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11338)|
| 3:09:02| any kind of contact whatsoever until finally getting a full| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11342)|
| 3:09:06| response today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11346)|
| 3:09:08| And I'm listed as an interested party, so is northeast Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11348)|
| 3:09:13| Preservation Association, East Tennessee Preservation Alliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11353)|
| 3:09:17| In the response today, I was told that the state had sent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11357)|
| 3:09:20| copies of this report to all of us, but none of us have received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11360)|
| 3:09:23| that report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11363)|
| 3:09:24| So what I'm here to do today is really just tell you that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11364)|
| 3:09:27| neighborhood associations would like to be involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11367)|
| 3:09:30| We would like to participate in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11370)|
| 3:09:33| We've asked for some documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11373)|
| 3:09:36| I see there's a couple of reports that have been posted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11376)|
| 3:09:39| up on the city website, but there's a lot of stuff that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11379)|
| 3:09:42| not on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11382)|
| 3:09:43| And really, you know, we're paying good money to an outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11383)|
| 3:09:46| consultant to help with the planning here, but not all the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11386)|
| 3:09:49| I's are getting dotted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11389)|
| 3:09:50| Not all the T's are getting crossed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11390)|
| 3:09:52| We're not getting involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11392)|
| 3:09:53| So it's a plea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11393)|
| 3:09:54| It's a frustration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11394)|
| 3:09:55| This is sort of our last venture recourse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11395)|
| 3:09:57| Councilman De La Volta, he's been trying to carry some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11397)|
| 3:10:00| significant water for us over the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11400)|
| 3:10:04| He's had some meetings with the county and around Millartown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11404)|
| 3:10:07| Pike improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11407)|
| 3:10:08| So we've made some improvements there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11408)|
| 3:10:10| But the neighborhood associations would really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11410)|
| 3:10:12| appreciate some more help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11412)|
| 3:10:13| So we're asking tonight that, one, certainly a representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11413)|
| 3:10:16| come to the next Islesdale-Springhill Neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11416)|
| 3:10:18| Association meeting from the city to talk to us about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11418)|
| 3:10:21| Two, we're asking that we get all the project documentation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11421)|
| 3:10:25| out and posted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11425)|
| 3:10:26| There's a number of reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11426)|
| 3:10:28| There's a historical impact report that has been generated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11428)|
| 3:10:32| but that's not available online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11432)|
| 3:10:34| We'd love to see that along with other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11434)|
| 3:10:36| And finally, this city council, I know there will be some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11436)|
| 3:10:39| requests for funding that come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11439)|
| 3:10:41| And this one, look through with a little bit of scrutiny and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11441)|
| 3:10:44| check with us to see if we've been involved because you're our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11444)|
| 3:10:47| only gate to sort of help control that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11447)|
| 3:10:50| And I thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11450)|
| 3:10:52| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11452)|
| 3:10:53| And to this council, we will forward the letter to you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11453)|
| 3:10:57| was sent to Mr. Murphy and the groups today just so you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11457)|
| 3:11:01| In fact, there were, after we met with them, there were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11461)|
| 3:11:04| subsequent, several meetings we did follow up on a lot of their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11464)|
| 3:11:07| requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11467)|
| 3:11:08| And we did fail to get back to them in a timely manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11468)|
| 3:11:11| However, we did include Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11471)|
| 3:11:13| He was in the meetings as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11473)|
| 3:11:15| And so I tried to relay some of that information to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11475)|
| 3:11:18| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11478)|
| 3:11:19| But we did, we hope we addressed the issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11479)|
| 3:11:21| And Mr. Murphy, any other documents that we don't have up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11481)|
| 3:11:25| yet that you would like to see, please, Mr. Hagerman is our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11485)|
| 3:11:28| contact person on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11488)|
| 3:11:31| And we'll do better in the future in keeping you up to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11491)|
| 3:11:33| date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11493)|
| 3:11:34| We have actually been working on all of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11494)|
| 3:11:36| But we didn't, we failed to communicate properly to you on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11496)|
| 3:11:38| that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11498)|
| 3:11:39| And we apologize for that as we did in our letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11499)|
| 3:11:41| But we'll share that letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11501)|
| 3:11:43| Mr. Hagerman, if you would forward that letter to Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11503)|
| 3:11:46| and all of Council just so they are aware of all the issues Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11506)|
| 3:11:49| Murphy raised in our response.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11509)|
| 3:11:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11511)|
| 3:11:52| We look forward to working with you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11512)|
| 3:11:54| Okay, there being no further business, this meeting is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11514)|
| 3:11:56| adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11516)|
| 3:11:57| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilr265130514?start=11517)|
