| 0:01:59| I'm going to make a nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=119)|
| 0:02:01| But I'm going to tell you it's not like we've ever done before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=121)|
| 0:02:04| Every time we come in here, we always ask for a nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| And you tell them who your nomination is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=129)|
| 0:02:10| But I think you ought to tell why you're nominating that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=130)|
| 0:02:13| And I'm going to tell you about ten reasons why I'm nominating a person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=133)|
| 0:02:17| The first one is to be familiar with that person's character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=137)|
| 0:02:20| Be familiar with that person's work ethic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=140)|
| 0:02:24| Work with that person on some other committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| Make sure that that person will represent the commission in a professional manner at the local and state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=147)|

| 0:02:45| Show up at meetings on the state level and be part of the state level's committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=165)|
| 0:02:53| Be prepared for the meetings and be responsible for giving data for that meeting while you're calling it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=173)|
| 0:03:04| Serve on the state level committee, which is a requirement of the chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=184)|
| 0:03:10| And make sure that that person has earned your respect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=190)|
| 0:03:13| And for that, I nominate John Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=193)|

| 0:04:05| I'm kind of overwhelmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=245)|
| 0:04:07| I did not expect this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=247)|

| 0:04:28| So could I make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=268)|

| 0:11:12| for our special session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=672)|
| 0:11:14| And at this time, we'll be appointing members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=674)|
| 0:11:16| to our standing committees, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| include the Cable TV, Finance, Insolvency Board, Legislative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| Affairs, and the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| So Madam Clerk, please read the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=685)|
| 0:11:32| This is consideration of a resolution of the Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=692)|
| 0:11:35| of Knox County, Tennessee appointing commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| to the standing committees of the Knox County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=697)|
| 0:11:40| Standing committees not composed of the entire membership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=700)|
| 0:11:43| of the commission include the Rules Committee and Sovereignty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=703)|
| 0:11:46| Board and the Legislative Affairs Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| This is resolution R-21-9-101-SS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=709)|
| 0:11:59| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| We'll now identify who wants to serve on which committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| As a reminder to all, our commission rules| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=724)|
| 0:12:07| state that no commissioner shall serve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=727)|
| 0:12:09| as chair of more than two standing committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=729)|
| 0:12:12| The chair of commission shall not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=732)|
| 0:12:13| serve as an officer of a standing committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=733)|
| 0:12:16| Standing committees shall only elect the officer positions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=736)|
| 0:12:18| of chair and vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=738)|
| 0:12:20| Any vacancy on a standing committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| that is not composed of the entire membership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=742)|
| 0:12:24| of the commission shall be filled by resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| of the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| So all members of the commission are on the Cable TV| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| and the Finance Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=752)|
| 0:12:33| So we will dispense with appointing those committees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| until time for them to convene and elect officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| So we'll begin then with the Insolvency Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=761)|
| 0:12:46| So the current Insolvency Board is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=766)|
| 0:12:49| composed of Commissioner Busler, Commissioner Biggs, myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=769)|
| 0:12:54| and Commissioner Jay, who would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=774)|
| 0:12:58| interested in serving on the Insolvency Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=778)|
| 0:13:02| Everybody show of hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=782)|
| 0:13:04| If anyone else is here, Commissioner Jay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| would like to continue on that committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| Commissioner Busler, would you like to continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=789)|

| 0:13:18| Commissioner Biggs as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=798)|
| 0:13:23| Anyone else wish to take the place of the chair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=803)|
| 0:13:31| It meets Commissioner White.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| Commissioner Jay is really good at volunteering people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| so I may look to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=814)|
| 0:13:37| Commissioner Daly, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=817)|

| 0:36:49| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2209)|
| 0:36:52| There are four members of the Commission on the Joint Education Committee currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| That is Commissioner Lundy, Commissioner Durrett, Commissioner Beeler, and Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2216)|
| 0:37:07| Let me just ask it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2227)|
| 0:37:08| Are there any commissioners that would like to serve who have not served on the Joint Education Committee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2228)|
| 0:37:16| If there are, I'll open up the slot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2236)|
| 0:37:20| Commissioner Daly is willing to give his slot to anyone who would like to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2240)|
| 0:37:24| I would simply say I've served on this committee for two years and it's a very good committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2244)|
| 0:37:29| and a good experience for anybody who'd like to serve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| Hint, hint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2252)|
| 0:37:33| Commissioner Hill, would you want to serve on it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2253)|
| 0:37:36| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| I've also served on that committee in my prior role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| I would like to make a nomination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2263)|
| 0:37:45| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2265)|
| 0:37:46| I've often, the best way to learn, as you said, is to serve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2266)|
| 0:37:49| and I've often heard Commissioner Ward say that was his area, perhaps, of least expertise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2269)|
| 0:37:58| so I'd like to nominate Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2278)|
| 0:38:01| I'll have to respectfully decline for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2281)|
| 0:38:03| Next year, maybe, not this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| I'm going to look to Commissioners Lundy and Durrett and Jay and ask if you would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2287)|
| 0:38:14| Actually, you're not on the committee, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| Would you like to serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2296)|
| 0:38:17| No, I chaired it for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| When we reformed it, and I would like to offer that opportunity to someone else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2304)|
| 0:38:25| I want to continue serving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| I'll stay on it in case, so would that make three or four?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2307)|
| 0:38:30| That would make three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| I suppose, I'll nominate Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2315)|
| 0:38:39| Commissioner Smith, would you serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2319)|
| 0:38:45| Outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2325)|

| 0:39:12| Madam Clerk, would you like to read the resolution with the names?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-210901-reorganization?start=2352)|
