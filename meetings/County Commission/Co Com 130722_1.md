| 2:50:21| meeting did it did a great job but it was again more on on how we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10221)|
| 2:50:28| bring things forward how we're going to present things to to to either body I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10228)|
| 2:50:33| think what we ended up deciding is that you know our meeting is kind of kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10233)|
| 2:50:39| conducive for that we meet the first Thursday in each month with the exception| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10239)|
| 2:50:44| of this one we're going to meet on the 8th this time because of a conflict so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10244)|
| 2:50:48| we're going to meet on August the 8th at 430 in the Andrew Johnson building but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10248)|
| 2:50:54| generally speaking we will present the the results of the meeting at this at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10254)|
| 2:51:02| this and and allow for questions there'll be an executive summary that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10262)|
| 2:51:07| will go out and if you have comments on that you'll please just send them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10267)|
| 2:51:15| to our facilitator and not not to the whole body what we don't want to get in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10275)|
| 2:51:19| is a vetting process on the email that that would be potentially deemed non| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10279)|
| 2:51:28| sunshine process deliberation so that's I don't I don't know of anything other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10288)|
| 2:51:33| substantial that we talked about Commissioner Wright Thank You Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10293)|
| 2:51:38| McKenzie Thank You mr. chairman building on that last sentence you had there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10298)|
| 2:51:42| about sunshine there was a question that and I have given it to the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10302)|
| 2:51:48| director to respond to and that it was thought that this small joint committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10308)|
| 2:51:58| of the Board of Education and Commission for and for that that paths would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10318)|
| 2:52:10| built or friendships or ways of communicating and I believe the words| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10330)|
| 2:52:15| that were used was be able to talk to that Commissioner at any point in time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10335)|
| 2:52:20| about what might be going on between Commission and the Board of Education a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10340)|
| 2:52:28| couple of Board of Education people spoke to that particular circumstance of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10348)|
| 2:52:35| being able to build a dialogue of Board of Education members and and Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10355)|
| 2:52:42| members F as that was being discussed I believe I brought it to the table saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10362)|
| 2:52:51| that might be okay you can talk to any other Commissioner except me and at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10371)|
| 2:53:00| same time I don't know whether I said it or not but the implication being is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10380)|
| 2:53:04| I could talk to my Board of Education member Mike McMillan at any time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10384)|
| 2:53:12| because that's the way it's been but this joint committee being established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10392)|
| 2:53:19| by Commission and the Board of Education that committee that four of us are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10399)|
| 2:53:28| members of and they have four members of it can only speak at sunshine or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10408)|
| 2:53:40| noticed publicly noticed meetings was my concern at the small committee meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10420)|
| 2:53:46| I sort of turned and looked at the law office person representing the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10426)|
| 2:53:52| director that was there I sort of looked over my shoulder and he says I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10432)|
| 2:53:59| think I've got this right he said I didn't say that but it sounds like a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10439)|
| 2:54:04| novel idea I'm here this evening seeking further guidance about I know that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10444)|
| 2:54:15| four members of Commission that are there can talk to each other there but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10455)|
| 2:54:18| we can't talk outside that noticed meeting and I would assume I used to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10458)|
| 2:54:28| could go to a school board meeting and talk to Board of Education members but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10468)|
| 2:54:32| I've got four that I can't talk to right now on an unsunshined meeting because of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10472)|
| 2:54:43| us being joint committee members so throw that out there for the law| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10483)|
| 2:54:49| director to respond to thank you Mr. Chairman well Commissioner Wright got it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10489)|
| 2:54:59| right anytime you have a committee whereby it is sunshine those members on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10499)|
| 2:55:06| that committee are constrained to the sunshine anytime they communicate when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10506)|
| 2:55:15| you are an advisory body to a deliberative body which in this case you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10515)|
| 2:55:20| are then you must be sunshine for all of your communications to the public I knew| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10520)|
| 2:55:26| this would probably give everybody heartburn so the open records people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10526)|
| 2:55:31| have been contacted on this behalf too and they affirm that position so we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10531)|
| 2:55:39| where we are with the Open Records Act they can you all can speak to anybody| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10539)|
| 2:55:45| outside that committee other than Commissioner Commissioner and school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10545)|
| 2:55:47| board to school board but you cannot communicate outside the sunshine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10547)|
| 2:55:52| anything related to each other's discussions or what may become a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10552)|
| 2:55:57| discussion you know how the rule goes and so that's really where you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10557)|
| 2:56:01| because it is a committee that is advisory to deliberative bodies and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10561)|
| 2:56:06| that's the rule I got and that's kind of what we even the law department we when| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10566)|
| 2:56:11| we analyze it the first time we said woo and then we got the opinion to it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10571)|
| 2:56:16| what it is thank you Mr. Mr. law director I think that it that particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10576)|
| 2:56:24| meeting I may have referenced or we could have referenced being members of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10584)|
| 2:56:32| the Charter Review Committee we could not speak to other members of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10592)|
| 2:56:35| Charter Review Committee or specifically to me or to Amy we cannot speak to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10595)|
| 2:56:43| two citizen members of the Audit Committee without those meetings being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10603)|
| 2:56:49| sunshine so I thought I appreciate you saying I may have had it semi right my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10609)|
| 2:56:57| mama made me right by definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10617)|
| 2:57:03| that's right this rule this rules oh yeah that was a good discussion and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10623)|
| 2:57:14| still planning to check with CTAS I think Mike was going to check with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10634)|
| 2:57:21| an attorney in Nashville as well because we wonder if the difference being that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10641)|
| 2:57:29| this is not a voting body that it might make a difference because otherwise and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10649)|
| 2:57:33| this is one of the comments that one of the school board members make why are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10653)|
| 2:57:37| we there if we can't talk to each other outside of meetings it kind of defeats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10657)|
| 2:57:41| the whole purpose for the committee so I mean that's that's that's what I took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10661)|
| 2:57:49| away from it from that meeting Mr. McKenzie oh you know and I guess I do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10669)|
| 2:57:55| mean to put a pretty fine point on this and that's you know this committee we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10675)|
| 2:58:02| developed a few things that we're going to talk about and we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10682)|
| 2:58:06| potentially expand that list and and and and what I think but it will be expanded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10686)|
| 2:58:13| in a defined fashion I mean we're not going to just you know talk about what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10693)|
| 2:58:18| the next school's being built and this and that we're going to talk about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10698)|
| 2:58:22| things that you know where where we may not see eye to eye on so there will be a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10702)|
| 2:58:31| defined number of things that we'll talk about so my question is what the school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10711)|
| 2:58:37| board members want and what I want is to build a relationship on things education| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10717)|
| 2:58:44| in general so I think what I heard you say if we're not talking about things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10724)|
| 2:58:48| that are before us or that will come before us we can talk about affairs you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10728)|
| 2:58:54| know because I look at it like this my my first district person is on there so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10734)|
| 2:59:00| if there's an issue with a teacher administrator building I'm probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10740)|
| 2:59:05| gonna you know reach out to her if I get a call saying you know there's a roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10745)|
| 2:59:08| leak it at Sarah Moore Green I'm going to call Gloria so and that's not an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10748)|
| 2:59:14| issue that's going to come before this education committee so I guess my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10754)|
| 2:59:17| questions last concern is is this limited to things that are before or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10757)|
| 2:59:24| that will come before the Education Committee the Open Records Act and as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10764)|
| 2:59:31| well as Fancelor's opinion to us is that if it is as a possibility to come before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10771)|
| 2:59:37| the committee if it's a topic that might come before the committee if it is one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10777)|
| 2:59:41| that will come before the committee then it has to be sunshine okay any other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom130722?start=10781)|
