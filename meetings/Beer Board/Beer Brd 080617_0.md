| 0:00:30| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=30)|
| 0:00:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=35)|
| 0:00:36| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=36)|

| 0:00:43| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=43)|
| 0:00:47| They have not been in for processing, so I...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=47)|
| 0:00:50| Can I make a comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=50)|
| 0:00:51| Yes, you certainly may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=51)|
| 0:00:54| Make the motion I was about to make, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=54)|
| 0:00:56| Well, I have not heard from them. However, I heard from them, I believe it was January when we voted to postpone until July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=56)|
| 0:01:05| And so I did not contact them because that is really not my responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=65)|
| 0:01:11| However, I'm totally aware of the location, totally aware of the situation that needed the postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=71)|
| 0:01:18| and I'm thinking that hasn't gotten resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=78)|
| 0:01:21| And if it would please the council or the beer board, I think that I would move that we postpone for two more weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=81)|
| 0:01:31| and I will try to â€“ excuse me, until the next beer board meeting, which would be in July,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=91)|
| 0:01:36| and I will see if I can determine what the status of that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=96)|
| 0:01:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=101)|

| 0:03:36| Nam Khanh, 7049 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=216)|
| 0:03:40| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=220)|
| 0:03:41| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=221)|
| 0:03:42| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=222)|
| 0:03:44| We need a building inspection approval, fire prevention approval, health department approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=224)|
| 0:03:48| and the final return from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=228)|
| 0:03:53| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=233)|
| 0:03:55| Actually, Councilman Gray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=235)|
| 0:03:56| Oh, Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=236)|
| 0:03:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=237)|
| 0:03:59| I've been having some discussions with our legal counsel and also with Mr. Husky,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=239)|
| 0:04:04| and I'd like to recognize Charles Swanson, our counsel, right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=244)|
| 0:04:08| There are still some few issues that are outstanding that the law department is looking into,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=248)|
| 0:04:12| and I think this may actually necessitate us having a postponement to the next beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=252)|
| 0:04:17| but I'd like to ask Mr. Swanson, please, to speak to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=257)|
| 0:04:20| There's a couple outstanding issues that are still being looked at by the law department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=260)|
| 0:04:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=265)|
| 0:04:26| There are a couple of outstanding issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| As you know, this is the former Michael's location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=267)|
| 0:04:30| and there was an agreed order by which that particular beer permit was surrendered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=270)|
| 0:04:36| and the litigation surrounding that was resolved as a part of that agreed order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| One of the things that was very significant to the city was that any subsequent permit holder there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=281)|
| 0:04:50| not in any way be related either financially or in any other way to any new permit holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=290)|
| 0:05:00| And in doing its due diligence with regard to that issue, the law department still needs some more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=300)|
| 0:05:08| I had information today from Allison Everting at the law department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| who indicates that they have furnished to them a proposed lease but not a finalized lease with respect to that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=313)|
| 0:05:20| but the lease itself doesn't give them quite enough information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| and they need some additional information before they can advise this beer board whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=324)|
| 0:05:29| or not this applicant is sufficiently independent from the previous operation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=329)|
| 0:05:36| that they are comfortable in saying that it would comply with the agreed order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| And so she has given me some things that they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=341)|
| 0:05:44| One of those things is the state records on the corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=344)|
| 0:05:47| which shows the directors and shareholders of the corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=347)|
| 0:05:52| The second thing that they need is a final version of the lease as opposed to simply a draft version of the lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=352)|
| 0:06:01| which was previously furnished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=361)|
| 0:06:04| And finally, they need to determine whether or not the citation that the applicant received| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=364)|
| 0:06:10| while it was Michael's for underage sale was resolved, and if it was resolved, in what fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=370)|
| 0:06:20| I can speak to a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=380)|
| 0:06:22| Would you identify yourself, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=382)|
| 0:06:24| My name is Arthur Jenkins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=384)|
| 0:06:26| And your address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=386)|
| 0:06:28| 800 South Gay Street, Suite 2100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=388)|
| 0:06:34| I'm here representing the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=394)|
| 0:06:37| The lease is not a draft form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=397)|
| 0:06:39| It's the final form, but she made agreement with the landlord that she wouldn't enter into a lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=399)|
| 0:06:45| until she knew she could get her permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=405)|
| 0:06:48| You know, that was the concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=408)|
| 0:06:51| So there aren't any changes to be made pending the application, and I think the lease references that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=411)|
| 0:06:58| You know, we can get the landlord to agree to sign the lease, I hope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=418)|
| 0:07:03| with the understanding that the lease will terminate if she can't get her license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=423)|
| 0:07:10| But that's the reason it was that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=430)|
| 0:07:12| I can perceive of two ways to handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=432)|
| 0:07:14| One way to handle that would be to get the landlord to sign it with the side agreement between the two of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=434)|
| 0:07:20| Another way to handle that might be, and I think this would be sufficient for the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| if you would convey the final version to the law department along with a letter that would be submitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=445)|
| 0:07:32| along with the record of that lease in this matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| saying that there will be no changes in the lease without those changes being brought before the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=456)|
| 0:07:43| I think that would work just as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=463)|
| 0:07:45| And that's no problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=465)|
| 0:07:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=467)|
| 0:07:48| But the only reason it's not signed, that was negotiated, that was worked,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| with the understanding that if she can't get her license, she doesn't want to lease the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=477)|
| 0:07:58| The location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=478)|
| 0:08:01| As to something from the state of Tennessee about the, did you ask for the officers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=481)|
| 0:08:05| The state records on the corporation, which show the directors and shareholders of the corporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=485)|
| 0:08:11| Actually, it's a limited liability company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=491)|
| 0:08:15| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| And somehow on the list here today, it got listed as an incorporation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=496)|
| 0:08:21| But on the application, it's listed as an LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=501)|
| 0:08:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=504)|
| 0:08:25| I don't know how that happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| It's brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=506)|
| 0:08:28| I'm unfamiliar with any state filing that lists the shareholders of such an organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=508)|
| 0:08:36| Then what would be appropriate is for you to furnish, again, to the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=516)|
| 0:08:41| Alice Nebertine at the law department, furnish to her a listing of all the members of the LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=521)|
| 0:08:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=527)|
| 0:08:48| That simply has her signature and indicates that that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=528)|
| 0:08:52| And that will also be tendered with the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=532)|
| 0:08:55| We provided Officer Husky with an affidavit that's been signed that says that he's not an owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=535)|
| 0:09:01| that he's not going to be an employee, that he's not an officer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=541)|
| 0:09:06| that he won't have any relationship to the business except he owns part of the company that is the landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=546)|
| 0:09:14| And I was under the understanding that the affidavit signed by her would be sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=554)|
| 0:09:19| I think that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=559)|
| 0:09:20| But I think what they want in addition to who is not, they want to know who is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=564)|
| 0:09:25| And so if you would get that information to the law department, either by means of an affidavit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| or by a letter that could be submitted with the record, that would be fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=570)|
| 0:09:34| whichever is easier for you to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| And then thirdly, we need the answer to the question about that citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=579)|
| 0:09:45| Mr. Chairman, let me ask a question while we're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=585)|
| 0:09:47| When do you plan on opening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| And I'm sorry, I didn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=591)|
| 0:09:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=593)|
| 0:09:54| I just wanted to address you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=594)|
| 0:09:55| When you get your permit and you move on with your lease, approximately when would you be open?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| They are trying to do a little bit of sprucing up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=601)|
| 0:10:07| I think it would probably be mid-July when everything, they would be ready to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=607)|
| 0:10:15| They were hoping to know that they had their permit in place before then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=615)|
| 0:10:21| And she can provide both of the things that we've talked about tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=621)|
| 0:10:26| We can get that lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| We can get the letter that's attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=628)|
| 0:10:30| She can prepare the list of members because she's the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=630)|
| 0:10:35| The other thing was the citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=635)|
| 0:10:38| I did not represent her on that citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=638)|
| 0:10:41| I haven't had the opportunity to ask her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=641)|
| 0:10:43| But my understanding in conversations has been that that citation was dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=643)|
| 0:10:48| She's right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=648)|
| 0:10:49| Why don't you ask her?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=649)|
| 0:10:51| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| It was dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| And it's been expunged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| So there's actually no record of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=655)|
| 0:10:58| There was no conviction prior to the expungement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=658)|
| 0:11:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| There was a dismissal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=662)|
| 0:11:04| A dismissal upon payment of cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=664)|
| 0:11:06| Is that what it was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| Her recollection is that it was a flat dismissal without payment of cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| I didn't represent her at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=676)|
| 0:11:18| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=678)|
| 0:11:19| The expungement's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| That's what I need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=684)|
| 0:11:27| I still think that the law department is going to need that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| And if it's the pleasure of the beer board to put it on five minutes before the next meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| then so be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| If it's not, then that would be okay, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| Councilman Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=703)|
| 0:11:44| Mr. Chairman, I was going to make a motion that this be postponed until the July 15th beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=704)|
| 0:11:54| So that will give ample time for all of these documents to be obtained and researched.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=714)|
| 0:12:07| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| I'm just wondering if we couldn't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| if the beer board wouldn't entertain the possibility of doing it five minutes before the next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| It sounds like they have what they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| It's just a matter of getting it processed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| I'm not sure exactly what we're up here to decide on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=742)|
| 0:12:25| If this is in part what we need to base our decision on in a postponement or what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=745)|
| 0:12:30| But, you know, there are other few things they have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=750)|
| 0:12:33| I'd want to try to move it along if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| If there's nothing, you know, really in our jurisdiction to oppose it, the sooner the better for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=755)|
| 0:12:45| There are a number of things in the file that are incomplete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=765)|
| 0:12:48| and this is what I'd consider an atypical beer board application considering the troubles in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=768)|
| 0:12:54| I'd respectfully submit it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| It couldn't be handled in five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=775)|
| 0:13:00| And that was the basis of my request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| Would the council like to elaborate on the specifics of what we would be discussing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=782)|
| 0:13:07| Well, they've got to get all their paperwork in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=787)|
| 0:13:09| and Mr. Swanson's asked for a lot of paperwork to get into the law department to look over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=789)|
| 0:13:17| And that's an outgrowth of the agreement where the previous ownership of Michael's gave up their permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=797)|
| 0:13:28| I mean, that's only ever happened once before, and that was for the Red Iguana,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| and that's more than a five-minute situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=813)|
| 0:13:39| But, you know, whatever the desire of council is, it's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=819)|
| 0:13:43| This is in the district I represent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=823)|
| 0:13:45| and I feel strongly that due to the history of this establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| and due to the lengths to which this has gone to make sure that things are all in order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=829)|
| 0:13:59| that we would be remiss in not giving the law department ample time to take care of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=839)|
| 0:14:05| And, of course, I see here there are a number of outstanding documents that have not been completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=845)|
| 0:14:12| including the task program certificate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| So I just, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| The task program certificate was filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=857)|
| 0:14:20| Well, I'm just looking at the documentation in front of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=860)|
| 0:14:22| I understand, but that was filed a couple of days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=862)|
| 0:14:26| Well, apparently it was after our past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=866)|
| 0:14:29| I understand. I just wanted to make sure everybody understood that if she has completed it, that's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=869)|
| 0:14:34| And that's good and important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=874)|
| 0:14:37| Definitely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=877)|
| 0:14:39| I stand by my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=880)|
| 0:14:43| I just want to ask, we do have the task certification in hand, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| Well, how do you feel about a postponement until mid-July?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| We believe that we can provide the law office with the two documents that are requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=895)|
| 0:15:02| You know, we can't provide anything on the citation because the citation was expunged to the effect that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=902)|
| 0:15:09| you know, for the court's record it doesn't exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=909)|
| 0:15:12| But we can have a signed copy of the lease tomorrow morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| and she can sign an affidavit saying exactly who the members are of her LLC tomorrow morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=916)|
| 0:15:25| I can go prepare that tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| You know, we're doing our best to try to get a business open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| and I will say that there has been a business in place between the old Michaels and what we're talking about here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=932)|
| 0:15:39| And we understand that because we approve that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=939)|
| 0:15:42| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=942)|
| 0:15:43| I'm just trying to make sure that that was out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| Very much so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=947)|
| 0:15:48| I don't know, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=948)|
| 0:15:49| I'm just of the opinion that we ought to deal with what's before us legally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=949)|
| 0:15:54| and I think that we work for them, they don't work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| And if, in fact, the city, they owe the city certain things and they can get it in in time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=958)|
| 0:16:04| then we ought to give them the benefit of the doubt and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| And I don't think they're responsible for past actions or what that building has done in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=967)|
| 0:16:12| and that's just where I stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=977)|
| 0:16:18| Was that a motion of any kind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| No, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| I think there's a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| There is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=983)|
| 0:16:25| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| There's a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| Yes, we have a motion to postpone to the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=987)|
| 0:16:31| On July 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=991)|
| 0:16:32| On July 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=992)|
| 0:16:34| Which is the 15th, and they hope to open around the 15th, around the middle of the month, so that should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=994)|
| 0:16:40| Let me, Councilman Pelo, respectfully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| I think what they're saying is that they're not even going to move on the lease until they get a permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1004)|
| 0:16:50| so that's going to hold them back a full month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1013)|
| 0:16:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1014)|
| 0:16:56| I'm sorry to be a stickler on that, but I just feel strongly that that's the position I need to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1016)|
| 0:17:03| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1023)|
| 0:17:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1024)|
| 0:17:05| Let me make sure I just understood what you said, Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| Are you saying that if this is postponed to July 15th, that's going to delay your opening a month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1028)|
| 0:17:15| What we're saying is that we're afraid to enter into a lease for this building until we know that she can get her permits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1035)|
| 0:17:23| and, you know, what the landlord will let happen pending that time when, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| they don't know if this young lady can get a beer permit, you know, that probably will slow us down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1049)|
| 0:17:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Now, that's a little different than what you just agreed to and said it would slow you down a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1059)|
| 0:17:43| so now you say it probably will slow you down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1063)|
| 0:17:45| Well, you know, I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| Help me understand the process with regards to the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| And if I was there, I wouldn't want to sign a lease until I know I can get a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| That's understandable, because I wouldn't want anybody holding me responsible for a lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1075)|
| 0:17:58| and I couldn't conduct the business I wanted to do there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1078)|
| 0:18:04| But help me understand what you see with regards to the timing of executing of the lease| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| and when she can open up her doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| I think, respectfully, I think it deals with what she can come into the building and do that she feels like she needs to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1092)|
| 0:18:21| and the landlord say, well, okay, go do this, but I won't hold you to a lease after you've made these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1101)|
| 0:18:28| You know, and I can't specifically say the landlord will do this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1108)|
| 0:18:33| or the landlord won't let her do that when he doesn't know if he's got a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| That's what I'm trying to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1117)|
| 0:18:41| So what does two weeks do in making a difference with regards to what you just said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1121)|
| 0:18:47| How does two weeks impact that one way or the other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1127)|
| 0:18:50| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1130)|
| 0:18:51| Whether it's we have a 10, 15-minute meeting before the next council meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1131)|
| 0:18:56| or whether we have it at the next beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| What does that two weeks do in your negotiations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1139)|
| 0:19:02| I would think, and I'm not, if I was representing the landlord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1142)|
| 0:19:05| I'd tell the landlord don't let her go in and do wholesale changes and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| because you don't know that you're going to have a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| You don't know what she's going to try to change and where you're going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1152)|
| 0:19:15| So two weeks, I guess that's, you know, additional two weeks' worth of work potentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1155)|
| 0:19:21| So she's not sure yet what changes she wants to make internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| Well, she has ideas about what she wants to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1165)|
| 0:19:28| Does she have any ideas about how long that will take?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| More than two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1172)|
| 0:19:35| It just closed last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1175)|
| 0:19:39| No, you never know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1179)|
| 0:19:46| She's saying she doesn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| And she's not going to be able to do that work until she knows she can get a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1188)|
| 0:19:53| and then she can sign her lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1193)|
| 0:19:54| Then they're going to let her go in and do that work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1194)|
| 0:19:56| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1196)|
| 0:19:58| I'm saying that that's my concern, that the landlord won't let her go in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| and make changes if he doesn't know that he has a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1201)|
| 0:20:05| And I haven't addressed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1205)|
| 0:20:07| So you're not sure whether the landlord will let her go in tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1207)|
| 0:20:10| or whether the landlord is going to wait until after she's got a grant on a beer permit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1210)|
| 0:20:14| and has a signed lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| If she knows she can get her beer permit, she's going to sign the lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1216)|
| 0:20:19| If the only thing that's remaining is the three inspections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1219)|
| 0:20:25| I think she feels comfortable signing the lease because those people have been there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1225)|
| 0:20:28| and had inspected it and given a list of what they think needs to be corrected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1228)|
| 0:20:34| And so I think if it's pending those three things, then she was going to go sign a lease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1234)|
| 0:20:41| If, yes, the landlord is willing to allow the execution of the lease subject to the final approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| of the beer permit and that if said approval does not come through, then the lease would then be void?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1247)|
| 0:20:53| I have not addressed that with the landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1253)|
| 0:20:59| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1259)|
| 0:21:00| Yeah, I guess, Councilman Bailey, I'm kind of glad you raised this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| because it seemed simple until you started asking questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1264)|
| 0:21:06| And I guess, Ms. Pelo, just to go back, it feels like this is a big deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1266)|
| 0:21:12| and I'm glad we're postponing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| We're not ready to make a decision now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| I'm going to respect your wishes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| and I've heard you say you feel strongly about postponing it until July 15th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| And I guess the question is, assuming they get this information in tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| and the law department looks at it by the end of the week and there's not a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| law department's determined there is no direct connection, the lease is fine, all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| my sense is we could do something in the five minutes beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| And I'm wondering whether, because it does feel like postponing for that extra two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| does put her back two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1307)|
| 0:21:49| If I'm the landlord, I'm not going to want her in making changes on the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1309)|
| 0:21:53| So, I mean, I guess just to say, again, I'll respect your wishes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| but to raise the question again to see what you feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1316)|
| 0:21:59| Mr. Becker, we've had other situations where we've postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1319)|
| 0:22:03| and then matters have been resolved satisfactorily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1323)|
| 0:22:07| And then we have been able to determine that we will hear it early.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1327)|
| 0:22:12| And I don't think that's unreasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1332)|
| 0:22:14| I just simply want to be sure that before they come back before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1334)|
| 0:22:19| their documentation is totally complete,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| the law department has had the time to look at this in addition to all the other things they do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1342)|
| 0:22:28| and that we can feel comfortable that the arrangement is going to confirm the very difficult situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1348)|
| 0:22:36| that we had when these other leases have been, well, one permit was denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| another permit was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1361)|
| 0:22:44| And, you know, I'm very anxious for this particular property to do well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1364)|
| 0:22:50| and for a business there to do well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| And very frankly, I attended the opening when Lisa Smith opened her palace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1372)|
| 0:22:59| And I would like to do the same for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| But I want to be sure that we are all comfortable that what you're doing is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1381)|
| 0:23:07| and in your best interest as well as ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| So that is the reason I feel strongly that in our best interest we need to make a four-week postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1389)|
| 0:23:16| And then if reconsideration is necessary, this is a very reasonable council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1396)|
| 0:23:22| And I'm sure they will give you every consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| Councilwoman Roderick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| I'm just wondering if a middle ground would be, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1410)|
| 0:23:34| Councilman Pila mentioned that sometimes we've postponed for four weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1414)|
| 0:23:38| but things have been ready and we've been able to do it within two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| Could we do the reverse?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1422)|
| 0:23:43| Could we postpone for two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| And if the law department is not comfortable that the documentation has been presented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| at that point convene the five minutes, ten minutes ahead, and postpone again for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1429)|
| 0:23:55| And that way the applicant has the opportunity to perhaps be prepared in two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| But if it's not there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| That's something that the Beer Board could do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| Is that an acceptable friendly amendment to the postponement to the makers of the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1448)|
| 0:24:19| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1459)|
| 0:24:20| Were you speaking to me directly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1460)|
| 0:24:21| Is that an acceptable friendly amendment to the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| I made my motion knowing the history of this property, knowing the difficulties there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1465)|
| 0:24:31| and knowing the surrounding area is very interested in this being a totally satisfactory business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1471)|
| 0:24:38| And so I feel that to represent my district, that's the position I needed to take tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1478)|
| 0:24:45| But, I mean, whatever you all determine that you feel is best, I would certainly respect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1485)|
| 0:24:52| But, respectfully, I have to ask you to understand my position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| Councilman Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1497)|
| 0:24:58| I guess, again, Ms. Peel, I'll respect your wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1498)|
| 0:25:01| And what I'm hearing you is if by the end of the week the law department has said this is fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| then we're going to have a special meeting on the 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| That works for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| Councilman Bailey?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| Is there a mechanism, a way we can do that, trigger that, Mr. Vice Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1511)|
| 0:25:16| Typically, somebody calls me and requests it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| That would be fine with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1520)|
| 0:25:21| And if somebody in the law department or Mr. Swanson calls me and tells me everything's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1521)|
| 0:25:27| then I have no problem doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| If everybody feels more comfortable with that, if someone, if the law department will call me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| I will call you and request that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1534)|
| 0:25:37| If that would make everybody feel very comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1537)|
| 0:25:39| That's typically how it's done, as the billboard chairman said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1539)|
| 0:25:43| If it's set off for four weeks from now and everything's worked out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| you could ask the law department to request that the billboard chairman have it put on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| and then send an e-mail out to council and put it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| And the billboard chairman makes those decisions, and we've done it before that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1553)|
| 0:25:56| The notification, though, has to go out ten days ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1556)|
| 0:25:58| Well, you can't have a new notification that would sort of preempt the old notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1558)|
| 0:26:05| But is the notification time ten days?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| Ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| So if we're talking about having 14 days, then all of this has to be resolved in four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| whereas if we postpone for two and then they can't do it and they go four, I don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1575)|
| 0:26:20| it just seems like you have more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1580)|
| 0:26:23| The applicant, to me, would have more time to resolve this if we postpone it for two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| and then if we're not ready, bump it, because then the notification can go ahead and go out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| whereas if we postpone it for four and hoping to back it up to two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| but there has to be ten days before the two, they really only have four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1596)|
| 0:26:41| Yeah, but he says he can get it done tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1601)|
| 0:26:43| He says it's a matter of just simply producing the documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| and then the law department needs to take care of whatever they need to handle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| and then that information needs to get to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| So if he is that comfortable with it, I don't think we would be imposing a difficulty on him,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1615)|
| 0:27:00| because that's four days in which to know if the documentation you've submitted is going to satisfy the law department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1620)|
| 0:27:07| right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| But it's not a high day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1631)|
| 0:27:13| I didn't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1633)|
| 0:27:15| That would be by Friday, I guess, to get the ten days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1635)|
| 0:27:18| I guess Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1638)|
| 0:27:21| Well, they have to know a little in advance, I've been told, to place the ad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| Isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1648)|
| 0:27:29| We're not required to re-advertise on a deferment, so we won't re-advertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1649)|
| 0:27:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| Okay, but what do you want to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| To answer that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| In the event, and it's probably not likely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1656)|
| 0:27:38| in the event there is somebody sitting at home watching this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| and we postpone for four weeks and then decide to short circuit the postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1662)|
| 0:27:48| and they might have wanted to have come to speak about it, and then they're cut off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1668)|
| 0:27:54| Wouldn't it have been easier to just simply postpone for two weeks than if we have to postpone for two more weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1674)|
| 0:28:00| Do it that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| I would think anybody who's watching this is going to know it's either going to be two or either going to be four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1683)|
| 0:28:07| and if I were them, I would watch the agendas very carefully.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| If I had an interest in coming to speak on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| I would watch the agenda for two weeks from now very carefully to see if there was anything there on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| And if there wasn't, I'd wait for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| All the council office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1701)|
| 0:28:23| Call Barbara.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1705)|
| 0:28:27| Many people do, and it's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| We have a motion to postpone for four weeks to the July 15th regularly scheduled beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1712)|
| 0:28:39| Four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1721)|
| 0:28:42| Chairman Hall, I'd like to say to Councilman Pelo, I completely understand your position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| I'm going to vote against the motion because I'm concerned about the process and the notification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| But I do want this to be resolved satisfactorily.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| Let me say one thing with all due respect to Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| I wanted to make sure that the language of short-circuiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| In the past, we haven't short-circuited the process by having something on it in a couple of weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1745)|
| 0:29:10| I don't want anybody to go around thinking this council has been short-circuiting the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1750)|
| 0:29:14| and granting beer licenses out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1754)|
| 0:29:16| We've had occasion before going through the appropriate processes where the chairman has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| and this council has had items put back on in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| and I just want to make sure that no one at home took that or the headlines tomorrow under the byline from Mr. Hickman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1763)|
| 0:29:30| said council short-circuits beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1770)|
| 0:29:32| He's asleep.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| Oh, he's asleep?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1773)|
| 0:29:35| I didn't mean to wake you there, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1775)|
| 0:29:37| Sorry about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1777)|
| 0:29:38| Actually, we've done it to accommodate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1778)|
| 0:29:40| And that is what I hear in the intent tonight would be to accommodate this young lady if that is possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1780)|
| 0:29:49| It is not to short-circuit beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| Why don't we just make a motion to postpone for two weeks, and then if it has to get postponed again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1792)|
| 0:29:59| it's the same thing and people, if it's postponed for two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1799)|
| 0:30:06| people know without a doubt that we will be here at 655 on July 1st to take this up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1806)|
| 0:30:13| and either vote on it or vote to postpone it for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1813)|
| 0:30:19| Mr. Chairman, I'm just going to say to my fine colleague from the second district, I respect her intent here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| but I do think this is the cleanest way to go is to postpone it for two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1825)|
| 0:30:29| so I'm going to vote against your proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1829)|
| 0:30:39| Are we ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1839)|
| 0:30:41| Is everybody clear what we're voting on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1841)|
| 0:30:45| We're voting to postpone until the July 15th beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1845)|
| 0:30:51| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1853)|
| 0:30:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| Do you have a count?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| Councilman Pilo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Councilman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1861)|
| 0:31:02| Councilman Woodhull.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1862)|
| 0:31:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1863)|
| 0:31:04| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1864)|
| 0:31:05| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1865)|
| 0:31:06| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1867)|
| 0:31:08| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1869)|
| 0:31:10| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1870)|
| 0:31:11| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1872)|
| 0:31:13| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1873)|
| 0:31:14| Councilman Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| Five-four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| So it has been postponed four weeks with a vote of five-four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1882)|
| 0:31:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| Change Ripshack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1893)|
| 0:31:41| Jeremy McCosh, 413 Navajo Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| Ms. Dyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1907)|
| 0:31:48| I need a building inspection approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1908)|
| 0:31:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1911)|
| 0:31:53| Do we have a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1915)|
| 0:31:57| I spoke with Ms. Day this afternoon regarding a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| Do we have any information yet from the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1921)|
| 0:32:04| It's in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| I'm just waiting on them to come out and inspect me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| and that should be it, honestly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| The ABC permit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1930)|
| 0:32:11| The ABC permit, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| You have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1932)|
| 0:32:13| We don't have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1933)|
| 0:32:14| They have to come and inspect us first, themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1934)|
| 0:32:17| They do their own inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1937)|
| 0:32:19| The application is in for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1939)|
| 0:32:23| So you don't have an ABC permit right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1943)|
| 0:32:28| No, do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| You probably don't have a beer permit right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1950)|
| 0:32:34| My understanding is we can't issue a beer permit at this location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1954)|
| 0:32:37| because of the distance problem until the ABC permit is resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| And I don't know whether that's something that we can approve pending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| if that's a pending final documentation thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1964)|
| 0:32:46| or if it needs to be postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1966)|
| 0:32:48| I guess I would ask for counsel's opinion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1968)|
| 0:32:50| It's at beer board's pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| You could do it either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| You could make it subject to final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| and the documentation includes them furnishing a copy of a valid ABC permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1978)|
| 0:33:03| or you could wait until they actually have the valid ABC permit in hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1983)|
| 0:33:07| It's your pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| Mr. Swanson, we could postpone for four weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1989)|
| 0:33:12| and then have a special meeting if he's got his permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| or we could postpone it for two weeks, and if he doesn't have his permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1994)|
| 0:33:17| we could put it off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1997)|
| 0:33:19| You have so many options, it's really incredible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=1999)|
| 0:33:21| but those are included among your options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2001)|
| 0:33:24| It's a procedural buffet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| Chairman Hall, I'll make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2009)|
| 0:33:31| I move that we approve this permit pending final documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2011)|
| 0:33:35| that documentation to include a valid, I believe it's called an ABC permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| from the State of Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2019)|
| 0:33:41| and other documentation in the normal course of events that is missing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| but that in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2026)|
| 0:33:48| And I don't remember, and I appreciate the counsel that we can do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2028)|
| 0:33:53| I don't know that we've ever done it as a beer board committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2033)|
| 0:33:58| since I have been on counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2038)|
| 0:34:00| I'm assuming, Mr. Swanson, that other beer boards have done this in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| has exercised this power that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| I truthfully do not have real recollection of that one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| We might have or we might not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| I would rely on someone else's memory being better than mine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2055)|
| 0:34:19| if somebody does have a recollection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2059)|
| 0:34:22| I don't remember us doing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2062)|
| 0:34:23| but I know you have a lot of institutional knowledge that I don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2063)|
| 0:34:27| that maybe you or Sidney would remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| I just had a question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2069)|
| 0:34:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2070)|
| 0:34:31| Some of it has faded into the background.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2071)|
| 0:34:32| Was there a second to that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2072)|
| 0:34:39| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2079)|
| 0:34:40| I second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2080)|
| 0:34:41| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2081)|
| 0:34:45| I guess I have to say this doesn't feel right to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| I mean, this feels like one of those biggies for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2088)|
| 0:34:52| because technically, I mean, yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2092)|
| 0:34:55| I guess the ABC permit is a thing that you either have or you don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2095)|
| 0:34:59| but it feels like we're on thinner ice than we are with some things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2099)|
| 0:35:04| I mean, we've been hesitant to do approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2104)|
| 0:35:07| pending final documentation on the task certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| I don't know if I feel comfortable with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| and I hate to vote somehow against your motion and have this fail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| so my inclination is to say we should do a postponement rather than vote this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2124)|
| 0:35:25| But I'll see the councilperson who represents the district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2125)|
| 0:35:29| and I'll wait for further comments before I make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2129)|
| 0:35:33| Councilman Hopeless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| Well, I'm just trying to get my arms around the reality here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2134)|
| 0:35:40| and the reality is that state law essentially trumps us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2140)|
| 0:35:45| and we can pretend that we have real authority to make these kinds of decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2145)|
| 0:35:52| but in reality, if they get the ABC permit, we can't deny them a permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2152)|
| 0:35:57| So, you know, does it really, really matter in the final analysis?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2157)|
| 0:36:03| So if I felt like there was something to be accomplished by doing it one way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2163)|
| 0:36:10| or the other, I would care, but I don't think it really matters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2170)|
| 0:36:15| I think, again, state law takes it out of our hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| and so I'm not really interested in pretending that it's otherwise,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2179)|
| 0:36:23| that the situation indicates anything to the contrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2183)|
| 0:36:26| So I guess the bottom line for me is the one that represents this area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2186)|
| 0:36:31| the district that this location is in, is that I don't really care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2191)|
| 0:36:38| I'm fine with going the way it's proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2198)|
| 0:36:44| Councilman Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| Well, I just have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2205)|
| 0:36:46| When did you submit your ABC application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2206)|
| 0:36:50| Yesterday, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2210)|
| 0:36:52| Oh, gee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2212)|
| 0:36:53| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| Guess what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| You know, my understanding is it's at least a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| My thinking was when you were here previously, you were going to submit it right away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2219)|
| 0:37:05| and then by the time you came back, that would be resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2225)|
| 0:37:09| Well, we found out we could do a wine only, which is cheaper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2229)|
| 0:37:12| so we had to change a few things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| Well, I was just hoping that you were going to say a month ago, and it should be, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2236)|
| 0:37:22| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2245)|
| 0:37:26| I wanted to say, you know, so explain my vote I'm about to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| I think we've been giving good, sound advice from our council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2249)|
| 0:37:32| and I think it's good legal advice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2252)|
| 0:37:34| but I just personally don't want to set a precedent of doing it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2254)|
| 0:37:39| I think we can legally do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2259)|
| 0:37:40| I think Mr. Schwartz is right, and I, you know, rely very heavily on his recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2260)|
| 0:37:45| so I don't want anyone to interpret my vote as I think he is wrong with his legal interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2265)|
| 0:37:50| I just personally, and it's not that I, for different reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| I'm getting to the same conclusions as Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2274)|
| 0:37:56| It's not that I don't feel that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2276)|
| 0:37:58| I just don't want to set the precedent of making one of our Subject 2 final documentations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| a document that has to come from another agency, you know, out of town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2283)|
| 0:38:07| and, you know, we kind of open that door to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| a whole litany of those kind of coming forward down the line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2290)|
| 0:38:13| So I think we can legally do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2293)|
| 0:38:15| We have the authority to do it, probably in jurisdiction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2295)|
| 0:38:17| but it's not a vote against you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2297)|
| 0:38:19| I just want to not make, I don't want to set that precedent for myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2299)|
| 0:38:26| And I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| Yeah, I'd like, for procedural purposes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2310)|
| 0:38:32| I'd like to make a motion to postpone until the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2312)|
| 0:38:36| and I'm going to do that because I don't want this motion to fail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| And I think if we want to postpone, we should postpone rather than vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2319)|
| 0:38:43| So I'll make a motion to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2323)|
| 0:38:46| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2326)|
| 0:38:49| Chairman, did you say you agree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2329)|
| 0:38:51| I agree with Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2331)|
| 0:38:53| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2333)|
| 0:38:55| Councilman Huqquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2335)|
| 0:38:56| Well, first of all, Councilman Frost corrected me on something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2336)|
| 0:39:00| I had a misperception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2340)|
| 0:39:02| I was wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2342)|
| 0:39:03| It is not state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| It is city ordinance that says that if you have an ABC permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2344)|
| 0:39:08| then you can get a city beer permit regardless of the distance requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2348)|
| 0:39:15| So that's a very different situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2355)|
| 0:39:17| So I will back up or retract on my previous statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2357)|
| 0:39:21| because if the city ordinance and we don't agree with it, we can change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| That's a whole different ballgame.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2365)|
| 0:39:27| So I apologize for my misstatement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| And I will go with the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| Under the circumstances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2373)|
| 0:39:34| I tend to agree that everything else being equal that we should approach it that way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2374)|
| 0:39:39| and be cautious about giving too much leeway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| But I also think that we should take another look at that ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2383)|
| 0:39:48| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2388)|
| 0:39:49| I just wonder if we should refer this to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2389)|
| 0:39:55| They need more to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| I'd like to call for a workshop in January of 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2398)|
| 0:40:03| How about December 16, 2009?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| Yeah, that would work, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| We have a motion and a second to postpone for a whole regular scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2410)|
| 0:40:22| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2424)|

| 0:41:41| Do we want to bring it up sooner if they show up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| About the end of the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2503)|

| 0:42:08| Building inspection approval, fire prevention approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2528)|

| 0:42:19| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| The only thing I'd say, that is an excellent place to eat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2541)|
| 0:42:24| At least I can certainly certify that the one in Bearden is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2544)|
| 0:42:28| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| My husband would be quite hungry if you closed that down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| And you know that North Knoxville food is better than West Knoxville food by definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2552)|
| 0:42:36| I'm very concerned about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| But I think Mr. Cornett is going to work hard not to allow that to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2558)|
| 0:42:42| I'm just hoping they put the firecracker rice bowl with beef on the North Knoxville menu.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2562)|
| 0:42:47| It'll be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2567)|

| 0:42:54| Yeah, I've retained some ownership in it, but they own the majority now, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| They purchased it from me last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2578)|
| 0:42:59| That's what I remember reading in the paper, I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2579)|
| 0:43:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| But you still have an interest, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2583)|

| 0:45:31| because parts of it were set to sunset and not sunset,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| and there was some confusion that maybe the state law trumped what we did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2734)|
| 0:45:38| although local law can be more strict than state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2738)|
| 0:45:41| So I asked the law department about this in Chairman Hall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2741)|
| 0:45:46| and Ms. Eberting in the law department wrote a memo to Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2746)|
| 0:45:50| and I've asked him just to review that so that if any of you all have similar questions from folks in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2750)|
| 0:45:55| it might clear up some of this confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| Maybe I'm the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| Well, you all will recall that the law requires the off-premises beer permit holders to ID everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2760)|
| 0:46:12| and there was a sunset provision in that law when it was created that said after a year it would sunset if it wasn't unsunsetted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2772)|
| 0:46:21| or if it wasn't reenacted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| That was at the state level, but ours didn't sunset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| That was at the state level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2784)|
| 0:46:25| Our local law did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2785)|
| 0:46:26| Our local law did not sunset, but this is the state law that deals in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2786)|
| 0:46:31| And you will recall that you adopted a resolution requesting that it not be allowed to sunset and that it be continued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2791)|
| 0:46:39| And the state legislature has, in fact, deleted the sunset provision of that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2799)|
| 0:46:47| There are three things that it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| The first thing that it did was it deleted the sunset provision so that it no longer is scheduled to sunset on July the 1st of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2809)|
| 0:46:57| The second thing that it did, it provided that every clerk had to wear a badge with his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2817)|
| 0:47:04| or her first and last name on that badge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2824)|
| 0:47:07| It deleted the requirement for the last name so that the clerk's first name has to be on the badge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2827)|
| 0:47:12| but does not have to have the last name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2832)|
| 0:47:14| That's the second change that it made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| The third thing that it changed, and I probably should just read this to you so you'll understand what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2837)|
| 0:47:25| There's been some publicity to the effect that if you're 50 or more, there's no longer a requirement to card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2845)|
| 0:47:32| That's really not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2852)|
| 0:47:33| The requirement for everyone to be ID'd remains in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| Now what it says is this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2858)|
| 0:47:41| In addition to the prohibition of making a sale to a minor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2861)|
| 0:47:45| no sale of beer for off-premises consumption shall be made to a person who does not present such a document,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2865)|
| 0:47:51| and that's the proper kind of ID, or other form of identification to the permit holder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2871)|
| 0:47:57| or any employee of the permit holder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2877)|
| 0:48:00| However, and here's the new language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2880)|
| 0:48:03| it is an exception to any criminal punishment or adverse administrative action,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2883)|
| 0:48:08| including license suspension or revocation, as provided for a violation of this section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2888)|
| 0:48:13| if the sale was made to a person who is or reasonably appears to be over the age of 50| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2893)|
| 0:48:19| and who failed to present an acceptable form of identification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2899)|
| 0:48:23| So what it essentially says, if somebody is over 50 or reasonably appears to be over 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2903)|
| 0:48:31| it's still a requirement that they be ID'd, but there's not much you can do about it if they don't ID them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2911)|
| 0:48:36| There's no punishment involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| And what it says, you need to understand, it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| sale made to a person who, one, reasonably appears to be over the age of 50 or is, in fact, over the age of 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2921)|
| 0:48:50| So it's like if they sell to me, even though I don't look to be 50, it would be okay because I am over 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2930)|
| 0:48:58| On the other hand, if you sell to Mr. Frost, who is not 50 but reasonably appears to be over 50, that would be okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2938)|
| 0:49:10| What about the city ordinance that does require?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2950)|
| 0:49:14| Isn't all of this moot within the city of Knoxville because we are still,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2954)|
| 0:49:18| our ordinance still says that you must card every time that if, let's say that you, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2958)|
| 0:49:23| left your ID in the car and the clerk cards you and you have no ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| the clerk is not supposed to sell within the city of Knoxville, even though you might appear to be over 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2968)|
| 0:49:33| What I just said was that it didn't change the requirement that you have to ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| You still have to ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| But if we try to do something about it, if they fail to ID under our ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2979)|
| 0:49:44| somebody who is either over 50 or appeared to be over, reasonably appeared to be over 50,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2984)|
| 0:49:51| I suspect we would be trumped by the state law in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2991)|
| 0:49:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2997)|
| 0:49:58| I was confused about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2998)|
| 0:49:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=2999)|
| 0:50:00| Once the state enters the area, we get trumped by the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| And the state clearly has entered this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| That's a law more strict than the state, but they can still trump us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| If they deal in an area, very specifically in an area, we are always trumped by the state law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=3010)|
| 0:50:18| Councilman Palo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=3018)|
| 0:50:22| Is there any other business that needs to come before the beer board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| Oh, I guess we should ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=3025)|
| 0:50:29| Was it wing stop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=3029)|
| 0:50:31| Wing stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| I'll call it one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=3032)|
| 0:50:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=3034)|
| 0:50:35| Then I move that we adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=3039)|
| 0:50:41| If there's no wings here, we'll go home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd080617?start=3041)|
