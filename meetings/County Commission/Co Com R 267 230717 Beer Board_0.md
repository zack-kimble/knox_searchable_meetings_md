| 0:09:35| Do you admit or deny those allegations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=575.0)|
| 0:09:38| We do admit with an explanation, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=578.0)|
| 0:09:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=580.0)|
| 0:09:43| Ms. Patel has opened that store at the end of June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=583.0)|
| 0:09:46| She was just before this body to receive her permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=586.0)|
| 0:09:49| She has been very grateful that Knox County has been so supportive of her store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=589.0)|
| 0:09:53| It happened to be an incredibly busy day, and the ID that she was presented with, they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=593.0)|
| 0:09:57| do have the scanning capabilities to scan that barcode for whatever reason that barcode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=597.0)|
| 0:10:02| wasn't reading into the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=602.0)|
| 0:10:04| And so Ms. Patel went to manually enter that birth date into the system, and she just miskeyed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=604.0)|
| 0:10:09| it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=609.0)|
| 0:10:10| It was an absolute mistake on her part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=610.0)|
| 0:10:11| She absolutely acknowledges that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=611.0)|
| 0:10:13| And in the interim, she has completed an additional TABC course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=613.0)|
| 0:10:17| I have that certificate if the chair would like it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=617.0)|
| 0:10:19| And so she has tried to take this as a learning opportunity that regardless of how busy that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=619.0)|
| 0:10:25| store is, she absolutely needs to slow down, make sure that every single digit is checked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=625.0)|
| 0:10:30| and double checked, especially when we have a card that does not scan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=630.0)|
| 0:10:34| And so those are the circumstances we'd ask this commission to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=634.0)|
| 0:10:38| She is very grateful that that store is doing well, but obviously that comes with the tremendous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=638.0)|
| 0:10:43| responsibility of carrying that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=643.0)|
| 0:10:45| She understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=645.0)|
| 0:10:46| And so we are before this body asking for some consideration to allow her to continue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=646.0)|
| 0:10:50| to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=650.0)|
| 0:10:52| And like I said, I can provide that additional TABC card that she received last week if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=652.0)|
| 0:10:56| would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=656.0)|

| 0:11:05| Is Ms. Patel aware that in the state of Tennessee, that if you're under 21 years of age, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=665.0)|

| 0:11:14| If you're over 21, it's this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=674.0)|
| 0:11:18| The state did that to make it easy for store owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=678.0)|
| 0:11:23| They made it idiot proof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=683.0)|
| 0:11:25| So, is she aware that if it comes in like this to not ever sell beer, you don't even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=685.0)|
| 0:11:29| need to scan it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=689.0)|
| 0:11:31| Is she aware of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=691.0)|
| 0:11:32| Plus, there's also a red bar across it as well?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=692.0)|
| 0:11:35| She is aware of those things, Commissioner, and she is now duly informed as to taking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=695.0)|
| 0:11:40| that secondary class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=700.0)|
| 0:11:41| And I will say that she came to this country legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=701.0)|
| 0:11:45| English is her second language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=705.0)|
| 0:11:47| And so, unfortunately, there are some times where her language barrier is not to her benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=707.0)|
| 0:11:52| And I think that may have been one that it was helpful for her to hear all of those explanations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=712.0)|
| 0:11:57| a second time through her second course that she took so that she duly understood that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=717.0)|
| 0:12:01| that is the easy, no-nonsense way to make sure that this does not happen again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=721.0)|
| 0:12:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=726.0)|
| 0:12:07| And then the other thing is when we issue a beer permit and then they violate it nine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=727.0)|
| 0:12:13| days later, I mean, the community finds that unacceptable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=733.0)|
| 0:12:17| And I think Ms. Patel would be the first person to say that she is very disappointed to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=737.0)|

| 0:12:23| And so, I hope that in the steps that she has taken, there are only two employees at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=743.0)|

| 0:12:43| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=763.0)|

| 0:12:50| Are you willing to take this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=770.0)|
| 0:12:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=771.0)|

| 0:12:53| I do commend Ms. Patel for operating a business in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=773.0)|
| 0:13:00| We like to see businesses thriving in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=780.0)|
| 0:13:03| However, I do echo my colleague's concerns about the nine days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=783.0)|
| 0:13:08| And I think it is true the community would be quite disappointed in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=788.0)|
| 0:13:14| And, you know, in keeping with our protocol, I am going to offer a motion that we follow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=794.0)|
| 0:13:22| our precedent on first offenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=802.0)|
| 0:13:25| However, if there is a second offense, especially in a short period of time, I don't think this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=805.0)|
| 0:13:31| body will be disposed to be quite as lenient as we normally would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=811.0)|
| 0:13:37| Maybe lenient is not the right word, but we might have to break precedent if a second| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=817.0)|

| 0:20:48| Next agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1248.0)|
| 0:20:59| We added to agenda the discussion of the state inspection beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1259.0)|
| 0:21:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1264.0)|
| 0:21:05| This was an item added by Mr. Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1265.0)|
| 0:21:10| The floor is yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1270.0)|
| 0:21:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1271.0)|
| 0:21:14| Mr. Law Director, have you and Mr. Moyers had a discussion about this by chance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1274.0)|
| 0:21:22| I can't recall that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1282.0)|
| 0:21:24| What precisely is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1284.0)|
| 0:21:26| I've had a discussion with Mr. Moyers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1286.0)|
| 0:21:28| Last month we approved a beer permit for John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1288.0)|
| 0:21:34| The holdup was he could not sell his business because the state of Tennessee would not go out and inspect until the transaction was completed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1294.0)|
| 0:21:43| which is totally wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1303.0)|
| 0:21:46| So it held up the sale for days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1306.0)|
| 0:21:49| I asked Mr. Moyers to check into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1309.0)|
| 0:21:52| I'm not putting any words in his mouth because he's not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1312.0)|
| 0:21:55| It's my understanding that we can't issue a beer permit even if the state does not send in that letter of inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1315.0)|
| 0:22:04| We can issue that according to our ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1324.0)|
| 0:22:07| So we might need to take this discussion up next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1327.0)|
| 0:22:12| We can't hold, even though I don't drink beer and I wish it was never invented as far as I'm concerned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1332.0)|
| 0:22:18| but we cannot hold up a business from being sold or opened because the state of Tennessee don't want to go and do a health inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1338.0)|
| 0:22:29| I agree with that, and I don't know why it got turned away from the health department to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1349.0)|
| 0:22:36| Because as soon as you get the bureaucracy of the state, you're exactly right, and it's not fair in my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1356.0)|
| 0:22:44| And I don't know why we can't get it back with the health department because they can act as they used to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1364.0)|
| 0:22:52| sit down there and say yea or nay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1372.0)|
| 0:22:56| And I don't know the answer and how to get around that, and I don't know why it got transferred to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1376.0)|
| 0:23:04| Anything to do with the state is just bureaucratic mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1384.0)|
| 0:23:13| Commissioner Schoonmaker says we're the only county in the state that did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1393.0)|
| 0:23:18| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1398.0)|
| 0:23:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1399.0)|
| 0:23:20| In other words, the state of Tennessee allowed the Knox County Health Department to do their inspections for them under a contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1400.0)|
| 0:23:27| but we were the only county in Tennessee that did it, and that's why they took it back over under their wings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1407.0)|
| 0:23:35| Am I correct, Kathy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1415.0)|
| 0:23:40| It's new to me, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1420.0)|
| 0:23:41| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1421.0)|
| 0:23:42| That's what I understood from talking to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1422.0)|
| 0:23:44| I don't think any of it's new until it just hit you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1424.0)|
| 0:23:46| Yeah, just to happen, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1426.0)|
| 0:23:49| Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1429.0)|
| 0:23:50| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1430.0)|
| 0:23:51| Whenever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1431.0)|
| 0:23:52| I have a question for Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1432.0)|
| 0:23:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1434.0)|
| 0:23:56| Mr. Daly, do you have a suggestion or a recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1436.0)|
| 0:23:59| Well, Mr. Moyer said that we could go ahead if that comes up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1439.0)|
| 0:24:03| He thinks that we, according to our ordinance, we can't approve the beer permit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1443.0)|
| 0:24:08| and it's up to the state to go out and do the inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1448.0)|
| 0:24:12| If we approve the beer permit, the sale can go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1452.0)|
| 0:24:16| Then if the state goes out, which sounds like we need to try to get it back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1456.0)|
| 0:24:21| if the sale goes through and inspection fails, it's on the new owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1461.0)|
| 0:24:27| The new owner has got the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1467.0)|
| 0:24:29| It's up to him to repair or whatever they've got to do at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1469.0)|
| 0:24:34| They're not going to close on the sale without that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1474.0)|
| 0:24:40| They're not going to close on the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1480.0)|
| 0:24:43| And I can understand why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1483.0)|
| 0:24:45| I wouldn't want to buy a piece of property that is now selling beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1485.0)|
| 0:24:50| just because I have to purchase it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1490.0)|
| 0:24:53| and then turn around and wait for an inspection that may or may not pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1493.0)|
| 0:24:57| I need to know that up front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1497.0)|
| 0:24:59| And that's only fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1499.0)|
| 0:25:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1501.0)|
| 0:25:02| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1502.0)|
| 0:25:04| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1504.0)|
| 0:25:05| So, in other words, it was a contingency sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1505.0)|
| 0:25:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1511.0)|
| 0:25:15| But if we issue a beer permit to somebody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1515.0)|
| 0:25:19| is it the state doesn't want to come out till they actually own that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1519.0)|
| 0:25:23| Yep, that's what we were told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1523.0)|
| 0:25:24| That's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1524.0)|
| 0:25:25| They have to own the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1525.0)|
| 0:25:26| Yeah, I can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1526.0)|
| 0:25:27| I can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1527.0)|
| 0:25:28| I don't know if the chair's office knows anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1528.0)|
| 0:25:30| Probably not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1530.0)|
| 0:25:32| Yeah, that's what I was told.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1532.0)|
| 0:25:33| So that's what Mr. Moyers is looking into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1533.0)|
| 0:25:36| And it sounds like if we can get it back, we're better off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1536.0)|
| 0:25:40| And it's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1540.0)|
| 0:25:41| You know, does the state do convenience stores that sell food?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1541.0)|
| 0:25:44| Or health department does restaurants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1544.0)|
| 0:25:47| Or, you know, which is which?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1547.0)|
| 0:25:49| And who determines which is which?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1549.0)|
| 0:25:51| It's confusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1551.0)|
| 0:25:54| Yeah, because the state can't then issue it to the former owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1554.0)|
| 0:25:58| and then have that transferred, I don't think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1558.0)|
| 0:26:00| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1560.0)|
| 0:26:03| The health department still goes in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1563.0)|
| 0:26:05| has jurisdiction over the eating establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1565.0)|
| 0:26:09| I mean, there's no question about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1569.0)|
| 0:26:13| They can pass or not pass or close down an eating establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1573.0)|
| 0:26:19| That's strictly within the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1579.0)|
| 0:26:22| Madam Chair, I suggest you put that on the agenda next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1582.0)|
| 0:26:25| We'll have Mr. Moyers, the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1585.0)|
| 0:26:28| tends to research and see what we can do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1588.0)|
| 0:26:30| But we can't hold a business up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1590.0)|
| 0:26:33| I'd be happy to do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1593.0)|
| 0:26:35| and understand that you have already talked with Mr. Moyers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1595.0)|
| 0:26:39| and so he is aware that this is information that we will be looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1599.0)|
| 0:26:43| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1603.0)|
| 0:26:44| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1604.0)|
| 0:26:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1605.0)|
| 0:26:46| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1606.0)|
| 0:26:47| We can certainly do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1607.0)|
| 0:26:50| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1610.0)|
| 0:26:52| Seeing none, there are no further items on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1612.0)|
| 0:26:57| I call for adjournment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-230717-beer-board_202307?start=1617.0)|
