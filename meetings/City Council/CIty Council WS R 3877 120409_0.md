| 0:00:00| Councilman Brown. Here. Councilman Kampen. Present. Councilman Della Vopi. Here. Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=0)|
| 0:00:08| Greve. Here. Councilman Palmer. Here. Vice Mayor Pavlis. Here. Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=8)|
| 0:00:14| Here. Councilman Steyer. Here. Councilman Wallace. Here. Alright, we'll have the invocation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=14)|
| 0:00:22| by Councilman Brown and then the pledge by Councilman Saunders. My heads and a word of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=22)|
| 0:00:29| prayer. Dear Father, we thank you for this, another beautiful day that you have made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=29)|
| 0:00:36| Thank you for the opportunity to come and participate in trying to do the best that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=36)|
| 0:00:41| we can in the governance of this city. Ask a special blessing upon each and every person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=41)|
| 0:00:48| assembled here tonight. We ask that you would go and be with those who are less fortunate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=48)|
| 0:00:55| Please another blessing we ask in thy name. Amen. Amen. Please face the flag and render| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=55)|
| 0:01:01| the salute. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=61)|
| 0:01:08| republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=68)|
| 0:01:14| for all. I will recognize Mayor O'Hara. Good evening, Council. Good evening. We are pleased| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=74)|
| 0:01:32| to be here tonight to assist you in your deliberations on the pension plan. As I talked about, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=92)|
| 0:01:42| can't even remember now when it was, when the task force came back and we told Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=102)|
| 0:01:47| that we would start looking at some details, that we would start putting together some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=107)|
| 0:01:52| ideas so that to initiate discussion. And one of the things that we hope that the media| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=112)|
| 0:01:58| and the public will remember is that we really have two issues here. One is how we fund the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=118)|
| 0:02:04| current plan that we have. And the other one is how we move forward for future employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=124)|
| 0:02:10| And really those are two different discussions. They interrelate, but if we're going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=130)|
| 0:02:17| on the ballot in November for any potential changes to the charter, then we really need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=137)|
| 0:02:22| to focus on what those changes might be. The current situation is something we'll be dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=142)|
| 0:02:28| with for a number of years. So what we have presented to you, as y'all are going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=148)|
| 0:02:33| into detail about, are some various scenarios based on certain assumptions, all of which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=153)|
| 0:02:37| can be questions and change. But there is one approach to start to talk about and get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=157)|
| 0:02:43| your arms around this topic. So that's all I have to say tonight. We're looking forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=163)|
| 0:02:48| to the discussion. I know there will be many more hours of discussion even after tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| Thank you. I'll recognize Bill Lyons. Thank you, Vice Mayor and Council. We're here, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=173)|
| 0:03:01| Mayor O'Hara said, to put a lot on the table before you and to hopefully structure the material| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=181)|
| 0:03:08| in such a way that it can bear a lot of fruit in your deliberations and your discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| We're very much, at this point, Council is then heavily involved and it's really up to us to find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=193)|
| 0:03:20| the right balance of administration and Council in handling this and working to support what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=200)|
| 0:03:25| Council does. And we want to be very sensitive to the fact that we recognize this is Council's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=205)|
| 0:03:29| workshop. We're here to facilitate your work in pursuing this issue. I'm just going to make a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=209)|
| 0:03:34| couple of remarks before turning it over to Alan, who is going to go through in detail a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=214)|
| 0:03:40| the material that we provided to you about a week ago. Just as a brief bit of background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=220)|
| 0:03:47| and as to what our approach has been and why it's been this way, as you know, the Pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=227)|
| 0:03:52| Task Force, Council's Pension Task Force, reported that their finding was that the pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=232)|
| 0:03:58| in its present form was not sustainable. At that point, they indicated that we should consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=238)|
| 0:04:06| alternatives. They didn't have the capacity to flesh out those alternatives. And Mayor O'Hara,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=246)|
| 0:04:11| immediately following that report, told Council and the public at Council meeting that we would pursue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=251)|
| 0:04:20| finding alternatives that ranged all the way across the board of the way that you can deal with pensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=260)|
| 0:04:26| fully from a full defined benefit plan on one hand to a full defined contribution on the other with two or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=266)|
| 0:04:33| three or a few hybrid plans, combination plans that could be put together in different ways in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=273)|
| 0:04:38| And that's what we have done. And you have had a lot of the material that outlines those plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=278)|
| 0:04:46| their benefits and the way they're funded and where the risk is. And what we've thought useful in that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=286)|
| 0:04:53| narrative that we provided to you last week along with the tables and the presentation was really to help what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=293)|
| 0:05:00| thought was a good way to structure thinking about this, which is number one, what are in fact the benefits that are in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=300)|
| 0:05:08| the pension plan? What are they? What are the commitments to those? And how are those paid for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=308)|
| 0:05:17| The second thing, other than the level of benefits, and most important really we think to help guide the discussion is once those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=317)|
| 0:05:24| benefits are laid out, what is the level of risk and who bears the risk, the market risk? We're talking about market risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=324)|
| 0:05:32| Ranging on one hand to where in a pure defined benefit plan the employee has certainty. The employee knows what his or her pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=332)|
| 0:05:41| will be. That's set by formula and can be computed as it is now in the plan that we have. On the other end, but the city has no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=341)|
| 0:05:53| certainty. The city bears the risk because that is funded by investments and market performance. So on the one end, the employee has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=353)|
| 0:06:01| certainty. The city bears 100 percent of the risk. Conversely, on the defined contribution plan, the city has certainty. That is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=361)|
| 0:06:09| certain amount is paid to the employee on a regular basis. That commitment is made. That's why it's called obviously defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=369)|
| 0:06:18| And then the performance of that later, that risk is on the employee and that will yield whatever the market does over a long period of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=378)|
| 0:06:27| time. And people can make general guidelines on both for the city on defined benefit and guidelines for the employee on defined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=387)|
| 0:06:35| contribution. But in one case, there's certainty for the employee. In the other case, there's certainty to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=395)|
| 0:06:41| We've also presented a number of hybrids that share that risk. There's not total certainty in either case. The employee bears some risk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=401)|
| 0:06:49| based on what the market does. The city bears some risk to what its obligation to fund those plans based on what the market does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=409)|
| 0:06:56| Mayor O'Hara has put out as a preference to begin discussion, working from a hybrid plan that sets the commitment of the city to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=416)|
| 0:07:09| first X amount of dollars paid into that to any employee's salary. That is an employee, in this case, up to $40,000 every, to that point, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=429)|
| 0:07:20| city bears all the risk, makes a commitment for the outcome. As you get higher and higher, then the employee subsumes more and more of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=440)|
| 0:07:26| market risk. And I think there are reasons for that that are fairly evident in terms of equity and the ability to afford to bear that market| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=446)|
| 0:07:34| risk. I'm not going to get any more into detail. Just saying that that is the way we thought framing this discussion would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=454)|
| 0:07:41| Council is free to frame it other ways or pursue in other areas and avenues of interest. We think those include in our thinking about it and in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=461)|
| 0:07:49| administration. And not only the financial elements of this, that's one thing, and that's the way most of this is framed, but also recognizing there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=469)|
| 0:07:58| concerns with retention and recruitment of employees that enter the discussion, its impact on future employees and the city's ability to get good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=478)|
| 0:08:09| employees and keep them. And then the last consideration, obviously, is our equity considerations and fairness considerations. So all three of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=489)|
| 0:08:18| entered our deliberations, but the dominant thing right now, obviously, is what will drive most of this at the beginning are the overriding financial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=498)|
| 0:08:26| considerations. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Alan Pennington, who we've worked with. And let me just say a word. Alan has been very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=506)|
| 0:08:35| responsive. Megan Turow is with here, his assistant, in answering questions and helping us structure these. And our understanding at the administration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=515)|
| 0:08:44| was he would continue to be able to, what we said, was tweak these somewhat in response to what council might want to see in terms of some adjustments or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=524)|
| 0:08:51| others might want to see. Our understanding was when retaining Alan was he would prepare all these and they would be available for some degree of what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=531)|
| 0:08:59| we've called tweaking. We haven't really said exactly how far that would go, but obviously we thought there were some limits upon what would be reasonable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| and allow us to function effectively. So I'm going to turn it over to Alan, who's going to make a presentation and basically we'll elaborate on a lot of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=546)|
| 0:09:14| tables and material that he presented to you. And then I'll turn it over to our vice mayor as to how to structure discussion and all that afterwards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=554)|
| 0:09:20| and we'll sort of step back. Yeah, well, before Mr. Pennington starts, I think it would probably be best unless council really feels strongly in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=560)|
| 0:09:28| another way that we hear the presentation, you know, formulate your questions as he speaks and what have you, and then, you know, start our discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=568)|
| 0:09:38| questions, whatever, after his presentation. Is everybody agreeable with that? Does this seem to work? Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=578)|
| 0:09:45| Thank you very much. As long as it's we might need clarification on what something meant because it's in technical terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=585)|
| 0:09:52| Well, let's. So, Elaine, what you mean? Okay, but let's do that at the end because if we do it, I mean, we'll never, I don't know that we'll get through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=592)|
| 0:10:00| Okay. I bet. Very good. Again, my name is Alan Pennington. I'm the pension actuary for the Knoxville Pension System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=600)|
| 0:10:08| Have been the consulting actuary since 2001 and have been working with the Knoxville Pension System on and off since 1990.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=608)|
| 0:10:16| So, it's been my pleasure to have that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| And most recently, my pleasure to work with the mayor and with Dr. Lyons and Mr. Maness to work on these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=620)|
| 0:10:29| And I wanted to thank them and thank you very much for the opportunity to be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=629)|
| 0:10:33| Obviously, we won't get all your questions answered tonight, but I'll be working diligently with you through Dr. Lyons to hopefully get all of your answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=633)|
| 0:10:45| all your questions answered methodically and quickly as best as I can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| So, with that said, I hope everybody has two different handouts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| One you just got tonight that you have not seen before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| This is a PowerPoint presentation that I'm going to incorporate into my comments tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| So, if I refer to the PowerPoint, this is the one I'm referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| The other one is the one that I hope you got in the mail about or in the e-mail about a week ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| This is a PDF file that has several nine pages in it that covers various different aspects of the plan design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=676)|
| 0:11:24| So, yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=684)|
| 0:11:29| You don't have this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=689)|
| 0:11:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=691)|
| 0:11:32| Megan, can you help me out here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=692)|
| 0:11:37| Just take those up and see if anybody else needs one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=697)|
| 0:11:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| While Megan is helping hand those out, I am going to start with the PDF file that I believe you've had an opportunity to see already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=705)|
| 0:12:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=724)|
| 0:12:20| Thanks, Megan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| If you'll look in the PDF file, which is the one that you've had already on page one, you'll see a 30-year cost projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=742)|
| 0:12:32| This first page does not reflect any of the plan design considerations that we'll be looking at tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=752)|
| 0:12:41| This is a projection of what might happen over the next 30 years under the current plan provisions under either A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=761)|
| 0:12:50| the scenario where we get 7 3 8 percent return per year for the next 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=770)|
| 0:12:55| 7 3 8 is the current valuation assumption that was recently adopted by the pension board previously down from 8 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=775)|
| 0:13:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=785)|
| 0:13:06| So 7 3 8 is the most recent change that we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| That line is the lower of the two lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=789)|
| 0:13:13| If over the next 30 years, let's say a more conservative asset policy was adopted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=793)|
| 0:13:19| and instead of getting 7 3 8, we got 6 1⁄2 percent return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| If we get 6 1⁄2 percent return, lower return, higher contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=804)|
| 0:13:29| because benefits are essentially being paid for by a combination of the investment return, city contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=809)|
| 0:13:35| and the employee contributions, which are, of course, fixed at 6 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=815)|
| 0:13:38| and they will also be fixed in all the scenarios that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=818)|
| 0:13:42| So this at least gives you a little bit of bracket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=822)|
| 0:13:46| It's not to say the contribution couldn't be less than that if the returns are higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=826)|
| 0:13:50| or that the contribution couldn't be higher than that if the returns are lower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=830)|
| 0:13:53| but I think that gives you some reasonable expectation of what might happen over the next, you know, 20, 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=833)|
| 0:14:02| Before we start looking at any other scenarios, is there any – well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=842)|
| 0:14:07| do you want everybody to just hold questions until the end?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=849)|
| 0:14:10| So if anybody has questions, we can go back and refer to this if you need any clarification on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=850)|
| 0:14:16| Does he have a plot of the 8 percent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=856)|
| 0:14:23| I do not have a plot of the 8 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| If that is something that's desired, I can certainly put that together in response to, I'm sure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=865)|
| 0:14:30| many other questions which will be coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=870)|
| 0:14:32| Assume it's below the two lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=872)|
| 0:14:34| That would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=874)|
| 0:14:40| Based on the experience study, based on input from summit strategies, based on historical returns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=880)|
| 0:14:46| seven and three-eighths is what the current expectation is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=886)|
| 0:14:51| That's not to say it couldn't be 8 percent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| but that's no longer believed based on input from our investment advisor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=893)|
| 0:14:58| and other information that I put together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| Eight percent is no longer consistent with what our long-term expectations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=901)|
| 0:15:08| Looking at the PowerPoint presentation that I handed out, you should have gotten this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=908)|
| 0:15:21| Here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=921)|
| 0:15:23| This focuses on an explanation of the various plan design options that are currently under consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=923)|
| 0:15:33| That is not to say that the provisions that you're going to see explained here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=933)|
| 0:15:38| are what we are now recommending that one of those should be chosen for the ballot in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| All we're saying is that this is a structure to start discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=943)|
| 0:15:47| So I'm sure there are going to be questions to come back to say, can we tweak this assumption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=947)|
| 0:15:51| Can we change that assumption?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=951)|
| 0:15:53| If we change this, what does it do to cost projections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=953)|
| 0:15:56| Those are things that are going to be going on, I'm sure, over the next several weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=956)|
| 0:15:59| and perhaps a couple months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=959)|
| 0:16:01| So, you know, if you see any one particular plan provision that you're not satisfied with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=961)|
| 0:16:06| I'm sure I'll be getting feedback from you as well as feedback from the employee representatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=966)|
| 0:16:10| So I would ask that you just look at this as a framework within which we can begin our discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=970)|
| 0:16:18| On page two of this presentation, you see the plan design alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=978)|
| 0:16:23| We have the current defined benefit plan at the top, so, you know, if we just stick with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=983)|
| 0:16:28| that's going to be one of the different projections we're going to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| There's five other ones ranging, as Dr. Lyons indicated, from a full defined benefit plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=992)|
| 0:16:38| the modified current DV plan, where all of the market risk would continue to stay with the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=998)|
| 0:16:45| and the city would be responsible to make up any investment returns below which our current assumption is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1005)|
| 0:16:53| We have three hybrid alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| All three of the hybrids share the market risk between the city and between the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| And what I mean by that is if there are higher returns than expected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1022)|
| 0:17:07| that means the city contribution is going to be relatively less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1027)|
| 0:17:12| It also means that the benefit for the employees could be relatively larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1032)|
| 0:17:17| On the other hand, if the returns that we see under these hybrid plans are less than expected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1037)|
| 0:17:25| that means the city's contribution is going to be higher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1045)|
| 0:17:28| and then the benefits to the employees would be relatively lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| So there's some shared risk in those three hybrid scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| In the D.C. only scenario, all of the market risk in that scenario would be on the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1055)|
| 0:17:42| Any high returns benefits the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1062)|
| 0:17:45| Any low returns is to the detriment of the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1065)|
| 0:17:49| So we're looking sort of at a full range of options here for the council's consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1069)|
| 0:17:57| Under the modified current D.B. plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1077)|
| 0:18:01| we've taken all the provisions of the current plan G1 and G2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1081)|
| 0:18:07| and then we've looked at the current Division C for fire and police,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1087)|
| 0:18:12| and we've said let's increase the normal retirement age to 65 as our starting point in general government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| and 57 in the fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| Reduce the COLA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1101)|
| 0:18:23| The cost of living adjustment currently is set at a minimum of 3% and can go up to 4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1103)|
| 0:18:28| Under this scenario, it would be a 0 to 3% based on the CPI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1108)|
| 0:18:34| So it might be between 2 and 3 a lot, but it would be capped at a 3% maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1114)|
| 0:18:40| The current drop plan, deferred retirement option plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1120)|
| 0:18:45| would not be available in any of these scenarios as we have them currently provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1125)|
| 0:18:52| The current final average pay is a two-year final average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| Under the proposed design options, it would be a five-year final average pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1136)|
| 0:19:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1142)|
| 0:19:03| And that's true not only under the modified current,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1143)|
| 0:19:07| but in each one of these other alternatives, if it says hybrid at the top of the page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1147)|
| 0:19:12| the DB plan also reflects these same retirement age, reduce COLA, drop, no drop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1152)|
| 0:19:20| and the five-year final average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1160)|
| 0:19:21| So even though I'm not repeating these provisions on every page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1161)|
| 0:19:24| these provisions also apply to the hybrid plans as well as to this modified current DB plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1164)|
| 0:19:33| Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1174)|
| 0:19:35| I really do think that we have to have a clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| We're never going to get back through all this stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1177)|
| 0:19:39| I just want to ask you if average pay is base pay, is it overtime pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1179)|
| 0:19:43| What are you talking about when you say average pay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| I have not assumed any change to the definition of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| So the current definition would continue to be applicable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1189)|
| 0:19:52| It would just be a five-year average instead of a two-year average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1192)|
| 0:19:55| Current definition, base pay or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| To be honest, I don't know if it's just base pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| I'd have to go back and look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1201)|
| 0:20:07| It's all pay, not just base pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1207)|
| 0:20:08| All pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1210)|
| 0:20:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| Again, just to reemphasize, all these plan design options that we're looking at here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| we are not proposing them for current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| Any of the design options that are under consideration would be for new employees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1226)|
| 0:20:30| that enter after a given date, whether that's July 1, 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1230)|
| 0:20:34| or whatever that date ends up being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| But we are not talking at this point about any changes for current employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| just to reemphasize that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| Mr. Vice Chairman, you might note that Mr. Cherry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1244)|
| 0:20:47| the Executive Director of the Pension Board, is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1247)|
| 0:20:50| So some of these questions may need to go to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1250)|
| 0:20:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| Do we want to change the format?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1257)|
| 0:21:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1263)|
| 0:21:04| I just got a revised comment, base plus longevity pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| No overtime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1273)|
| 0:21:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1278)|
| 0:21:19| On the general government, the first hybrid option, the DBDC Basic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1279)|
| 0:21:26| this is made up of two components, a defined benefit plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1286)|
| 0:21:29| which would provide 1.35% five-year final average pay time service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1289)|
| 0:21:34| as a monthly benefit payable beginning at age 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1294)|
| 0:21:38| In addition to that defined benefit component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| there will also be a defined contribution account, much like the current G1 account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1302)|
| 0:21:47| if you're familiar with G1, where there's a 3% employee contribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| a 1.5% city contribution, and then whatever that account accumulates to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1312)|
| 0:21:58| would also be payable to the member at retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1318)|
| 0:22:04| That amount also in the DC account is available as an annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| Our experience has been most people take that as a lump sum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| We haven't seen many people actually take the annuity option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1331)|
| 0:22:14| but it is available as an annuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| Under the second hybrid option, the DBDC Plus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1340)|
| 0:22:26| there's a defined benefit component that pays 2% of final average pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1346)|
| 0:22:30| five-year final average pay time service at age 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1350)|
| 0:22:35| In addition, well, that base defined benefit amount only uses pay capped at $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1355)|
| 0:22:45| So if somebody is making less than $40,000 a year when they retire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1365)|
| 0:22:49| then they get all of their pay included in this defined benefit calculation, in this formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| If they're making $50,000, $60,000, only up to $40,000 is used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| But if they're making more than $40,000, they also get a defined contribution account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1381)|
| 0:23:10| where they have a 6% employee contribution applied to pay in excess of $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1390)|
| 0:23:17| So if they're making $50,000 a year, then they get a 6% of $10,000 would go in for their city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1397)|
| 0:23:24| and for their employee contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| And then the employer contribution would be 8%, again, of that excess pay, pay over $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1406)|
| 0:23:34| In this way, a higher paid individual still has the base DB amount,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1414)|
| 0:23:40| but they also have a variable DC account based on their compensation in excess of $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1420)|
| 0:23:47| So the people that are making lower compensation are not taking any risk or taking relatively less risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1427)|
| 0:23:56| People that are making higher compensation would be taking relatively more risk in terms of the future investment returns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1436)|
| 0:24:03| because the DC component would just pay whatever that account balance is at retirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1443)|
| 0:24:16| The third hybrid option, sharing the risk between the employee and the employer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1456)|
| 0:24:23| is what we're calling the DBDCmax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1463)|
| 0:24:28| The DB component is the same as the second hybrid, 2% of pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1468)|
| 0:24:39| five-year final average earnings times service at age 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1479)|
| 0:24:44| However, in this plan design option, if the DC account balance, which is based on total pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1484)|
| 0:24:53| so now you've got 6% contributions of your total pay, base plus longevity, plus an 8% city contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1493)|
| 0:25:01| If that account balance produces a bigger annuity than the 2% of pay formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1501)|
| 0:25:07| then you get the benefit based on your DC account balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1507)|
| 0:25:12| So if your account balance does well or does very well, even if you're making $40,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1512)|
| 0:25:18| you might still get a bigger benefit than that 2% of pay base benefit formula.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1518)|
| 0:25:26| So if you work 30 years and you're making $40,000 a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| you'd be looking at 60% of final average pay at retirement or $24,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1530)|
| 0:25:36| If your DC account balance produces a bigger benefit than $24,000 a year, you get that bigger benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1536)|
| 0:25:47| Now, if you're making $50,000 a year, your defined benefit portion is still $24,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1547)|
| 0:25:53| because it's still based on a cap of $40,000, but your defined contribution account is not capped at $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1553)|
| 0:26:00| So in that scenario, you might expect a benefit of $28,000 a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1560)|
| 0:26:05| if you met all of your investment return assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| So in that case, again, we're putting less investment risk on the lower paid folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1569)|
| 0:26:15| more investment risk on the higher paid folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1575)|
| 0:26:18| So the higher paid folks have the ability to get a similar percentage of pay at retirement, but it's not guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1578)|
| 0:26:26| But everybody still has that base benefit of 2% of final average pay limited to $40,000 a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1586)|
| 0:26:44| The fifth option now goes all the way over to all investment risk sits on the employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1604)|
| 0:26:50| with a full defined contribution plan for the general government at 6% employee contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1610)|
| 0:27:00| 8% city contributions, whatever the account balance is, is what it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1620)|
| 0:27:06| and the city is not taking any investment risk under this option, again, for new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1626)|
| 0:27:15| Now, these five options that I've just talked through, we have the same five options under the fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1635)|
| 0:27:23| The provisions are a bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| The retirement age is 57 instead of 65.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| The multiplier is a little different than one of the options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1648)|
| 0:27:34| But they work essentially the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1654)|
| 0:27:41| At this time, do you want me to walk through, Mr. Pavlis, the fire and police options?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1661)|
| 0:27:46| Go ahead and walk through those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1667)|
| 0:27:48| Mr. Chairman, I beg permission to ask a minor question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| Compound the confusion if we go through the same thing not knowing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| In your mixed DBDC options, does the city pay the entire defined benefit with no contribution from the employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1677)|
| 0:28:06| and it's only in the variable account that the employee kicks in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1686)|
| 0:28:09| In the case of the DBDC, well, it's different for each one, I guess, is the short answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1689)|
| 0:28:14| So shall I walk through each one and explain it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| You said 2% pretty much across the board was the, well, 1.35 and then 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| Who's 2%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1702)|
| 0:28:24| The employees pay 6% regardless in all the scenarios, and the city would pay any additional cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1704)|
| 0:28:31| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1711)|
| 0:28:32| That's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| May I proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1717)|
| 0:28:38| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1719)|
| 0:28:40| Under the fire and police, the first option under the fire and police is the modified current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1720)|
| 0:28:49| It has the age 57, normal retirement age under this initial proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1729)|
| 0:28:56| The reduced COLA is zero to three, removing the drop, and five-year final average pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1736)|
| 0:29:01| So very similar in the general government and the fire and police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1741)|
| 0:29:08| In the first hybrid plan under fire and police, the DBDC basic, you have a separate DB component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1748)|
| 0:29:16| 1.15% of pay times five-year final average time service at 57,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| and the DC account mirrors the account in the general government for the DBDC basic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1761)|
| 0:29:28| 3% of the employee contributions, 1.5% of city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1768)|
| 0:29:33| In this scenario, you've got 3% going into the DB plan and 3% into the DC plan, so the employees are paying 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1773)|
| 0:29:41| Very similar to the general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1781)|
| 0:29:44| On the fire and police, DBDC+, again, very, very similar to the general government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1784)|
| 0:29:49| except we have an age 57 retirement age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1789)|
| 0:29:54| and actually the DBDC account in the fire and police should be 6% and 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1794)|
| 0:30:02| That's a typo on that page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1802)|
| 0:30:04| It should be 6% and 10% under the DBDC+,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| but otherwise works the same way as the general government DBDC+.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1808)|
| 0:30:17| The DBDCmax likewise works the same way as the general government, age 57 normal retirement age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1817)|
| 0:30:25| 6% employee contributions, 10% city in the DC account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1825)|
| 0:30:36| And the DC only, same except 6% employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1841)|
| 0:30:42| 6% employee, 10% city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| So I won't go through as much detail on the fire and police| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| as they operate pretty much the same way as the general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| Now, with this presentation, that really gets us through page two of the PDF handout that you already had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1856)|
| 0:31:08| You may have several other questions from that PDF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1868)|
| 0:31:11| We've already covered a lot of information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1871)|
| 0:31:13| I think it's very important to understand what we've covered at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| So, Mr. Chairperson, if it would be okay to allow persons to ask questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| if we can try to limit it to this material for right now, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1883)|
| 0:31:27| Councilman DelVofior, recognize before your light goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1887)|
| 0:31:31| You anticipated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| Well, I guess I'm questioning about the starting point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| Every one of the scenarios you just outlined deals with employees hired somewhere after November 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1897)|
| 0:31:45| You even mentioned July 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| That sounds like about 100 to 150 people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| We've got 1,600 employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| We've got 2,300 retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| You're proposing nothing as affects those existing employees in all these scenarios you've gone through?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1918)|
| 0:32:05| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| And you're tackling a $20-plus million problem by addressing pensions related to 100 people that will be starting out at age 25 or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1927)|
| 0:32:18| Let me break in here, if I could, Councilman DelVofior.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| Our understanding, and basically our discussion with Mr. Pennington from the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| was to respect the Blackwell Supreme Court decision that was made in the 80s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1946)|
| 0:32:31| in which the Tennessee Supreme Court, according to most interpretations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1951)|
| 0:32:35| and there's an attorney general opinion rendered on this also,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1955)|
| 0:32:38| was that the obligations for people once they were vested could not be altered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1958)|
| 0:32:47| And there was some question about whether even it was prior to vesting that that was a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1967)|
| 0:32:54| I'm not the person to get into any legal background on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1974)|
| 0:32:57| but basically that was seen as an obligation and that, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| it was Shelby County could not change any pensions for any employees who were vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1982)|
| 0:33:07| That's a Tennessee Supreme Court decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1987)|
| 0:33:10| and that's why that has guided our pursuit of the remedies and looking to just change this for new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1990)|
| 0:33:19| And your opinion includes the fact that you can't alter COLA, you can't alter retirement age,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=1999)|
| 0:33:24| you can't alter employee contributions or anything for an existing employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2004)|
| 0:33:28| even though it might make the system actuarially sound and help it survive and pay the employee benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2008)|
| 0:33:35| I'm just referring to the Blackwell decision saying that all of those things you named were things that could not be altered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2015)|
| 0:33:41| I guess they could be potentially with the acquiescence of every single employee who had signed on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2021)|
| 0:33:47| but it's a very far-reaching decision that does say just what you just articulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2027)|
| 0:33:52| So the option is to go bankrupt or to raise taxes or to cut services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2032)|
| 0:33:56| Is that the position you're taking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| I'm just repeating what the Blackwell decision had.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| I'm not taking a position, but I tend to take Supreme Court decisions pretty seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2041)|
| 0:34:07| They depend on their facts, but that's all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2047)|
| 0:34:13| Any more questions, Melissa?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2053)|
| 0:34:15| I guess I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2055)|
| 0:34:16| Hold on one second, Melissa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2056)|
| 0:34:18| Yeah, I had a question on the different scenarios that you proposed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| What is the vesting on these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| Right now we have five-year vesting in the G1, G2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2064)|
| 0:34:28| For the initial discussions, we have assumed vesting remains at five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2068)|
| 0:34:32| I've heard a couple suggestions that it might be considered to use ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2072)|
| 0:34:36| but that has not been reflected in any of these scenarios to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| And there would be a variance between the two scenarios if there was five-year vesting or ten-year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2081)|
| 0:34:48| The cost implications between five-year and ten-year are not particularly significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| The significance would be if you wanted to come back later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2093)|
| 0:34:56| and decided you wanted to change some benefit structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2096)|
| 0:34:59| you can change it for non-vested employees, again referring back to the Blackwell decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| so you end up having a longer period within which if you decide, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2103)|
| 0:35:08| you really didn't mean to do that or you wanted to change something, you actually could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2108)|
| 0:35:12| And do you know, or does anyone here know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2112)|
| 0:35:15| how many of the current existing employees on the payroll are not vested right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2115)|
| 0:35:22| Mike Cherry might know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2122)|
| 0:35:30| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2130)|
| 0:35:34| Of the total number of folks that are currently active as of July 1, 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2134)|
| 0:35:42| which was just under 1,500 people, 365 were non-vested at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2142)|
| 0:35:49| Now, some of the people probably have become vested since July 1 of last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2149)|
| 0:35:53| but at that time, 365 members in the system had not yet become vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2153)|
| 0:35:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2158)|
| 0:35:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2159)|
| 0:36:00| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2160)|
| 0:36:02| Councilman Stager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2164)|
| 0:36:06| Mr. Pennington, when I look at page one of this employee contribution projection, you know, I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2166)|
| 0:36:13| just to me this just seems like enormous, just a complete disaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2173)|
| 0:36:18| Is there a short version on how this happened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| So prior to that year, if you were looking at the projected contribution was around zero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2184)|
| 0:36:35| It wasn't zero, but it was much more, much less than what you're seeing in that scenario, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2195)|
| 0:36:42| Because originally it would be designed to oscillate around zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2202)|
| 0:36:45| No, no, no, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| It would originally be designed to oscillate about, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2207)|
| 0:36:50| the ongoing cost of benefits accruing each year might be on average, let's say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2210)|
| 0:36:56| 11% of pay between the fire and police and the general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| So if we met all of our assumptions, we met our seven and three-eighths or 8%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2221)|
| 0:37:05| or whatever that assumption was, and retirements, turnovers, deaths, all that stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2225)|
| 0:37:10| we would expect long-term, even if there's no changes, to put in, let's say, 11, 12% of pay every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2230)|
| 0:37:19| And to the extent you have gains and losses, it would oscillate around that 12%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2239)|
| 0:37:25| And in terms of percent, I mean, we're looking out five or ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| When you're getting into the city having to contribute 25 to 35 million out of a budget of 170 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2249)|
| 0:37:38| what is that percentage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2258)|
| 0:37:41| I mean, currently we're the projection is, what, $13 million for the upcoming fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2261)|
| 0:37:48| The payroll is 65 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2268)|
| 0:37:51| So we're already approaching 20% in the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2271)|
| 0:37:57| Within ten years, you know, that could be 40% of pay, 35%, 40% of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2277)|
| 0:38:05| With, you know, that's probably what those numbers you're looking at represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2285)|
| 0:38:09| I don't have the percentage of pay, but I can certainly get those for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2289)|
| 0:38:17| And this, I mean, and the thing about the market, I mean, the market was down, but it seems like it's rebounded,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2297)|
| 0:38:23| but it hasn't rebounded enough to affect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| It's rebounded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| We had very, very good returns in the year ending June 30, 2011, and June 30, 2010.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2308)|
| 0:38:35| But those rebounds were not near significant enough to wipe out all the losses that we got in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2315)|
| 0:38:41| So we're still relatively behind the eight ball, as it were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2321)|
| 0:38:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2326)|
| 0:38:47| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| Thank you, Mr. Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| Just a brief question about the defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2330)|
| 0:38:57| The portion, whether it's a portion or just that option alone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| have investment options for the employee been discussed, an array of risk and so forth?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2341)|
| 0:39:09| Whatever that is, whatever we settled on, if there is a defined contribution portion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2349)|
| 0:39:15| we've got to flesh that out a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| Actually, if there's a defined contribution, you're talking about the hybrid options now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2358)|
| 0:39:21| Well, a hybrid option or just the straight defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2361)|
| 0:39:25| My thought at this time, and everything is subject to discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2365)|
| 0:39:29| but my thought is in the hybrid plan, just like in the current,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2369)|
| 0:39:34| are you familiar with how the G1 plan works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| Just like in the G1, the city still invests all that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2377)|
| 0:39:41| So the employees are not making investment decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2381)|
| 0:39:43| There's still one pool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| It's allocated to individuals, but they're not making the investment decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2385)|
| 0:39:50| My thought at this time would be if any one of the three hybrid options was used,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2390)|
| 0:39:56| then there would be a similar type structure where there's still one pool of money invested by the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2396)|
| 0:40:01| whether it's summit strategies or whoever the investment managers would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2401)|
| 0:40:05| and then it would be allocated up to the employees as appropriate for whichever the design option was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2405)|
| 0:40:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| Let me try to address some of Councilman Stair's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| And, Alan, you may pitch in and tell me how far off base I am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| As I recall, and I have only looked at this, 2008, I think our assets were around $550 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2421)|
| 0:40:33| At year-end last, when your report was rendered to us as of June 30th, it was $468 million, if I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2433)|
| 0:40:45| That's the market value, not the actuarial value, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2445)|
| 0:40:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2449)|
| 0:40:50| The market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2450)|
| 0:40:51| I'm talking market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2451)|
| 0:40:52| I'm talking market value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2452)|
| 0:40:53| And there's $468 at year-end last.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| As of the end of March, last month, that asset, total asset value, market value, was $462, as I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2456)|
| 0:41:08| Now, keep in mind, the city is making a contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2468)|
| 0:41:13| Employees are making contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2473)|
| 0:41:15| But, of course, we are paying out $40 million plus a year in retirement benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2475)|
| 0:41:23| And when you add all that up, the corpus has not grown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2483)|
| 0:41:27| So the actuarial value, depending on your assumption, if it's 8%, the actuarial value is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2487)|
| 0:41:34| you'd have to add another $127 million, if I recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2494)|
| 0:41:38| Was that the number you used last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2498)|
| 0:41:41| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| Restate the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2502)|
| 0:41:43| The actuarial difference would be about $127 million at 8% assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| The difference between the smooth actuarial asset value and the market value is not a function of the interest rate assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2509)|
| 0:41:59| That is to say, once you get a gain or loss, it is whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2519)|
| 0:42:03| and that gain or loss is smoothed over ten years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2523)|
| 0:42:07| and that's what goes into the calculation of the smoothed asset value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| I understand that, but we're talking about a real value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2530)|
| 0:42:13| In other words, what corpus do we need to have to make sure that it is sound| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2533)|
| 0:42:18| and we are able to fund the benefits that we have promised our employees at whatever time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2538)|
| 0:42:25| And so that is going to be far greater than the market value right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2545)|
| 0:42:32| Well, that number depends, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2552)|
| 0:42:35| That difference is going to depend on your assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| If you lower the assumption to 6.5%, as we see, then our liability rises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2558)|
| 0:42:45| But I would submit that that's a fairly real assumption at 6.5% or perhaps even lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2565)|
| 0:42:54| If you think about market returns now, yes, the market has done pretty well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| but look at our performance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2577)|
| 0:42:59| We have not mirrored the market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2579)|
| 0:43:04| Maybe I read into this question that we hope the market will blunt some of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| and certainly we do, but so far it really hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| Councilman Walz.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2593)|
| 0:43:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2594)|
| 0:43:15| So what is the ten-year average rate of return?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2595)|
| 0:43:21| Now, Alan, last year when you gave us the report, it was 6.01, ten-year average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| That's what I was going to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2607)|
| 0:43:28| I've got that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2608)|
| 0:43:29| Hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2609)|
| 0:43:34| The average rate of return since June 30th, 2002, this is page 37 of the valuation report, is 5.3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2614)|
| 0:43:44| Is that before fees or afterwards?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| That's after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| That's after fees, 5.3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2627)|
| 0:43:49| And let me say that these are estimates that I put together each year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2629)|
| 0:43:53| This is not the, you know, the actual returns coming from the investment manager.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2633)|
| 0:43:58| These are ones that I, you know, assume mid-year cash flows and, you know, net of expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2638)|
| 0:44:04| So, you know, this is not exact to the tenth of a percent, but approximately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2644)|
| 0:44:09| What page was that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2649)|
| 0:44:10| This is on page 37 of the July 1, 2011 valuation report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2650)|
| 0:44:17| So the rate of return is 5.3%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| So why don't we have a graph here that shows 5.3% of what you have ten-year average of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2659)|
| 0:44:25| I mean, do you think those ten years are abnormal or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| Yes, the last ten years have been exceptionally abnormal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| How can you say ten years have been abnormal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2672)|
| 0:44:34| I mean, that's, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2674)|
| 0:44:35| So what, was it over 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2675)|
| 0:44:36| Was it a lot different than that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2676)|
| 0:44:38| I mean, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| It's about 7.85 to 8%, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| If you figure 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2683)|
| 0:44:44| 20 years, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2684)|
| 0:44:45| That's 26%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2685)|
| 0:44:46| It goes up to 7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| 7.3, 7 and I think it was 7.85 or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2687)|
| 0:44:55| So were there discussions after 2008 that said, City of Knoxville, we have a problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2695)|
| 0:45:00| We just lost and we have a, if you all put in, did you all make some suggestions and corrections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2700)|
| 0:45:08| of how this should be corrected back then and they were either ignored or just hadn't been put in place yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2708)|
| 0:45:14| I think Knoxville is in the same situation that a lot of cities and states are all over the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2714)|
| 0:45:20| And I think everybody is, you know, based on their particular situation, analyzing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2720)|
| 0:45:25| and trying to put a plan in place in a methodical way that's going to, you know, not just try to, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2725)|
| 0:45:31| there's no way to Band-Aid patch or get us back to where we were in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2731)|
| 0:45:35| I mean, there's just no way to, there's no quick fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2735)|
| 0:45:37| So, you know, I worked with the former administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| I'm working with this administration to try to come up with some suggestions on things to address the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2741)|
| 0:45:49| and to try to put us in a situation where 2008 is not repeated again, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| We can't undo it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| And there's, you know, nothing we do is going to take those projections that you were looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| and materially decrease the 10-year, 15-year forecast because most of those numbers apply to current employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2764)|
| 0:46:12| not future employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2772)|
| 0:46:13| But the Blackwell decision, you know, to some extent just ties our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| So, would you say, so 2011, you said 2011 is a big year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2778)|
| 0:46:22| What was our rate of return in 2011?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2782)|
| 0:46:26| 24.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| And that was way outpacing the market, was it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2789)|
| 0:46:34| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2794)|
| 0:46:37| The standard and poor one-year average was 30.69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2797)|
| 0:46:43| And you were at 24.6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2803)|
| 0:46:45| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2805)|
| 0:46:46| That's a mix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2806)|
| 0:46:47| We're not 100% in equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2807)|
| 0:46:49| So, you know, bond index was 3.56 for that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2809)|
| 0:46:55| So, I mean, depending on which asset class you're looking at, regardless of how you slice it, the plan did very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2815)|
| 0:47:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2823)|
| 0:47:04| Remember, George, we started from a much lower base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2824)|
| 0:47:08| If I could, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| I mean, I know we've got a lot of things here to talk about the plan design options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2830)|
| 0:47:14| All these issues are really, really good issues to flush out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2834)|
| 0:47:17| And I want to answer everybody's questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2837)|
| 0:47:19| But in light of trying to make sure that we get to this material, we want to try to circle back around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2839)|
| 0:47:25| Let's go ahead with one more question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2845)|
| 0:47:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2847)|
| 0:47:29| I was talking about what he actually went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2849)|
| 0:47:31| And the reference that we were looking at, someone just said 468 million was the rough asset base as of July 1, 2011,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2851)|
| 0:47:45| according to your valuation report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| What is the liability in the same economic terms?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2868)|
| 0:47:51| Is that the 595 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2871)|
| 0:47:54| Or is it the 679 million on page one of your valuation year-end report?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2874)|
| 0:48:00| $595 million represents the value of benefits that have been accrued, that is, for service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2880)|
| 0:48:08| and compensation as of the valuation date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| So is that roughly comparable to the market value of the assets you have as of the valuation date?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2891)|
| 0:48:17| In other words, are they the two numbers you compare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2897)|
| 0:48:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| If those two numbers are the same, then we're fully funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2900)|
| 0:48:22| And then we expect that 11%, 12% of costs going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2902)|
| 0:48:25| But instead they're about 130 million shorter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2907)|
| 0:48:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2908)|
| 0:48:29| Now, going back to the – I still don't know that I understand the charts you went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2909)|
| 0:48:33| In the defined benefit plan, employees, you said, give 6%, or in the combo plans, the DBDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2913)|
| 0:48:42| Is that 6% falling down to the defined contribution, or is that an additional 6%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2922)|
| 0:48:47| No, it's not an additional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2927)|
| 0:48:48| It's a total of 6%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2928)|
| 0:48:49| So 6% of salary is what they pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2929)|
| 0:48:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2931)|
| 0:48:53| And then 6% drops down into their own defined contribution plan, which the city matches with either 8% or 10%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2933)|
| 0:49:01| depending on whether you're general government or police, fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2941)|
| 0:49:05| Is that the way it works?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2945)|
| 0:49:07| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| I mean, depending on which hybrid you're looking at sort of depends on exactly how the exact dollars are broken up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2948)|
| 0:49:14| But at the end of the day, the employee contributes 6%, and then the employer contributes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2954)|
| 0:49:19| the city contributes whatever is necessary to provide the benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2959)|
| 0:49:23| That's the benefit of the $40,000 or whatever cap you had there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2963)|
| 0:49:28| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2968)|
| 0:49:29| For the defined benefit plan, let's just talk about a specific option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| So DC, DBDC plus, the employer is going to contribute to that defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2972)|
| 0:49:40| 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| 100%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2981)|
| 0:49:42| And then, well, actually, the city is going to, that's not correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2982)|
| 0:49:47| because the employees contribute 6% of pay up to $40,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2987)|
| 0:49:51| So if they're making $30,000 a year, all their employee contributions are going into the DB plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2991)|
| 0:49:56| And are they not under the DBDC plus, are they not allowed to be in a defined contribution plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=2996)|
| 0:50:02| Well, I mean, there could be an additional plan that's voluntary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3002)|
| 0:50:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3006)|
| 0:50:07| Yeah, that's not prohibiting that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3007)|
| 0:50:10| It's just that's not an additional cost, so it hasn't been put into the projection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3010)|
| 0:50:13| So that's aside from the savings plan, the 457 savings plan, which they can put money into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3013)|
| 0:50:17| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3017)|
| 0:50:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| And it's only for the people compensated over $40,000 that would have, in that option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3019)|
| 0:50:24| a chance to put money in and have a city match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| I mean, it would be mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| It's not optional for the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3028)|
| 0:50:29| Oh, it's mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3029)|
| 0:50:30| It's mandatory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3030)|
| 0:50:31| That's how the benefits comprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3031)|
| 0:50:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3032)|
| 0:50:33| The 6% is mandatory across the board under any of these options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| One last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3036)|
| 0:50:37| You said there were 365 people, more or less, not vested of the 1,535 currently working employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3037)|
| 0:50:43| Why are you not applying these rules to the 365 as opposed to targeting just the 100 new hires that we might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3043)|
| 0:50:50| or might not have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3050)|
| 0:50:51| I don't understand why you're looking at the smallest base possible to apply the new rules to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3051)|
| 0:50:59| I could address that, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3059)|
| 0:51:02| We made a decision going into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| That was an option, obviously, to have something apply to people who are not yet vested in the first five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3064)|
| 0:51:11| And then you start thinking in terms, again, of fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| If somebody is one, do you do that to somebody who's one year short of being vested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3073)|
| 0:51:17| and create a two-tier system of retirement with some people who came in to the system with an expectation of a certain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3077)|
| 0:51:24| retirement plan having a different plan than those who are one year ahead of them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3084)|
| 0:51:31| We thought at some point you would have to draw a line unless you went right to the very end of to where you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3091)|
| 0:51:36| start applying the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3096)|
| 0:51:37| As we reduced that back to maybe it was in the first couple of years, maybe the first three years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3097)|
| 0:51:42| it would produce a system of one employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3102)|
| 0:51:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| So fairness was your criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3106)|
| 0:51:47| And the next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| Can I address that one too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3109)|
| 0:51:51| Can I address that one too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3111)|
| 0:51:52| One other thing, not just fairness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3112)|
| 0:51:54| You might think 365 people out of 1,500 is a big percentage of liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| But it's not because those non-vested people have the smallest benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3119)|
| 0:52:03| So changing their benefit structure has a relatively smaller impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3123)|
| 0:52:09| It's not 365 out of 1,500 in terms of percentage of liability, in other words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3129)|
| 0:52:14| They represent a much smaller percentage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| They tend to be younger and lower paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3136)|
| 0:52:17| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3137)|
| 0:52:18| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3138)|
| 0:52:19| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3139)|
| 0:52:20| And they met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3140)|
| 0:52:21| And, of course, a lot of those are not going to stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3141)|
| 0:52:22| That's the other thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3142)|
| 0:52:23| I mean, not everybody stays the entire time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3143)|
| 0:52:25| But you're right, Councilman DeLaVolpe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3145)|
| 0:52:26| It was a fairness issue and a practicality issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3146)|
| 0:52:29| And a lack of benefit that would be worth that cost is what led us to say let's focus on new hires| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3149)|
| 0:52:37| who then would know what they were getting into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| I'll defer to the next workshop, how you find the missing $20 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| Please go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3167)|
| 0:52:49| Hey, I'm looking at my $20 billion house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3169)|
| 0:52:52| Yeah, Alan, if you could kick that in, that would help a whole lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3172)|
| 0:52:54| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3174)|
| 0:52:56| No problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3176)|
| 0:52:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3177)|
| 0:52:59| That concludes this PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3179)|
| 0:53:02| So now we're going to turn over to the PDF presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3182)|
| 0:53:16| I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3199)|
| 0:53:20| So page 2 and page 3 of this handout is just another presentation that summarizes all of the design options| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3200)|
| 0:53:38| that we just went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| So rather than trying to explain it to you by just looking at this one page,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| which is relatively packed with information and perhaps not as easy to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3225)|
| 0:53:50| that's why I broke it out into the PowerPoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| There's not anything new on these two pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| It's just presented in a different format.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3236)|
| 0:54:00| So unless anybody has objection, I'm just going to pass over these pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3240)|
| 0:54:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3256)|
| 0:54:17| Page 4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3257)|
| 0:54:20| Here we look at all of the different scenarios| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3260)|
| 0:54:25| and see what the implication is to the contribution under adopting the various different design options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3265)|
| 0:54:34| And as you can see, over the next ten years, the difference is almost nil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3274)|
| 0:54:41| And that's because it's not applying to all the current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3281)|
| 0:54:45| It's applying to new people, which are going to have the smallest benefits over the next ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3285)|
| 0:54:50| It's going to be 15, 20, 30 years before those new people comprise the majority of the liability| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3290)|
| 0:54:56| and until the current unfunded liability is projected to be paid off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3296)|
| 0:55:03| So, you know, what this does not show is the separation of risk between the city and between the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3303)|
| 0:55:15| In other words, if you looked at this and you looked at the D.C. only option,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| which happens to be the black line or it's the dark brown line with the circle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3320)|
| 0:55:25| it's the second highest of the lines out on the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3325)|
| 0:55:28| And you say, well, from the city's perspective, that's not helping us as much as some of the other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3328)|
| 0:55:33| In that option, however, the city is taking all the investment risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3333)|
| 0:55:37| So by the time you get there, I can say with confidence, the city's contribution is going to be 6% employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3337)|
| 0:55:45| 8% for the general government, and 10% for the fire and police because that's the way it's designed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3345)|
| 0:55:51| and there's not any investment risk on the city under that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3351)|
| 0:55:54| I'm not suggesting that's the best option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3354)|
| 0:55:56| I'm just trying to explain that under that option, all the risk is getting moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| Under the hybrid options, there's going to be a lot less variability in the contribution as the risk is being shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3361)|
| 0:56:09| So it's not going to be as volatile as the current all DB option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3369)|
| 0:56:15| So as you look at these and you try to see what the difference are in the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3375)|
| 0:56:20| don't just focus on the cost difference, but also consider how much risk is being shared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3380)|
| 0:56:27| And if you believe that's a desirable option, take that into account as you're considering these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3387)|
| 0:56:33| not just the absolute dollar amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| Now, the next slide, page 5, shows the same type projection with a 6.5% assumption instead of 7 and 3 8s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3396)|
| 0:56:51| Now, some people think 7 and 3 8s is too high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| Some people think 7 and 3 8s is too low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3415)|
| 0:56:58| My experience has been, regardless of what you think the assumption should be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3418)|
| 0:57:07| currently the pension plan is comprised of about 65% inactive liability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3427)|
| 0:57:15| which are people that no longer work at the city, retirees, Board of Education, Plan F, deferred vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3435)|
| 0:57:24| That's a lot of people that are getting monthly payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3444)|
| 0:57:28| That's where that $40 million a year is coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3448)|
| 0:57:31| So, arguably, the more people you have in pay status, the more consistent you'd like your income to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3451)|
| 0:57:40| the more conservative you might want to be on the investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| Now, I've had many discussions with Mr. Cherry, with the pension board, of the implications of where we are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| of where we might want to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3470)|
| 0:57:53| One of the possible options is to invest relatively more conservatively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3473)|
| 0:57:58| and I don't think anybody is suggesting we go in and change the investment policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| and switch up all the investments tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3482)|
| 0:58:04| But if the investment policy was gradually changed over the next 10, 15, 20, 30 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3484)|
| 0:58:10| 6.5% might be the expected rate of return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3490)|
| 0:58:14| which would be expected, though a lower rate of return, to create less volatility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3494)|
| 0:58:21| which means less variation in contribution for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3501)|
| 0:58:25| and also less risk for the employee to the extent the employee has any risk in a hybrid plan option, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3505)|
| 0:58:34| So, you know, you can look at this slide and say, I don't like this slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| I like the other slide better because the other slide has lower numbers on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3518)|
| 0:58:43| But what you can't directly see is the other slide with the higher 7 and 3 8's also assumes more equity exposure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3523)|
| 0:58:52| more risk, potentially greater returns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| Which one is the right answer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3537)|
| 0:58:59| You know, that's somebody's decision, not mine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3539)|
| 0:59:02| but I've certainly been talking to the pension board about it, to the investment manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3542)|
| 0:59:07| and it's something that's going to be an ongoing discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3547)|
| 0:59:09| It's not directly part of this redesign discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3549)|
| 0:59:14| However, I had to make some assumption for the projections, some assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3554)|
| 0:59:21| If you say, what is this going to cost if we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3561)|
| 0:59:24| What is this going to cost if we do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3564)|
| 0:59:27| Well, I've assumed a base return for this and for the other slides that you're going to see of 6.5%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3567)|
| 0:59:34| which I think is a reasonable assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3574)|
| 0:59:37| Now, if you guys go back and say, gee, I want to see this at different rates of return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3577)|
| 0:59:42| I want to see this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3582)|
| 0:59:43| I want to see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3583)|
| 0:59:44| I mean, those are all going to be parts of discussion, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3584)|
| 0:59:46| and back and forth over the next several weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3586)|
| 0:59:48| which I'll be pleased to provide whatever information you'd like to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3588)|
| 0:59:51| But that's at least some of the thinking behind why I presented the information the way I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3591)|
| 0:59:56| You told Mr. Wallace it was 5.3% over the last ten years on average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3596)|
| 1:00:00| That was the actual historical return for ten years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3600)|
| 1:00:04| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3604)|
| 1:00:05| Which would be a higher line than all of these we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| 5.3% would be a higher contribution rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3608)|
| 1:00:14| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3614)|
| 1:00:15| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3615)|
| 1:00:16| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3616)|
| 1:00:17| If we assume 5.3%, that's a lower return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3617)|
| 1:00:19| That means higher contributions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3619)|
| 1:00:20| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3620)|
| 1:00:22| Councilman Wallace, is that an old line or do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3622)|
| 1:00:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3625)|
| 1:00:26| I anticipated his follow-up question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3626)|
| 1:00:33| May I proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3633)|
| 1:00:34| Please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3634)|
| 1:00:39| Well, the 6% employee contribution, if I understand what you're saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3639)|
| 1:00:46| I'm not quite sure I understand what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3646)|
| 1:00:49| To get their return and to get their payout, it's going to require more contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3649)|
| 1:00:54| That's what we're saying because the rate of return is going to be less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3654)|
| 1:00:59| And to get their payout per month, it's going to require more of their dollars in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| Not more of the employee dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3664)|
| 1:01:06| More of the city dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3666)|
| 1:01:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3667)|
| 1:01:08| To hit their.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3668)|
| 1:01:09| Nobody has suggested under any of these scenarios that the employees would be contributing anything except 6% of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3669)|
| 1:01:16| I'm not saying somebody might not suggest that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3676)|
| 1:01:18| But under these scenarios, it's 6% fixed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| Is that 6% fixed too, Mr. Lyons?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| I mean, that's a number back to your Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3684)|
| 1:01:28| That's off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3688)|
| 1:01:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3689)|
| 1:01:30| I think that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3690)|
| 1:01:31| I think Blackwell covers for the employees that rate of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3691)|
| 1:01:33| For current employees, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3693)|
| 1:01:35| But this is only applying to future here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3695)|
| 1:01:37| So these could be, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3697)|
| 1:01:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3699)|
| 1:01:40| If you guys looked at this and said, hey, we want to, you know, 8% for employees and let's see those projections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3700)|
| 1:01:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3705)|
| 1:01:46| We can run that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| Again, over the next 10 or 15 years, the majority of this line that's being spiked doesn't have to do with new employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3709)|
| 1:01:58| It has to do with the unfunded liability that we already have that's largely due to what happened in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3718)|
| 1:02:04| And so that's kind of we're dealing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| We're not trying to look 10 years out and say how do we dramatically reduce that line because that's just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3726)|
| 1:02:14| Without reducing benefits for current employees, you can't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| And because of Blackwell, that, you know, unless somebody is willing to challenge that, we don't have much options there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3737)|
| 1:02:25| But what we can do is try to make some changes to reduce the risk, to share the risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3745)|
| 1:02:31| to try to ensure that we don't have a repeat of what happened in 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3751)|
| 1:02:35| What makes you think that we're going to put $40 million a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| Got a line here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3759)|
| 1:02:40| Councilman Graves recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3760)|
| 1:02:42| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3762)|
| 1:02:44| With what you just said, do I understand that if we did not hire another employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3764)|
| 1:02:49| that this line that I'm looking at is going to continue to go up for 20 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3769)|
| 1:02:56| We'll have a liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| This line represents new employees and current employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3777)|
| 1:03:01| If we didn't hire any more employees, you've still got a significant $130 million or whatever it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3781)|
| 1:03:09| unfunded liability that is going to have to be funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3789)|
| 1:03:13| So even if you didn't let any more people into the system, you've still got a significant unfunded liability to pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3793)|
| 1:03:19| That runs about how much a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3799)|
| 1:03:22| It goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3802)|
| 1:03:23| It goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3803)|
| 1:03:24| I mean, you know, if you did a flat amortization over 30 years, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3804)|
| 1:03:27| maybe it's depending on what the interest rate is, $25 million a year, $27 million a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3807)|
| 1:03:33| You know, you use these smoothing options and other things, it starts out lower and it gets higher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3813)|
| 1:03:37| So that just kind of depends on all the various assumptions that we use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3817)|
| 1:03:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3823)|
| 1:03:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| This page shows for new employees under the various scenarios that we've put forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3836)|
| 1:04:07| I started to say proposed, and let me emphasize I'm not proposing anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| All I'm doing is saying here are some design options for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3852)|
| 1:04:18| For new employees, if we said what is the expected cost per year if we didn't have any unfunded liability?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3858)|
| 1:04:31| So if we get out 30 years from now and we meet all our assumptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3871)|
| 1:04:35| what would we be expecting to put into the plan each year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| For the general government, you can see I included the first column| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3878)|
| 1:04:44| because that is the assumptions that we used in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3884)|
| 1:04:49| Those are the assumptions before the experience study, which the experience study assumptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3889)|
| 1:04:56| the big change is the 7 3 8 discount rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3896)|
| 1:04:59| We also made some other changes to turnover, mortality, a few other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| But the discount rate was the big change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3903)|
| 1:05:05| If we were using the 2011 assumptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3905)|
| 1:05:12| we'd be looking at long-term city contributions of about 6% of pay for the general government plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3912)|
| 1:05:20| Under the experience study assumptions with the 7 3 8s, with the new mortality and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3920)|
| 1:05:27| it's about 7.7, 7.69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3927)|
| 1:05:33| Now, as I said, looking at the various alternatives and the projections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3933)|
| 1:05:37| I've considered 6.5% as a baseline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3937)|
| 1:05:40| So if we change the current plan assumptions, not the provisions, just the assumptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3940)|
| 1:05:47| we're looking at about 10% of pay, ongoing cost, current plan with all the risk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| remaining with the employee, I mean, I'm sorry, with the city under the current plan provisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| So the 10% number under the city contributions is kind of the starting comparison point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3959)|
| 1:06:09| which is really the third column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3969)|
| 1:06:12| As you look to the right, you see these other numbers, 6% to 7%, the last number being 8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3972)|
| 1:06:20| Since I initially did this chart, scenario five, I was estimating it initially saying, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3980)|
| 1:06:28| if it's a D.C. account and you always get at least what the D.C. account is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3988)|
| 1:06:32| then the contribution should be about the same, 8% of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| That actually is not the case because if somebody terminates as a non-vest or as a vested employee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=3996)|
| 1:06:43| and takes a refund, just like the current plan design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4003)|
| 1:06:46| they would get a refund of employee contributions under the D.B.D.C.max.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4006)|
| 1:06:51| So that total cost ends up being closer to 7% of pay, not 8% of pay under scenario five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4011)|
| 1:07:04| What was at the bottom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4024)|
| 1:07:05| What was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| When does that adjust to down at the bottom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4026)|
| 1:07:08| Total expected cost changes that 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4028)|
| 1:07:11| What does that do to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4031)|
| 1:07:12| 13%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4032)|
| 1:07:16| The number at the bottom is really the total city contribution plus the total two lines of the employee contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4036)|
| 1:07:26| So, yeah, that would go down to 13% from 14.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4046)|
| 1:07:30| Similarly, on page seven, for the fire and police, 22% of pay would be the current plan provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4050)|
| 1:07:39| using a 6.5% assumption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| The other alternative plan design options range from just over 7% of pay up to 13.7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4062)|
| 1:07:53| almost 14% of pay in the modified current.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4073)|
| 1:07:57| Now, again, I think there's going to be a lot of back and forth with the various plan provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4077)|
| 1:08:03| so I would encourage you not to look at these particular numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4083)|
| 1:08:07| and start making any judgments about which plan design you think may be the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4087)|
| 1:08:12| Any of these plan designs can be either made relatively more expensive or relatively less expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4092)|
| 1:08:19| depending on how the plan provisions are tweaked, the retirement age, the retirement factor, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4099)|
| 1:08:24| the COLA, et cetera, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4104)|
| 1:08:27| So I think it's more important at this stage to figure out which design option you feel like is most viable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4107)|
| 1:08:36| and then we can start looking at those provisions and saying, well, if you do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| what's the cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| If you do this, what's the projected benefit to the employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| This is merely to give you a starting kind of comparison just to give you a little flavor for what's going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4125)|
| 1:08:56| The last, excuse me, I'm not going to take time to go through the last two pages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4136)|
| 1:09:01| They're showing up sideways on my screen anyway, which isn't particularly helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4141)|
| 1:09:07| The last two pages just run through a couple scenarios for a 30-year employee based on the provisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4147)|
| 1:09:14| that I've suggested to start with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| Since my expectation is we're going to have some back and forth on the various provisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| these numbers on this slide may end up being not as meaningful or helpful until we get closer to the point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4162)|
| 1:09:29| where people are actually getting some provisions firmed up and saying, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4169)|
| 1:09:33| this is what we really think we want to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4173)|
| 1:09:35| and therefore now show us what's going to happen to a 20-year employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4175)|
| 1:09:39| a 30-year employee that retires at this age or this age or et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4179)|
| 1:09:45| That concludes really my prepared comments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| but, of course, I'm pleased to try to answer any further questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4187)|
| 1:09:51| or any questions that we can't answer in this context to go back to the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4191)|
| 1:09:57| and put Megan to work so she can answer them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4197)|
| 1:10:00| Councilman Grave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| I do have a question on, I guess, each one of the plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4202)|
| 1:10:06| What does it cost the city to run the existing plan, you know, as of today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| I mean, what are the total costs that we're having to pay for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4211)|
| 1:10:15| And then how does that relate to each one of these different situations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4215)|
| 1:10:19| Is it the same or is it going to cost us more or less?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4219)|
| 1:10:21| What is it that we have to pay to run these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4221)|
| 1:10:23| The current cost of the plan can be thought of as two different components.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4223)|
| 1:10:29| One is the cost of benefits being accrued by current employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| which is, let's call it about 11% of pay for all employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| That's the fire and police and general government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| So that would be $6.5 million, $7 million, let's call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4242)|
| 1:10:49| Any contribution, the $13 million that's projected in the upcoming fiscal year budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4249)|
| 1:10:57| if $7 million, which is approximately the cost of benefits being earned, the remainder of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4257)|
| 1:11:02| $6 million is going toward that $130 million deficit, the unfunded liability that's sitting out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4262)|
| 1:11:10| So 11% of pay is if you do all of the factors being equal, that's kind of the ongoing expected cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4270)|
| 1:11:17| Without, you know, in addition to this unfunded liability, it's going to have to be paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4277)|
| 1:11:22| What I'm talking about is the administrative cost in terms of what does it cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4282)|
| 1:11:26| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4286)|
| 1:11:27| Not the benefit component, but the administrative cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4289)|
| 1:11:30| And is it different for each one of the plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4290)|
| 1:11:33| Mike, do you want to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4293)|
| 1:11:37| And how is that determined?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4297)|
| 1:11:40| Would you mind to come down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4300)|
| 1:11:44| I know we're not going to be able to hear you from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4304)|
| 1:11:55| If you'll just identify yourself for the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4315)|
| 1:11:59| Mike Cherry, the Executive Director of the Pension System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| The expenses, certainly when we're looking at the expenses of the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4322)|
| 1:12:05| we divide into three little sections real quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4325)|
| 1:12:07| They're just literally the administrative expenses for running the office, doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4327)|
| 1:12:12| And that has in the past been around $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4332)|
| 1:12:15| We did add an employee this year, so that will be closer to $300,000 in round numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4335)|
| 1:12:21| And then we have our professional expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4341)|
| 1:12:24| That's what we pay our attorneys, actuaries, auditors, those expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4344)|
| 1:12:30| And they're running, not on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4350)|
| 1:12:33| but I want to say they've been a little higher than what they have normally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4353)|
| 1:12:37| but around a couple of hundred thousand dollars a year in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4357)|
| 1:12:41| And then thirdly, and the largest section of those expenses, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4361)|
| 1:12:45| are the fees that we pay our investment managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4365)|
| 1:12:50| And those fees are essentially set by the contracts that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4370)|
| 1:12:55| And they're running at around $3 million currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4375)|
| 1:12:59| So those are the expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4379)|
| 1:13:02| In total, that would be $3.5 million or so, $3.6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4382)|
| 1:13:07| As far as the percentage of the total, what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4387)|
| 1:13:12| That would be what about, I'm going to say, 75 basis points or three-quarters of a percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4392)|
| 1:13:20| And how does that compare to other plans?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4400)|
| 1:13:22| Are we high?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4402)|
| 1:13:23| Are we low?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4403)|
| 1:13:24| Are we medium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4404)|
| 1:13:25| Let me, Alan, do you have any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4405)|
| 1:13:27| Yeah, for this size plan, you know, 60 to 70 basis points,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4407)|
| 1:13:30| which I think is about where they are, is not out of line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4410)|
| 1:13:34| I mean, that seems to be, you know, not uncommon range to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4414)|
| 1:13:39| Are administrative costs, are they looked at every year in terms of what we are spending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4419)|
| 1:13:45| Is this something that's reviewed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4425)|
| 1:13:46| And who reviews it, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4426)|
| 1:13:48| I guess that's my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4428)|
| 1:13:49| Well, we do look at that, and certainly we give reports annually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4429)|
| 1:13:53| and we have what I refer to as a budget or a financial plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| which we're putting together for the next fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4436)|
| 1:14:00| Again, the biggest portion of that has to do with those investment expenditures to our managers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4440)|
| 1:14:05| which, again, is not something that we control.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4445)|
| 1:14:08| Typically, in the contract, the basis for determining those costs is in the contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4448)|
| 1:14:16| in terms of the market value that they manage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4456)|
| 1:14:20| So what you're saying is we're spending three and a half plus million a year to administer the plan, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4460)|
| 1:14:27| And would that be the same for each one of these plans that you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4467)|
| 1:14:32| I mean, the hybrids and the, would it be the same amount of money for each plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4472)|
| 1:14:37| I'm trying to think if we had both the current plan and an additional plan, Alan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| The investment expenses comprise the largest portion of the cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4482)|
| 1:14:46| and I expect those would be similar under any one of the hybrid options of the modified DB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4486)|
| 1:14:53| The expenses might be a bit different under the defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4493)|
| 1:14:58| Sometimes those are paid by the sponsor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| Sometimes they're paid for by the employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| So that discussion would have to be had at some future time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4505)|
| 1:15:09| That was considered to be a viable alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4514)|
| 1:15:15| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4515)|
| 1:15:21| As I understand it, almost half or 47 percent of the employees are over the age of 45,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4521)|
| 1:15:28| and so marching towards that retirement goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4528)|
| 1:15:31| Does that affect the charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| That's all taken into account in your calculations of what an actuary does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4533)|
| 1:15:37| You look at the work career and the lifespan and the whatever, the age of the persons involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4537)|
| 1:15:43| Yes, sir, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4543)|
| 1:15:46| So that those numbers don't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4546)|
| 1:15:48| What affects the cost chart or the cost shortfall chart that you've projected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4548)|
| 1:15:55| whether it's at 8 percent, seven and a quarter, three-eighths, or six and a half,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4555)|
| 1:16:01| is really the difference in investment performance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4561)|
| 1:16:05| and where we are now in terms of market value of assets versus benefits owed, so to speak, or accrued to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4565)|
| 1:16:13| Is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4573)|
| 1:16:14| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4574)|
| 1:16:15| And that number is not really changeable, I take it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4575)|
| 1:16:18| I mean, in other words, that's the best guess as an actuary of what the costs paid out are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4578)|
| 1:16:24| and you're applying that to where the assets are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4584)|
| 1:16:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4587)|
| 1:16:28| The extent that I'm determining the liabilities, the turnover, retirement, mortality, salary scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4588)|
| 1:16:37| all those things are relatively predictable and don't produce large gain losses on the whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4597)|
| 1:16:45| It's the discount rate that is highly variable and produces the biggest gain losses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4605)|
| 1:16:51| and so that's kind of, again, kind of what's led us to where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4611)|
| 1:16:55| And if your chart shows that we have to put in $45 million in a particular year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4615)|
| 1:17:00| and the city doesn't have that money, what happens to your chart?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| It just shifts upward in terms of the shortfall is now greater,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4622)|
| 1:17:06| so the amount needed in the next 22 or 24 years to 2036, that's not the kind of the year where it starts to drop off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4626)|
| 1:17:15| Right, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4635)|
| 1:17:16| To the extent you get to a year and the recommended contribution is not deposited,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4636)|
| 1:17:22| obviously that shortfall just gets deferred to future years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4642)|
| 1:17:26| So the chart goes upward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4646)|
| 1:17:28| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| And I think there's an additional issue with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| If I understand the charter correctly, the way it's written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| it doesn't really allow much compromise between, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4660)|
| 1:17:45| if this is what the recommended contribution is and the pension board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4665)|
| 1:17:48| or the administration comes back to me and says, well, we can't contribute this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4668)|
| 1:17:53| You know, we can have some discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4673)|
| 1:17:55| You can tweak some assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4675)|
| 1:17:57| But as I understand the way things are currently written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| the city doesn't really have a whole lot of flexibility in terms of whether| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| or not they're going to contribute the recommended contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4682)|
| 1:18:06| And if the city puts on a charter amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4686)|
| 1:18:12| a change in the plan that either requires greater employee contributions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4692)|
| 1:18:17| less COLA, higher retirement ages,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4697)|
| 1:18:21| something that changes this balance of cost to the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| and the voters say that's what they want, isn't that the plan you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4705)|
| 1:18:29| Regardless of what the Supreme Court said in an unrelated case in 1985,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4709)|
| 1:18:34| that if the voters change the charter of this city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| isn't that the plan you have to administer as an actuary?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| I mean, to the extent the voters make a change| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4722)|
| 1:18:46| and the administration asks me to tell them what the cost is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4726)|
| 1:18:50| of course I will calculate those numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| To the extent groups decide to contest that, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| That's out of your hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4737)|
| 1:18:58| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4738)|
| 1:18:59| That's out of my hands, exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4739)|
| 1:19:00| Now, if the city comes to me and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4740)|
| 1:19:02| I have had groups that have said not the city of Knoxville, let me clarify,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4742)|
| 1:19:06| but I have had other groups that have said, can you use these assumptions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4746)|
| 1:19:09| These are the assumptions we want you to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4749)|
| 1:19:11| And I say, I don't think those are reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4751)|
| 1:19:13| And they say, well, that's fine, we respect that, but use them anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4753)|
| 1:19:17| Then I present the numbers they want and right beside it I put the numbers that I say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4757)|
| 1:19:22| well, if you use my recommendation of assumptions, this is what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4762)|
| 1:19:26| That would just mask the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4766)|
| 1:19:27| Exactly, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4767)|
| 1:19:28| False assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4768)|
| 1:19:29| Yes, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4769)|
| 1:19:33| And the problem we experienced in 2008 is once you reduce the base amount in the account,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4773)|
| 1:19:40| then a percentage growth is on a smaller base.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| So that's why you're that much further behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4785)|
| 1:19:46| If you lost 26% in 2008 or some number like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| you might have to gain 58% or something to get back to even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4790)|
| 1:19:54| Some larger number, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4794)|
| 1:19:55| Some larger number to get back to just parity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4797)|
| 1:19:58| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4798)|
| 1:19:59| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4799)|
| 1:20:00| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| I'd like to get a response to that question about the Blackwell decision from either Attorney Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4802)|
| 1:20:11| or Attorney Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4811)|
| 1:20:13| That seems like a legal question that we may have to consider,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| but I'd like to get one of them to answer that question that Councilman DellaVolpe just proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4817)|
| 1:20:25| Of course, I might add to that that I've asked that we get a pension attorney to address us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| because every case is decided on its facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4830)|
| 1:20:33| and courts sometimes say things broadly that are different than what they've held on the specific facts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4833)|
| 1:20:40| and they might eat them in a later date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4840)|
| 1:20:42| In other words, you can't project all future activity from one case and some broad generalizations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4842)|
| 1:20:48| But I'd love to hear from Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4848)|
| 1:20:50| And we'll have that discussion this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| Right, right, this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| And what Mr. DellaVolpe says is exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4856)|
| 1:20:59| That's the way cases are decided on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4859)|
| 1:21:02| But all we can do to predict what the court is going to do in the future is what it's done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4862)|
| 1:21:09| And the Blackwell decision is a decision that was decided in 1981 by the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4869)|
| 1:21:15| I think it's interesting to note that despite the fact that there has been a great deal of pressure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4875)|
| 1:21:20| to make changes in that decision, to distinguish that decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4880)|
| 1:21:25| to do something other than what that decision says, it's never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4885)|
| 1:21:30| There is one case out there that was in 2010 where it was challenged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4890)|
| 1:21:36| and the court was able to distinguish it because what happened was you had a new pension plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4896)|
| 1:21:42| as opposed to you had people who opted in to a new pension plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4902)|
| 1:21:46| and what they wanted to do was to get the best out of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4906)|
| 1:21:49| And the court said you can't have the best out of both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4909)|
| 1:21:52| If you choose to go into the new pension plan, you're going to be subject to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| But that really wasn't a change in the Blackwell decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4916)|
| 1:21:59| With the Blackwell decision, it was a fairly narrow decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| What happened in Memphis-Shelby County was they had a pension plan that had been in effect since the 1930s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4923)|
| 1:22:10| They had changed it 40-some times since that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4930)|
| 1:22:15| But the change that they took under consideration at the time the Blackwell case came before the Supreme Court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| was a fairly small change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| What happened was they had been averaging it at five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| The salary that was computed, they averaged at five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4949)|
| 1:22:33| Then they changed that to it was based on the last 12 months, just one year's worth of experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4953)|
| 1:22:41| They changed it to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| That's obviously more favorable to the employee because it doesn't get averaged down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4962)|
| 1:22:46| It's the most you ever made is the general rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4966)|
| 1:22:49| So they had it at 12 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| Then they changed it back just from that 12 months to three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4971)|
| 1:22:56| When they changed it back to three years, that means somebody who retires is going to be getting less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4976)|
| 1:23:03| And that's when they sued.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4983)|
| 1:23:04| And when they sued, that was the only thing that they addressed really in this Blackwell case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4984)|
| 1:23:09| And they said for people who are vested, you can't reduce their benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4989)|
| 1:23:15| Even this small amount, you can't reduce it by averaging by three years rather than by one year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=4995)|
| 1:23:22| And they very clearly said they didn't use the word vested, but what they meant was vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5002)|
| 1:23:28| And you can read the opinion yourself and see that the term that they mean is vested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5008)|
| 1:23:33| For vested employees, you cannot diminish their retirement benefits in any way, shape, or form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5013)|
| 1:23:41| And they said that fairly clearly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5021)|
| 1:23:43| Chief Justice Harbison did in his opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5023)|
| 1:23:45| Now, it's suggested that for those who are not vested but are in the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5025)|
| 1:23:52| that you can make changes if it is necessary to maintain actuarial stability, the issue that you raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5032)|
| 1:23:59| But they didn't say that with regard to vested employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5039)|
| 1:24:02| They didn't care whether you were maintaining actuarial stability or not, at least in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5042)|
| 1:24:08| Now, could you come with a different case and get them to change their mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| Maybe you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5051)|
| 1:24:12| Maybe you can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5052)|
| 1:24:13| We don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5053)|
| 1:24:14| And that's part of the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| When you're trying to design what you're going to do for the future, if you design a lawsuit, you've done a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5055)|
| 1:24:24| Number one, you've delayed the decision for multiple years, as you well know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5064)|
| 1:24:30| It's going to take a number of years to get that case before the Supreme Court and get a decision from the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5070)|
| 1:24:38| All the while, you may be incurring significant liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5078)|
| 1:24:42| All the while, you darn well will be incurring attorneys' fees and expenses associated with that litigation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5082)|
| 1:24:49| When you get to the back end of that whole situation, you may prevail and you may not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5089)|
| 1:24:55| If you don't, not only do you have the delay, not only do you have the expense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5095)|
| 1:25:00| you also have the liability associated with your failure to win.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5100)|
| 1:25:04| So it's pretty important that you predict what the right outcome of the case is going to be if you choose to go the litigation route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5104)|
| 1:25:12| And my suggestion is that you might want to be conservative in how you predict that rather than hopeful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5112)|
| 1:25:20| I'm going to recognize Attorney Frost here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| I guess this is a continuation, I would assume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5123)|
| 1:25:26| Yes, briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5126)|
| 1:25:28| To answer Councilman Brown's question, I have not spoken with Mr. Swanson before this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5128)|
| 1:25:34| Approximately, I'm guessing, six or seven years ago before I held this position, I had a very similar conversation to at least,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5134)|
| 1:25:43| I guess that was with one or two, potentially three law directors ago when some retirees were looking for some changes to their pension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5143)|
| 1:25:54| and had this discussion with the law director at this time, and I apologize,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5154)|
| 1:25:58| I don't remember if it was Morris Kaiser or Debbie Poplin or Michael Kelly, and they referred me to the Blackwell decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5158)|
| 1:26:07| And the city attorney at that time had the opinion that you could not alter the benefits of those vested employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5167)|
| 1:26:20| And I read the case well as well and independently came to my own conclusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5180)|
| 1:26:26| Now, that doesn't mean that I'm not happy to, you know, dig that back out, see if there's a different interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5186)|
| 1:26:33| But I just, you know, to follow up on your question and Mr. Swanson's remark that I looked at this a number of years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5193)|
| 1:26:42| when times were better and the pension was a lot more in better condition than it presently is due to, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5202)|
| 1:26:49| market conditions that the city could not impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5209)|
| 1:26:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5213)|
| 1:26:54| That answers my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5214)|
| 1:26:55| I have one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5216)|
| 1:26:57| On page six, we have under the modified no rule of 80 and no drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5217)|
| 1:27:03| Now, for the general public and those people who are not so involved in city benefits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5223)|
| 1:27:11| could somebody kind of talk about this rule of 80 and no drop and a drop rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5231)|
| 1:27:18| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5238)|
| 1:27:20| The rule of 80 was put in for the general government in about 2001, 2001,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5240)|
| 1:27:28| that said instead of having to wait until age 62 to retire, if you accumulated 80 points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5248)|
| 1:27:36| and you get one point for each year of age and one point for each year of service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| that you could retire with a full unreduced pension with no early retirement reduction factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5262)|
| 1:27:48| So if you were 55 years old and had 25 years of service, your age plus your service is 80,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5268)|
| 1:27:56| therefore you could retire at 55,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| and the early retirement reduction that normally applies would not then apply to your benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5279)|
| 1:28:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| And if we have just in the future for new hires, and we don't have that, in terms of if you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5287)|
| 1:28:16| in terms of savings in the future, what kind of savings are you talking about without that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5296)|
| 1:28:24| I mean, if you're talking about a plan, let's say, that costs 8% of pay and has no rule of 80,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5304)|
| 1:28:35| and then you say, well, let's put the rule of 80 in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| What's that going to cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5317)|
| 1:28:39| Maybe it's 9% of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5319)|
| 1:28:40| I mean, it's not 15%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| It's not going to double the cost, but it's going to increase the cost maybe 10%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5322)|
| 1:28:47| or something over what you had before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5327)|
| 1:28:51| You know, I'm not sure there's any one benefit you can look at and say, well, gee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| that's the one that we shouldn't have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5336)|
| 1:28:58| but I think there's a combination of a lot of things that have combined together to create some higher expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5338)|
| 1:29:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5346)|
| 1:29:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5347)|
| 1:29:08| Mr. Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5348)|
| 1:29:13| I guess I'll go back to a couple of references you've made to the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5353)|
| 1:29:17| and how limiting and in what ways are you limited by the wording in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5357)|
| 1:29:23| that the pension is in the charter and how are you restricted by that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5363)|
| 1:29:28| and would it be a benefit to take it out of the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5368)|
| 1:29:31| and would that give you in such more latitude to, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5371)|
| 1:29:35| it seems very late in response to a 2008 drop to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5375)|
| 1:29:40| If you didn't have a limitation to the charter, would that be a benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5380)|
| 1:29:44| Talk to me a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5384)|
| 1:29:45| The limitation that I was referring to in the charter largely has to do to ensure that the city contributes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5385)|
| 1:29:52| the recommended contribution regardless of any other factors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| So there have been some states, Illinois, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5396)|
| 1:30:00| who felt that they couldn't make the recommended contribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5400)|
| 1:30:03| even though their funding situation is much, much worse than Knoxville's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5403)|
| 1:30:07| And they've had years where they simply just didn't make a contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5407)|
| 1:30:10| The charter language is written such that the city simply just doesn't have that alternative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5410)|
| 1:30:16| So that does not limit me, but it certainly does, you know, if you want to say encumbrance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5416)|
| 1:30:22| I mean it certainly puts a limitation on the administration, the budget committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5422)|
| 1:30:26| as they're trying to decide, you know, how are we going to handle this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5426)|
| 1:30:31| Speak to that, Bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5431)|
| 1:30:32| Can you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5432)|
| 1:30:33| I mean how does the charter put limitations on you and the administration and on the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5433)|
| 1:30:38| Well, if the same requirements could have been by ordinance as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5438)|
| 1:30:43| anything in here could be most cities, the vast majority, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| have pension described in ordinance and not in the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| which means it can be a much more rapid reaction by council to make alterations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5450)|
| 1:30:57| and they would not be taken to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5457)|
| 1:31:00| But in terms of what the actual specified elements are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5460)|
| 1:31:04| it doesn't matter whether they're in the charter or in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5464)|
| 1:31:06| I mean they're there either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5466)|
| 1:31:08| They can just be changed a lot more efficiently if they're not in the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5468)|
| 1:31:11| and they're in the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| So if we weren't limited by the charter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5472)|
| 1:31:15| then we could have made some changes a little bit quicker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5475)|
| 1:31:18| and responded to this loss a little bit more effectively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5478)|
| 1:31:21| I mean, is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5481)|
| 1:31:22| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5482)|
| 1:31:23| You're still bound by Blackwell, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5483)|
| 1:31:25| Bound by Blackwell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5485)|
| 1:31:26| But still the council could make changes much more quickly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| and not be limited to now for charter change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| You have to be in the statewide election cycle, so you have to wait two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| It's like right here, you have to wait two years if it's not addressed in June.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5496)|
| 1:31:39| If it's in ordinance, you change it when you change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5499)|
| 1:31:43| And that's something that I want to talk about that we should| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5503)|
| 1:31:46| and I think that ought to be part of our discussions over our next meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| is an option of looking at taking the pension out of the charter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5509)|
| 1:31:53| because it seems very impractical to deal with these problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| We're on this deadline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5516)|
| 1:31:57| We're all forced to make, you know, and then we're still subject to the voters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| And we still can't make decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5522)|
| 1:32:04| And I think that we should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5524)|
| 1:32:05| I think that ought to be some serious consideration as we move these discussions forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5525)|
| 1:32:10| as they've indicated tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5530)|
| 1:32:13| Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5533)|
| 1:32:16| Let me just make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5536)|
| 1:32:17| Yeah, let me go to Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| I just want to make a brief, very brief response to Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| You know, in our charter, the pension takes up two-thirds of the charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5544)|
| 1:32:28| But, in fact, Article II, Section 225, does exactly what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5548)|
| 1:32:33| It allows the city to set up a pension system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5553)|
| 1:32:36| And that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5556)|
| 1:32:37| That's really all you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5557)|
| 1:32:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5558)|
| 1:32:39| But to get it out of the charter, you have to go this same route.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5559)|
| 1:32:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5563)|
| 1:32:44| But that could be the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5564)|
| 1:32:45| That is an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| They've thrown out their options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5567)|
| 1:32:48| I'm throwing out a option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5568)|
| 1:32:49| That would be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5569)|
| 1:32:50| Take it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5570)|
| 1:32:51| And then we could move through this process a little more efficiently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5571)|
| 1:32:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5575)|
| 1:32:57| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5577)|
| 1:32:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5579)|
| 1:33:00| Maybe I didn't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5580)|
| 1:33:01| When Mayor Brown asked about the drop program and the Rule of Eighty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5581)|
| 1:33:06| I heard the definition for Rule of Eighty, but I must have missed the drop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| No, ma'am, you didn't miss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5591)|
| 1:33:13| I finished the Rule of Eighty, and then there wasn't a follow-up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5593)|
| 1:33:17| It moved on, and so I didn't stop everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| But I'll be happy to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5599)|
| 1:33:21| The drop is a deferred retirement option plan or option program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5601)|
| 1:33:26| which would allow a member, either in the general government or fire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5606)|
| 1:33:30| and police, up to two years before they are ready to retire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5610)|
| 1:33:36| Let's say somebody was 60 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5616)|
| 1:33:39| and he was eligible for Rule of Eighty in the general government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5619)|
| 1:33:42| and he said, well, you know, I think I'm getting a good pension right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| Let me lock my pension benefit in at $30,000 a year, but I want to work two more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5626)|
| 1:33:53| So he comes in and comes into the pension office and signs his paperwork,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5633)|
| 1:33:59| and then his pension benefits $30,000 a year, and that's what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5639)|
| 1:34:03| But he works for two more years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5643)|
| 1:34:05| He doesn't get any pension dollars until he leaves employment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5645)|
| 1:34:11| at which time at age 62 in this scenario, he would get $60,000 approximately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5651)|
| 1:34:17| two years' worth of pension payments, plus his ongoing $30,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| plus adjustments for any COLAs that would have happened in the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5661)|
| 1:34:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5665)|
| 1:34:26| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5666)|
| 1:34:29| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| I want to go back to Dan's question because I still haven't heard the answer that I think we all need to hear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5671)|
| 1:34:38| and it's one that we haven't obtained yet and we probably have to chase after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5678)|
| 1:34:42| And that is if you make the Blackwell decision some kind of idol and you bow before it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5682)|
| 1:34:50| then everything that happens just turns out to be predestined,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5690)|
| 1:34:56| and we're really not a body representing the taxpayers of this community and the citizens of this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5696)|
| 1:35:02| And it's clear from what Mr. Swanson said that they weren't looking at changing COLA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5702)|
| 1:35:08| or retirement contributions by an employee or any of those aspects of a retirement plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5708)|
| 1:35:15| They were looking at reducing someone's benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| And the question before us, one of the questions is, how should we share this extra cost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5717)|
| 1:35:23| Shouldn't the employees be pulling part of the laboring ore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| I mean, we're paying right now three times, I think, what the employees are paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5726)|
| 1:35:31| Aren't they about $4, $4.5 million and we're paying $13 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5731)|
| 1:35:35| Isn't that the rough ballpark?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5735)|
| 1:35:40| Roughly $4 million to $13 million for the upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5740)|
| 1:35:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5743)|
| 1:35:44| And, you know, five, six years ago that was more like they were paying 40 percent and we were paying 60 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5744)|
| 1:35:51| But now it's gotten way out of whack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| And so I think that there are other both businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5752)|
| 1:35:57| and lawyers looking at this question not only in Tennessee, which we have to deal with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5757)|
| 1:36:02| because that's where the Blackwell decision comes from, but around the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5762)|
| 1:36:05| And there are lots of cities that are faced not with just are we tweaking or adjusting a plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5765)|
| 1:36:10| but their economic survival or the sufficiency of the plan itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5770)|
| 1:36:17| which all the employees depend on for their benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5777)|
| 1:36:20| And so I don't think that we can leave out this huge chunk, the 2,300 people that are retired,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5780)|
| 1:36:25| the 1,530 people that are in the system right now working,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5785)|
| 1:36:29| and we're looking at the hundred people we're going to hire in 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5789)|
| 1:36:33| I mean, I think that we have to take a broader look,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5793)|
| 1:36:36| and I think we need some help in looking at that because there are entities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5796)|
| 1:36:40| I mean, right now TVA cut its COLA for like about two years for retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5800)|
| 1:36:44| And maybe that's a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5804)|
| 1:36:47| Maybe it isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5807)|
| 1:36:48| But people are looking at ways to make these pension plans work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5808)|
| 1:36:53| Some companies have dumped defined pension plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5813)|
| 1:36:56| and gone only to defined contribution plans, the 401K that you take with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5816)|
| 1:37:01| But, you know, okay, so the municipal government may have an interest in a defined benefit plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5821)|
| 1:37:06| because it helps, you know, hire people or retain them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5826)|
| 1:37:09| but there has to be some sensible cost limits to this thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5829)|
| 1:37:15| and we've got to find a way to deal with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5835)|
| 1:37:17| The money problem falls on this legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5837)|
| 1:37:20| and we need to look at that for the benefit of all the citizens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5840)|
| 1:37:23| and I think we need outside help if we need to look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| If you read the Blackwell case, it picked up the Pennsylvania rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| That was one line of cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5849)|
| 1:37:31| Pennsylvania seemed to be dealing with pensions a certain way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5851)|
| 1:37:34| and that's what they thought in the year 1981, I think Mr. Swanson said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| Are they still following that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| Has Pennsylvania tackled it and changed their mind?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| I mean, would we follow some adjustment to the rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5862)|
| 1:37:45| I think we need to look at that because otherwise we're playing with the tail on a very big dog,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5865)|
| 1:37:50| and we're not solving the problem, and that's what we've got to do here, so I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5870)|
| 1:37:55| Let me ask you, when you say we need to look at that, so as a layperson, explain to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5875)|
| 1:38:01| I mean, if I hear you right, you're advocating that we hire an attorney and challenge that suit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5881)|
| 1:38:06| No, no, I'm just saying that we get some advice from someone who's looked at this kind of problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5886)|
| 1:38:13| You know, we're frozen in time from 1981.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| We've got to look at what's happening both here and around the country and in Pennsylvania| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5896)|
| 1:38:20| where we adopted their rule and see if this, you know, it may not be the total totem pole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5900)|
| 1:38:26| In other words, courts do something called abitur dicta.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5906)|
| 1:38:30| That means we just said it, but when you look at that case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5910)|
| 1:38:33| the question that a later court looks at is what did they hold?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5913)|
| 1:38:37| What were the facts and what was the holding, and that's really the lesson of that case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5917)|
| 1:38:41| They said other things in getting there that they may or may not mean in a different context,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5921)|
| 1:38:46| and we need help deciding where is the limits and the rules and what can we tackle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5926)|
| 1:38:52| because if we just tackle the 100 people we're going to hire in July 2013,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5932)|
| 1:38:57| we're pushing this problem down the pike and down the taxpayers' throats.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5937)|
| 1:39:01| I don't see how that's a good service to anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| Mr. Frost, I'm glad to see you're alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5944)|
| 1:39:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5946)|
| 1:39:07| Councilman Della Vopi, I'm sure you'll correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5947)|
| 1:39:10| Maybe not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5950)|
| 1:39:12| I guess this is following up to our conversation on Thursday or Friday of last week, I don't recall which,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5952)|
| 1:39:19| concerned about the possible possibly retaining a pension professional, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5959)|
| 1:39:26| that I polled members of council about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5966)|
| 1:39:29| I mean, you know, there's some people that wanted to see what happened tonight before they voted on that poll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5969)|
| 1:39:35| Is that where you're getting to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5975)|
| 1:39:36| So we need that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5976)|
| 1:39:37| No, I was just saying I think that that's an important constraint we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| If we start with the assumption that our hands are tied, then we've got three or four options here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5980)|
| 1:39:44| five options that make a little difference, but not a ton of difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5984)|
| 1:39:48| We're trying to be fair to new hires and yet have a pension plan that works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5988)|
| 1:39:52| But those employees out there, they also want a sound pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5992)|
| 1:39:56| And if it ain't funded, somewhere the benefits are going to trail off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=5996)|
| 1:40:00| We're going to start laying off people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6000)|
| 1:40:02| We're going to raise taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6002)|
| 1:40:03| We're going to cut services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6003)|
| 1:40:05| We're going to go bankrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6005)|
| 1:40:06| You know, we're going to be like Detroit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6006)|
| 1:40:08| There's $6 billion in the hole on their pension plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6008)|
| 1:40:11| That's nuts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6011)|
| 1:40:12| I mean, that's crazy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6012)|
| 1:40:13| So we're here at a point now where we can address this, hopefully with cooperation from the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6013)|
| 1:40:18| to solve the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6018)|
| 1:40:19| Maybe they need to be looking at what they want out of this, but they ought to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6019)|
| 1:40:23| If at the end of the day you've got to pay this bill, then they've got to help us pay it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6023)|
| 1:40:28| if we're going to keep these benefits the way they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6028)|
| 1:40:30| Mr. Chairperson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6030)|
| 1:40:31| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6031)|
| 1:40:32| If I could make a one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6032)|
| 1:40:33| Hold on one second, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6033)|
| 1:40:35| Rob, you've still got your light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6035)|
| 1:40:37| Let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6037)|
| 1:40:38| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6038)|
| 1:40:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6039)|
| 1:40:40| I hear and understand your passion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6040)|
| 1:40:45| I don't pretend to speak for an administration, council, anybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6045)|
| 1:40:51| But, you know, I'm pretty certain they don't want to undergo layoffs, tax increases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6051)|
| 1:40:57| or anything like that unless absolutely positively necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6057)|
| 1:41:00| There's been no discussion of that that I'm aware of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6060)|
| 1:41:02| But what I'd like to encourage those on council, if they've not yet replied to the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6062)|
| 1:41:08| I emailed them late last week to try to do so, please, in the next 24 to 48 hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6068)|
| 1:41:13| to find out if this is something that there is a majority of council that wants to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6073)|
| 1:41:19| and what route they want to take in that regard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6079)|
| 1:41:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6083)|
| 1:41:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6084)|
| 1:41:25| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6085)|
| 1:41:26| I would add that there are, in fact, three states, Colorado, South Dakota, Minnesota,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6086)|
| 1:41:32| that have decreased the COLA for current retirees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| All of those are being challenged in court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| And I think there's several states around the country that are eagerly awaiting the outcomes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6100)|
| 1:41:44| to decide if they, too, want to pursue that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| Regardless of those outcomes, you know, they're not Tennessee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6107)|
| 1:41:51| and they don't have black people to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| You know, that may or may not give you some helpful information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6113)|
| 1:41:56| But certainly there are others out there that have that same consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6116)|
| 1:42:02| And the only other thing I guess I would add is, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| that's one possibility that I applaud the council for considering all the different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6125)|
| 1:42:11| Regardless of whether that's pursued or not, I think this other issue of do you consider a redesign option for the ballot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6131)|
| 1:42:20| and which one, it's certainly not independent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6140)|
| 1:42:24| But, you know, it's something I hope doesn't get lost in the cross between, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6144)|
| 1:42:29| all the other discussions that are going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6149)|
| 1:42:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6151)|
| 1:42:32| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6152)|
| 1:42:33| Oh, I think that, you know, to Della Vothe's point, that's just one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6153)|
| 1:42:37| You know, I think you wait and you see what else happens out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6157)|
| 1:42:41| You've got to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| That's going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6163)|
| 1:42:44| You can deal with today going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6164)|
| 1:42:46| That's one issue we've got to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6166)|
| 1:42:48| And then you can deal with, if you want to go back and look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6168)|
| 1:42:51| if you really want to look at the people that are on their current plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6171)|
| 1:42:56| I mean, you can change the plan now going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6176)|
| 1:42:58| and you can continue to see what happens nationally on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6178)|
| 1:43:01| They don't have to make that decision today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| You can close the plan, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| You can close the plan, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6185)|
| 1:43:07| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6187)|
| 1:43:08| I mean, that's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6188)|
| 1:43:09| You can close it to new entrants, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6189)|
| 1:43:11| That's what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| You either close the plan and start a new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| That's what the city teachers did, whatever that was, 81 or 2, whatever that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6195)|
| 1:43:21| Yeah, you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| But I think there's kind of two options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| You don't have to just look at the current plan or challenge it, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6205)|
| 1:43:33| Councilman Greer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6213)|
| 1:43:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| One of the things that might be of interest to council, I know it's of interest to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6216)|
| 1:43:40| is that I was talking to Mintha Roach at KUV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6220)|
| 1:43:44| And KUV went through this back in the 90s where they closed their existing plan and started a new one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6224)|
| 1:43:50| And I think it might be interesting to hear from her perspective what that did,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6230)|
| 1:43:55| not only for the employees but also for KUV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6235)|
| 1:43:58| And I did have a discussion with her today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| and she said she'd be more than willing to come and present, you know, that to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6240)|
| 1:44:05| not only give us the written information but then be able to answer questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6245)|
| 1:44:09| And they're right here in our back door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6249)|
| 1:44:11| if that's a consideration at council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6251)|
| 1:44:15| I know it was good information for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6258)|
| 1:44:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6259)|
| 1:44:20| I, too, have discussed not only with Mintha Roach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| but some others changes that have been made to different plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| And I certainly think that the KUV model is one that we could look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6267)|
| 1:44:33| I'm not endorsing anybody's plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6273)|
| 1:44:35| And there are some others that I need to talk a little bit more in detail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6275)|
| 1:44:39| But I do think that we have people in our city who are involved perhaps in the private sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6279)|
| 1:44:46| as well as the public sector that we could talk with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6286)|
| 1:44:50| and find out how they've handled this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6290)|
| 1:44:53| and not only from the perspective of the employer but the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6293)|
| 1:44:59| And that was one of the suggestions that Councilman DeLvopio brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6299)|
| 1:45:02| and I think those are all excellent ideas if you can get the private sector to come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6302)|
| 1:45:08| and it might be a little bit harder to get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6308)|
| 1:45:11| But if somebody knows somebody that's been through it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6311)|
| 1:45:13| I mean, I don't think we can get too much information here, that's for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6313)|
| 1:45:18| What's that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| Yeah, Mintha Roach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6319)|
| 1:45:20| Yeah, but I'm talking about private enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| Yeah, the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6322)|
| 1:45:23| I asked her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6323)|
| 1:45:24| It's both from the employer and the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6324)|
| 1:45:27| Yeah, both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6327)|
| 1:45:29| And I've asked Rhonda Rice at the Chamber if they would check around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| and see if they have companies, because there are a lot of big companies in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| Some of them must have wrestled with this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6336)|
| 1:45:39| Obviously, the economic downturn crashed everyone's plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6339)|
| 1:45:43| and what are people doing to recover is an important question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6343)|
| 1:45:48| In the private sector, folks are not constrained by the same rules that you are in a governmental arena.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6348)|
| 1:45:56| So, for example, if this was a private plan, you could not only close the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6356)|
| 1:46:01| you could freeze the plan so nobody earned anything going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6361)|
| 1:46:06| And then if you wanted to give any benefit, then that would be at your discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6366)|
| 1:46:10| So while I certainly would encourage you to gather whatever information you can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6370)|
| 1:46:14| just be aware that the rules that apply to corporate plans are vastly different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6374)|
| 1:46:20| than the rules that apply to governmental plans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| And you say that even if we change the charter so that the plan is, for example, closed or frozen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6382)|
| 1:46:28| or whatever you mentioned happens in the private sector, doesn't the charter determine what the plan is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6388)|
| 1:46:34| The plan is what the charter allows it to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| Is that not true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6396)|
| 1:46:38| To the extent, you know, if you say Blackwell keeps you from changing provisions from current employees, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6398)|
| 1:46:44| let's say you couldn't change the multiplier from 2.5 to 2.4, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6404)|
| 1:46:49| it would also, quote, unquote, protect from reducing it to zero,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6409)|
| 1:46:54| which is essentially what you can do in a corporate plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6414)|
| 1:46:57| but you can't do it in a private plan in Tennessee due to the Blackwell decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6417)|
| 1:47:01| Do you say that even though Blackwell said no employee has a permanent contract with the government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6421)|
| 1:47:06| and that they work under their arrangement with the government and appointment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6426)|
| 1:47:11| and they have civil service to protect them from unfair firings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6431)|
| 1:47:14| but they don't have a lifetime contract like a judge has?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6434)|
| 1:47:18| I'm just telling you that's my understanding of the rule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6438)|
| 1:47:21| but if one of the attorneys wants to address that, I'd be happy for them to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6441)|
| 1:47:27| Councilman Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6447)|
| 1:47:28| Vice Mayor, I just want to thank the mayor and this presentation tonight, Dr. Lyons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6448)|
| 1:47:34| and Mr. Pennington and Councilman Sanders for what they've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6454)|
| 1:47:39| At least we're out ahead of the problem, before we have a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6459)|
| 1:47:43| So this is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6463)|
| 1:47:46| And I just wanted to make that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6466)|
| 1:47:50| He can always calm a crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6470)|
| 1:47:57| Councilman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6477)|
| 1:47:59| Well, I thought we were out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6479)|
| 1:48:01| He sounded like he was going to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6481)|
| 1:48:03| He heard enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6483)|
| 1:48:04| I was ready to go too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6484)|
| 1:48:07| I just had a question for the people that formed these five different options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6487)|
| 1:48:14| Where exactly did these five options come from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6494)|
| 1:48:18| Were they sort of a reflection of our current system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6498)|
| 1:48:22| Because I think it would be good to have some, just some,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6502)|
| 1:48:26| I don't think we even need people to come in and talk to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6506)|
| 1:48:28| but just what else is out there just so we have perspective?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6508)|
| 1:48:31| Because I think there's certainly many companies that don't provide any contribution to any, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6511)|
| 1:48:38| I think that would be on one end of the scale versus a very rich, defined benefit plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6518)|
| 1:48:44| So I think for everyone involved, just to know what else is out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| because we're going to be talking about competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| I think it would be good if we had, you know, I mean, I know what my law firm does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6530)|
| 1:48:55| You know, they match 50% up to 4%, so a match contribution of 2%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6535)|
| 1:49:01| Defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6541)|
| 1:49:02| Defined contribution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6542)|
| 1:49:03| That's what I get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6543)|
| 1:49:05| If they raise it to eight, I'd love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6545)|
| 1:49:06| You know, I mean, so I think we should know what's out there in the private sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6546)|
| 1:49:12| And I would, I mean, was there, how are these five plans formed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6552)|
| 1:49:17| Well, I think first there was an assumption there would be a pension of some kind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6557)|
| 1:49:22| and that all possible permutations of pensions range from a defined contribution all the way to a defined benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6562)|
| 1:49:29| So basically we thought let's go pure defined benefit, pure defined contribution, and something in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| That would take all, that's assuming, again, that there is a city participation in the retirement of the employee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6574)|
| 1:49:42| which is what would be across all of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6582)|
| 1:49:44| We also made, took the existing, I think we've gotten a little bit away from the existing benefit structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6584)|
| 1:49:49| and decided to reduce that as well by upping the retirement age in all cases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6589)|
| 1:49:54| and increasing the years that you average for highest pay and removing the rule of 80 and those sorts of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6594)|
| 1:50:00| So those were the two sets of considerations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| A, reduce the benefit structure somewhat because it seemed quite rich and it contributed to this whole issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6602)|
| 1:50:07| And B, assume that there would be city participation in the employee's retirement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6607)|
| 1:50:11| and go across the entire range from, you know, from all employee bearing risk to all, to city bearing risk and in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6611)|
| 1:50:18| So in that sense we thought that still leaves lots of different ways to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6618)|
| 1:50:23| And, you know, for sure you could have just a match at whatever level or you could have it as at the law firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6623)|
| 1:50:30| but I think for purposes of discussion we drew those, we put the boundary sticks on those ends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6630)|
| 1:50:35| So, I mean, you didn't look at other cities or look at the private sector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6635)|
| 1:50:39| I mean, these were just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6639)|
| 1:50:41| We looked a lot at other cities, I mean, to get some sense of the lay of the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6641)|
| 1:50:46| I would say if there is a city in the country that varies from pretty much these parameters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6646)|
| 1:50:53| there are very, very few, would you not say that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6653)|
| 1:50:55| No, I would agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6655)|
| 1:50:56| One of the things we particularly looked at is, you know, however you structure the plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6656)|
| 1:51:03| the question is what's the ultimate benefit to the employee?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6663)|
| 1:51:06| Because the ultimate benefit is what drives the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6666)|
| 1:51:09| So how much benefit are we trying to get to the employees, question number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6669)|
| 1:51:14| And question number two is how much risk does the city want to retain, if any, in providing that ultimate benefit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6674)|
| 1:51:24| And so in coming up with these options, I did research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6684)|
| 1:51:27| I looked at what different states are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6687)|
| 1:51:29| I had several conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6689)|
| 1:51:30| I didn't go out and say, well, let's look at what they're doing because I like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6690)|
| 1:51:34| Let's pick that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6694)|
| 1:51:35| We looked at the situation here and said, let's come up with some sort of general frameworks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6695)|
| 1:51:40| that go from kind of this end of the spectrum to this end of the spectrum, present them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6700)|
| 1:51:45| let people consider them, and then flush them out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6705)|
| 1:51:49| And then if one of those seems to feel good, we can, you know, put some more meat on the bones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6709)|
| 1:51:55| And if you guys look at it and say, well, hey, we'd really like one that accomplishes this objective| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6715)|
| 1:52:00| because we don't think we're accomplishing this objective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6720)|
| 1:52:03| But, you know, I think we kind of covered the gambit in terms of, you know, where could you end up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6723)|
| 1:52:10| and, you know, what are the objectives of the pension system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6730)|
| 1:52:13| Those are what we tried to take into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6733)|
| 1:52:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6737)|
| 1:52:18| I mean, I just think it's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| Eventually we're going to be proposing this to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6739)|
| 1:52:22| So, I mean, I think that's one consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6742)|
| 1:52:26| What are the, you know, what is your average taxpayer getting at their employment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6746)|
| 1:52:29| I mean, I think that should be part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6749)|
| 1:52:32| Real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6752)|
| 1:52:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6753)|
| 1:52:34| And going back to what Alan said, we looked at risk allocation between city and employee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6754)|
| 1:52:40| We looked at either the retirement age or the richness of the benefit aspect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6760)|
| 1:52:45| What was the third one you mentioned at least?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6765)|
| 1:52:48| Well, Ryan, we initially had the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6768)|
| 1:52:50| It was the risk allocation, but it was also the total risk in terms of how the assets are invested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6770)|
| 1:52:58| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6778)|
| 1:52:59| Whether we go conservative like a pile of bonds or whether we go heavily into the stock market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6779)|
| 1:53:03| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6783)|
| 1:53:04| That's the idea, just what can we afford to take as a risk in the investment process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6784)|
| 1:53:08| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6788)|
| 1:53:09| Where are we now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6789)|
| 1:53:10| Are we in the middle or where would you say we are?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| You know, if this is the end on what's reasonable in terms of equity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6792)|
| 1:53:16| and this is the end on what's reasonable in terms of fixed income,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6796)|
| 1:53:19| we're clearly on this side of the spectrum right now where we have more equity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6799)|
| 1:53:24| In other words, if somebody said let's put another 15 percent equity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6804)|
| 1:53:27| I don't think anybody would look at that and think that would be a reasonable thing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6807)|
| 1:53:31| Did you buy Apple at $60?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6811)|
| 1:53:32| That would be a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6812)|
| 1:53:34| Sorry, I missed that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6814)|
| 1:53:35| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6815)|
| 1:53:37| I guess my final question is and where I'm coming from is that we have a plan that we're committed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6817)|
| 1:53:46| And I guess the question I have for the administration is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6826)|
| 1:53:50| how do we balance going forward what it is the commitment that we make to the employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6830)|
| 1:53:57| not only the ones that we have but the ones that we're going to hire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6837)|
| 1:54:00| and at the same time we make a commitment to our taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6840)|
| 1:54:04| because there's only going to be so much money in the pot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6844)|
| 1:54:08| And so how are we going to continue to honor the obligations that we have to the taxpayers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6848)|
| 1:54:14| as well as honor the obligations that we have to the employees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6854)|
| 1:54:18| And I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6858)|
| 1:54:19| I'm not looking for an answer for that, but that's where I'm coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6859)|
| 1:54:21| I mean, we have our taxpayers on one side that are paying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6861)|
| 1:54:25| They're footing the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6865)|
| 1:54:26| And I guess that's what you refer to the risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6866)|
| 1:54:29| It's really when we say the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6869)|
| 1:54:31| We're talking about the taxpayers are at risk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6871)|
| 1:54:34| So that's what it boils down to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6874)|
| 1:54:36| We have the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6876)|
| 1:54:37| We have the employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6877)|
| 1:54:38| We have a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6878)|
| 1:54:39| And where are we going to give?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6879)|
| 1:54:41| Are we going to raise taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6881)|
| 1:54:42| Are we going to cut services?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6882)|
| 1:54:43| You know, where are we headed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6883)|
| 1:54:45| And apparently where we are right now is we owe a whole lot of money to make up for what it was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6885)|
| 1:54:50| that we've already committed to, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6890)|
| 1:54:52| And it looks like in the next couple of years we're going to have a big chunk of money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6892)|
| 1:54:56| that we as taxpayers are going to have to pay for the commitments we've made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6896)|
| 1:55:00| So what the question is, and I guess it goes back to Councilman Della Volpe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6900)|
| 1:55:04| is where do we come up with the $20 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6904)|
| 1:55:08| Well, they have to help us, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6908)|
| 1:55:11| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6911)|
| 1:55:12| I'm not asking for an answer to that bill, but you sort of looked like you were going to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6912)|
| 1:55:18| I was going to say we do have to figure out how to pay what the existing obligations are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6918)|
| 1:55:22| That's the short- and medium-term challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6922)|
| 1:55:25| But we have an immediate long-term challenge of changing the plan going out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6925)|
| 1:55:28| And that's why I think, as Mayor O'Hara said at the beginning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6928)|
| 1:55:30| if we can really keep concentrated on that first, we have a deadline for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6930)|
| 1:55:38| So our next meeting is going to be we're going to hear from the employee groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6938)|
| 1:55:45| Is everybody comfortable with still moving forward as we plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6945)|
| 1:55:50| Is that Thursday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6950)|
| 1:55:52| Not this Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6952)|
| 1:55:53| Thursday week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6953)|
| 1:55:55| I think it's the 19th, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6955)|
| 1:56:01| What time is that one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6961)|
| 1:56:02| 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6962)|
| 1:56:03| The rest of them all will be at 5.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6963)|
| 1:56:05| The last one will be in the small assembly room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6965)|
| 1:56:08| I believe it's the 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6968)|
| 1:56:15| Well, that will be at the ñ however you all want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6975)|
| 1:56:19| I'll get in here, whoever you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6979)|
| 1:56:22| You know, all I did was present an outline, and then, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6982)|
| 1:56:26| I knew it would evolve as we got into the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6986)|
| 1:56:29| So it's very flexible, and you all just give me guidance on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6989)|
| 1:56:34| I guess back to your all's point about comparing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6994)|
| 1:56:36| Do you want to compare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6996)|
| 1:56:37| I mean, you've got the University of Tennessee right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6997)|
| 1:56:39| Do you want to look at their program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=6999)|
| 1:56:41| Do you want to look at ñ would that be a benefit to us to look at those programs and compare?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7001)|
| 1:56:46| You talk about ñ they're talking about competition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7006)|
| 1:56:49| I can tell you what we're ñ you know, the private sector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7009)|
| 1:56:51| several of us can speak to that, but do you want to look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| And would that help us any to really ñ to compare what UT's doing or what the state's doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7014)|
| 1:57:01| Wouldn't UT's fall under the ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7021)|
| 1:57:03| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7023)|
| 1:57:04| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7024)|
| 1:57:05| I feel ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7025)|
| 1:57:06| UT has two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7026)|
| 1:57:07| They have one for faculty, which is basically defined contribution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7027)|
| 1:57:10| TIE-CREF, because that's what I'm on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7030)|
| 1:57:12| And then they also have one for the general state employees,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7032)|
| 1:57:15| which is an entire different defined benefit program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7035)|
| 1:57:19| But aren't municipalities and counties throughout the state under a state ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7039)|
| 1:57:24| Yeah, there is ñ none of the big four cities are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7044)|
| 1:57:27| but up to a point there is participation in a state program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7047)|
| 1:57:31| What are they doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7051)|
| 1:57:32| What ñ does that help us any?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7052)|
| 1:57:33| I don't know if it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7053)|
| 1:57:34| I mean, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7054)|
| 1:57:35| Well, it gives you ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7055)|
| 1:57:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7058)|
| 1:57:39| It gives you comparisons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7059)|
| 1:57:40| Well, the reason I mentioned KUV is that they went through the very same process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7060)|
| 1:57:45| that we're going through right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| And what I thought was interesting is we can hear about the program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7068)|
| 1:57:53| how it developed and what the employees did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7073)|
| 1:57:55| and how they reacted in this sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7075)|
| 1:57:58| That's, you know ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7078)|
| 1:58:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7080)|
| 1:58:01| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| I mean, it sounds interesting to me if she can ñ| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7082)|
| 1:58:03| you know, I mean, I'd be in favor of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7083)|
| 1:58:05| So, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7085)|
| 1:58:14| It could be a short presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7094)|
| 1:58:15| Yeah, it doesn't have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7095)|
| 1:58:16| Councilman Saunders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7096)|
| 1:58:17| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7097)|
| 1:58:19| Keep in mind also, and Melissa has a copy of this article that Joe Sullivan wrote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7099)|
| 1:58:24| concerning municipalities that are involved with the TCRS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7104)|
| 1:58:28| the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7108)|
| 1:58:30| I don't know if that's an option for us or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7110)|
| 1:58:34| I don't have a clue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7114)|
| 1:58:36| Well, and I would urge you to call either the council office or Attorney Frost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7116)|
| 1:58:42| and let them know your wishes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| But let's do it, you know, let's be as quick as we can about it to get people, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7125)|
| 1:58:50| on our schedule if we may.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7130)|
| 1:58:56| Any other business to come before us this evening?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7136)|
| 1:58:58| Thank you so much for your in-depth answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7138)|
| 1:59:02| It's very, very beneficial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7142)|
| 1:59:05| Bill, is there any closing statement that the administration would like to make?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7145)|
| 1:59:09| We just look forward to working with you on this and being as supportive as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7149)|
| 1:59:13| It's obviously a very, very challenging situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7153)|
| 1:59:16| And we have to have two meetings, two public meetings in May to actually adopt something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7156)|
| 1:59:21| that will go to the pension board to consider before it gets to the ballot, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7161)|
| 1:59:29| Two separate meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7169)|
| 1:59:39| Are we adjourned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7179)|
| 1:59:40| Okay, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncilwsr3877120409?start=7180)|
