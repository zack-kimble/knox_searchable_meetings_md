| 0:12:25| It's great to see everybody here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=745)|
| 0:12:29| So just to give people a little geographic orientation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| I think that most may be familiar with the project location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=753)|
| 0:12:38| but just in case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=758)|
| 0:12:40| we're looking at a map right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=760)|
| 0:12:43| that shows sort of just east of the old city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| if you can see that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=766)|
| 0:12:48| And all of these parcels that are highlighted here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| are part of the overall project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=772)|
| 0:12:54| and these are owned by Mr. Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| And the blue highlighted part is the proposed stadium site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| So all of this property right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=784)|
| 0:13:07| is in a former meatpacking district actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=787)|
| 0:13:11| just again, east of the old city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=791)|
| 0:13:14| and it's privately owned by Mr. Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=794)|
| 0:13:16| So we'll talk a little bit about what that means| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| and how that would happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| as far as the development of the stadium project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=800)|
| 0:13:23| but just wanted to give everyone an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=803)|
| 0:13:25| of how this project has the potential of tying together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=805)|
| 0:13:30| our old city and downtown Knoxville and east Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=810)|
| 0:13:36| And you see the proximity to Austin Homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=816)|
| 0:13:39| and some area businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| We have some schools, Green Magnet Academy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=820)|
| 0:13:45| and Vine is over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=825)|
| 0:13:47| So a really great tie-in, I think, opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=827)|
| 0:13:52| between the downtown area and east Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=832)|
| 0:13:57| So we just wanted you to see that site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| and I'll move us to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=841)|
| 0:14:05| So this stadium project is really important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=845)|
| 0:14:11| as we've discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=851)|
| 0:14:12| and let's give you some background information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=852)|
| 0:14:14| on our stadium project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=854)|
| 0:14:17| The stadium would be publicly owned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=857)|
| 0:14:19| by the Sports Authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| which was created by resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=861)|
| 0:14:24| of City Council and County Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=864)|
| 0:14:27| Mr. Boyd and Boyd Sports would donate the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=867)|
| 0:14:31| for the stadium for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=871)|
| 0:14:35| The stadium would then be leased to Boyd Sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=875)|
| 0:14:39| for Tennessee Smokies baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=879)|
| 0:14:41| So all that is handled through the Sports Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| City and County will have guaranteed booking dates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| for a set number of community events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=890)|
| 0:14:54| Normally in deals like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=894)|
| 0:14:56| we see that number being around seven or 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| Boyd Sports will market the stadium for events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=900)|
| 0:15:03| such as concerts, festival, and other events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=903)|
| 0:15:07| I think in speaking with Boyd Sports and their team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=907)|
| 0:15:12| I think they would like to see this venue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=912)|
| 0:15:15| having around 200 events a year, including baseball games.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=915)|
| 0:15:20| And the gym community development group| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=920)|
| 0:15:23| will lead the private development around the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=923)|
| 0:15:26| And so that's the $140 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=926)|
| 0:15:29| that Mayor Jacobs spoke about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| And that's some background information for you to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=932)|
| 0:15:39| So I know one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=939)|
| 0:15:40| that's been really important to both mayors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=940)|
| 0:15:43| and we've heard how important this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=943)|
| 0:15:45| to council and commission and the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=945)|
| 0:15:49| is how this project would benefit the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=949)|
| 0:15:53| I think both mayors have been really clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=953)|
| 0:15:55| that their support is really contingent on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=955)|
| 0:15:59| that there need to be clear benefits to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=959)|
| 0:16:03| And what's been really exciting, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=963)|
| 0:16:05| for the team that's been working with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=965)|
| 0:16:08| the team from the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=968)|
| 0:16:09| who've been working with Boyd Sports and his team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| and Mr. Boyd's team, they haven't hesitated in any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=972)|
| 0:16:17| to engage in very meaningful conversation around this topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=977)|
| 0:16:22| how they can give back to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| I think, as was stated in some of the introductory comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| and my own interaction with Mr. Boyd,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=988)|
| 0:16:30| this is his history of philanthropy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=990)|
| 0:16:33| and obviously he's a businessman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=993)|
| 0:16:35| but wants to make sure that the project's gonna be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=995)|
| 0:16:38| a benefit to his hometown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| So you can see some of the overall benefits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| of this type of project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1005)|
| 0:16:47| which Chris Caldwell spoke of a little bit earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1007)|
| 0:16:50| but we're talking about a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1010)|
| 0:16:53| that's been vacant for a couple of decades| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1013)|
| 0:16:55| and is really at this point a blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| The public amenity that is provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1019)|
| 0:17:01| to the surrounding community would be huge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1021)|
| 0:17:05| not only from the redevelopment of the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1025)|
| 0:17:07| but also if we think about this multipurpose venue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1027)|
| 0:17:11| they operate really as more of a park type setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1031)|
| 0:17:16| and offer a variety of opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| for recreation at all times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| This is civic furniture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1045)|
| 0:17:26| I think this is a term that Mayor Jacobs used earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1046)|
| 0:17:30| and thinking about how we retain our talent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1050)|
| 0:17:34| and recruit really good jobs to our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1054)|
| 0:17:38| When we compare ourselves to similar cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1058)|
| 0:17:40| across the Southeast and really across the country,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1060)|
| 0:17:43| having those amenities that offer entertainment venues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1063)|
| 0:17:47| that offer sort of that wow factor for a city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1067)|
| 0:17:52| civic furniture is really important to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1072)|
| 0:17:55| A stadium of this type clearly fits into that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1075)|
| 0:18:00| Jobs, obviously there will be jobs associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1080)|
| 0:18:05| not only with the stadium and the activities at the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| but also the small businesses that are able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1091)|
| 0:18:14| to take advantage of that opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1094)|
| 0:18:16| for additional tourism and visitors to downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1096)|
| 0:18:21| in the vicinity of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1101)|
| 0:18:24| Teams provide civic pride,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1104)|
| 0:18:25| and we obviously have a great set of university teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1105)|
| 0:18:31| and even high school teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| that offer that opportunity for our community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1113)|
| 0:18:35| but to bring a professional sports team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1115)|

| 0:21:32| I know many of you all, a lot of your questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| are directed to how we're gonna finance things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| How can we afford a new stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1296)|
| 0:21:38| And we're gonna spend the next few slides discussing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1298)|
| 0:21:42| One thing that I think it's important to realize| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1302)|
| 0:21:45| is that this is not an aberration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1305)|
| 0:21:47| for Randy to come to Knoxville and Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| and Knox County to reach out to Randy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1310)|
| 0:21:52| to talk about the public entities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| being involved in stadium financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1315)|
| 0:21:57| The vast majority of stadiums in the United States| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| are either publicly owned and publicly supported| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| or get significant public support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1323)|
| 0:22:05| during the construction process in some form or another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1325)|
| 0:22:08| So it's by far an aberration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| for there not to be a very substantial public involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| Most communities still consider stadiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1336)|
| 0:22:19| to be part of the civic furniture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| that Stephanie was talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1341)|
| 0:22:23| that makes it a part of the fabric of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1343)|
| 0:22:28| And so what you're being asked to consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1348)|
| 0:22:31| is certainly not an aberration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| In fact, it's consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| Does it make it right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1353)|
| 0:22:34| I'm sure there are many who will say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1354)|
| 0:22:38| that doesn't always make sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1358)|
| 0:22:39| And I'm sure that there's some fair points there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| but it is important to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| that publicly financed stadiums are the norm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1362)|
| 0:22:46| instead of the exception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| This is particularly true in minor league baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| Minor league baseball is not like NFL or even MLS,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1371)|
| 0:22:55| the largest soccer league.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| It is not nearly as profitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1378)|
| 0:22:59| The ticket prices are much lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| It is a small town, small city enterprise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1381)|
| 0:23:06| that is the core of Americana, many people would argue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1386)|
| 0:23:10| and it is not, and most minor league stadiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1390)|
| 0:23:13| are publicly owned and publicly supported.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1393)|
| 0:23:19| The most recent ones, I looked at both seven or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| that are under construction or just recently opened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1402)|
| 0:23:29| and they all have very substantial public support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1409)|
| 0:23:32| I was amused, I was looking in Las Vegas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1412)|
| 0:23:35| They're actually there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| It is gonna be a privately owned stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| but the city of Las Vegas paid the adjoining suburb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1418)|
| 0:23:41| where the stadium is gonna be located $80 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1421)|
| 0:23:45| toward the stadium, roughly half the cost of the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1425)|
| 0:23:47| just so they could call it the Las Vegas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| whatever it is, baseball team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| because they were embarrassed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1431)|
| 0:23:52| It would be like us paying, Knoxville paying Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1432)|
| 0:23:54| to call the team that was located in Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1434)|

| 0:23:58| just to call it after Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1438)|
| 0:24:00| And so it just shows what lengths people will go to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| to support and to try to retain the civic pride.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1444)|
| 0:24:07| Again, doesn't make it right or wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1447)|
| 0:24:10| but there are substantial public contributions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1450)|

| 0:24:18| And this has been historically very much the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1458)|
| 0:24:21| I'm an amateur historian and love reading of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1461)|
| 0:24:26| I'm sure many of you all know more than I do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1466)|
| 0:24:28| but the public stadiums have been very common| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| in the United States for well over a hundred years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1471)|
| 0:24:34| The first huge baseball stadium that was financed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1474)|
| 0:24:37| as a municipal stadium was by Cleveland,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| roughly a hundred years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| And as Mayor Kincannon mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1480)|
| 0:24:42| we've been playing professional baseball in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1482)|
| 0:24:45| well over a hundred years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1485)|
| 0:24:46| In fact, the first games were in the late 1800s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1486)|
| 0:24:49| And then they played in Chile Park for a little while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| before moving over to Kanzler in 1921,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1491)|
| 0:24:56| where they played at Bill Meyer Stadium until the 1990s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| So it is a long history| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| of municipal baseball stadiums in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| And back then, it really was only baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| Here, you're gonna see a much broader use of the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1509)|
| 0:25:12| than just one sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1512)|
| 0:25:17| Stephanie, we'll go to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| So as Stephanie mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| this is the stadium in Fort Wayne, Indiana| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1520)|
| 0:25:25| that both the county officials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1525)|
| 0:25:26| and the city officials went to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1526)|
| 0:25:30| The mayor there is a very energetic fellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| who would love to come tell you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| how this stadium has totally transformed his city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1533)|
| 0:25:36| He was a very friendly, welcoming, came meet both officials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1536)|
| 0:25:41| And you can see it's very similarly adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1541)|
| 0:25:45| to their downtown, not quite in the core of downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1545)|
| 0:25:50| But I know many of you all have asked for stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| where stadiums have made a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1553)|
| 0:25:55| This is certainly not the only one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1555)|
| 0:25:57| There's been roughly 30 minor league stadiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1557)|
| 0:26:00| built in the 2000s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1560)|
| 0:26:02| And this is just one of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| This stadium, though, is a similar size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1564)|
| 0:26:07| to what we would be looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| We would be slightly bigger stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| This team is a, right now, a lower A-level team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| And it's kind of ironic to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| So this is a smaller team than we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1577)|
| 0:26:20| Padres affiliated while we're with the Cubs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| which is obviously probably one of two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| or three iconic baseball brands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| And they still draw incredible numbers in the summer there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| And it's a huge part of the fabric of that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| And we certainly will bring you good stories| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| and the bad stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1597)|
| 0:26:40| Are there bad stories of stadiums gone awry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1600)|
| 0:26:42| Sure, you can find those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1602)|
| 0:26:45| And when do they normally happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1605)|
| 0:26:46| They normally happen when communities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1606)|
| 0:26:48| try to bite off more than they can chew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1608)|
| 0:26:51| For example, the NHL team outside of Phoenix| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1611)|
| 0:26:55| tried to, where they're located, Glendale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1615)|
| 0:26:58| was not really big enough as a major league sports city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1618)|
| 0:27:00| And they borrowed too much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1620)|
| 0:27:02| and challenged themselves too much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1622)|
| 0:27:04| And that usually happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1624)|
| 0:27:07| And you know what the other main,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1627)|
| 0:27:09| to me, the other main factor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1629)|
| 0:27:10| where stadiums don't work well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1630)|
| 0:27:11| is where the owner is not committed to the hometown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1631)|
| 0:27:15| Where you have an out-of-town owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| who's just shopping his team around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1636)|
| 0:27:18| trying to find the best deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1638)|
| 0:27:19| is where you often go awry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| And here, we just don't have that circumstance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| We have a dedicated local owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| who wants the team to be here in his hometown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1645)|
| 0:27:28| And I think that really sets us apart| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1648)|
| 0:27:31| from a lot of other stadium deals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1651)|
| 0:27:32| that have gone awry across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1652)|
| 0:27:35| This stadium here has been very successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1655)|
| 0:27:37| It's owned by the same fellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1657)|
| 0:27:39| who owns the Chattanooga Lookouts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1659)|
| 0:27:40| that you'll hear a little bit more about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1660)|
| 0:27:42| as we go through the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1662)|
| 0:27:43| So we have some good connections here with this owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| because they're trying to do a very similar project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1666)|
| 0:27:49| to what we're trying to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1669)|
| 0:27:50| as with their Double A team down in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| So anyway, it's a beautiful stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1675)|
| 0:27:57| very similar amenities to what we would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1677)|
| 0:28:00| but not nearly as cool as Knoxville will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1680)|
| 0:28:02| Because as you can see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1682)|
| 0:28:03| they have some development around it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| but they don't have the sort of Wrigleyville-type concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1684)|
| 0:28:10| that Randy and his team have in mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1690)|
| 0:28:12| where the residential is even more incorporated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| into the stadium development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| as well as some of the retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1698)|
| 0:28:23| So Sports Authorities is another,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1703)|
| 0:28:26| been a lot of discussion about our sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1706)|
| 0:28:30| and our initial efforts to form one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| which we formed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1712)|
| 0:28:33| And as you know, we'll come back later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1713)|
| 0:28:35| ask for the two governing bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1715)|
| 0:28:38| to approve board members to the Sports Authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| But again, trying to emphasize to you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1722)|
| 0:28:45| that what we're considering here is not an aberration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1725)|
| 0:28:47| In fact, it's consistent with what we've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| across the state in recent years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1729)|
| 0:28:52| Since 2000, there really have been six major stadiums| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| financed in Tennessee, four in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1736)|
| 0:28:59| and two in Memphis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| The new MLS Stadium just closed the financing in December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1742)|
| 0:29:05| That was through their sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| backed by a interlocal agreement from Metro Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1747)|
| 0:29:10| as to what they call their general services district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1750)|

| 0:31:33| And so, this financing is actually the only one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1893)|
| 0:31:36| that's through an Industrial Development Board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1896)|

| 0:31:42| and because it was unlike our project here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1902)|
| 0:31:44| which is a joint project between Knoxville and Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1904)|
| 0:31:50| but it's a good example of a financing that went awry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1910)|
| 0:31:53| because, again, it just did not have sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1913)|

| 0:32:32| using general obligation debt, but if you do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1952)|
| 0:32:34| you generally have to shorten up the lease term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| shorten up the financial commitment of the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| so you're sort of defeating the purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| of having a long-term commitment from a team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| It also means that you've put the taxing power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| of the city and the county behind the debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| and put property tax increases in play by doing this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1969)|
| 0:32:54| and these were much smaller numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=1974)|

| 0:34:32| So Sports Authority issues the bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| The bonds are used to finance the stadium, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| You folks, some folks have said, okay, are these bonds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| what kind of bonds would they be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| It really depends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| Most bonds of this nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2085)|
| 0:34:46| given how low fixed interest rates are on bonds right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2086)|
| 0:34:49| likely would be sold at a fixed rate, be highly rated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2089)|
| 0:34:54| assuming that the city and the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2094)|
| 0:34:57| agree to support this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| and so the rates on the bonds would be very low.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2099)|
| 0:35:03| They would be available for purchase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2103)|

| 0:35:08| They would likely be sold to an underwriter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| and very much like bonds of both the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2110)|
| 0:35:14| and the county are sold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2114)|

| 0:35:48| instead of a city-county structure as we have here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| and so they have an urban services district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| and a general services district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2153)|
| 0:35:55| and so theirs is a little bit different,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| and then obviously Memphis and Shelby County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| essentially partnered on the FedEx Forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2159)|

| 0:36:07| So where do the city and county come in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2167)|
| 0:36:11| If you choose to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2171)|

| 0:36:16| through essentially what I've called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2176)|
| 0:36:18| a shortfall agreement or a funding agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2178)|
| 0:36:20| Many people call it an interlocal agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| where if there's a shortfall in the revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| that are dedicated to pay debt service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| then you would be expected to make up that shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2186)|
| 0:36:32| Under the sports authority law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2192)|
| 0:36:33| you can only pay these months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2193)|
| 0:36:34| from non-property tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| These non-property tax revenues differ greatly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| if you look at the various deals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| Often the biggest source are pilot payments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| that people receive from their utility systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2204)|

| 0:36:50| or pledged to pay debt service from the sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2210)|
| 0:36:53| but it's very important to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| that no property taxes can legally use for this purpose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2214)|
| 0:36:57| and no bondholder could force the city or the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2217)|
| 0:37:01| a bondholder of the sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2221)|

| 0:37:07| by state law and so you would not be pledging| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2227)|
| 0:37:10| your full faith in credit or your taxing power| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2230)|

| 0:37:18| So this chart is, and many of you as we talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2238)|
| 0:37:23| have had questions and answers sessions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| with you individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2246)|

| 0:37:29| that we went over with you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| but hopefully for the public's benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2250)|
| 0:37:32| and for to never hurts to talk twice about things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2252)|
| 0:37:37| is to talk about what are those revenue sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| that we're hoping to use to pay debt service on these bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| So one that you've heard us talk about publicly before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| is the existing law essentially allows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| the capture of the sales tax revenues from the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| So if you go and have popcorn at the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| you normally, the sales tax on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2277)|
| 0:38:00| like the sales tax on any goods in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2280)|
| 0:38:02| is nine and a quarter percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| So the sales tax revenues from that bag of popcorn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2284)|
| 0:38:07| normally seven points, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| 2.25% would go to city county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| and the remainder of 7% would go to the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2294)|
| 0:38:18| So here this law says, nope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| 1.5% will be withheld by the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2302)|
| 0:38:26| and it's generally their BEP funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2306)|
| 0:38:29| and school funds that they have specifically dedicated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2309)|
| 0:38:32| for that purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2312)|
| 0:38:33| So other than that 1.5% of the 9.25%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2313)|
| 0:38:38| i.e. 7.75% would go to pay sports stadium debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| So again, if that saves a dollar for a bag of popcorn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2324)|
| 0:38:47| then what is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2327)|
| 0:38:48| 77.5, 7.75 cents would go towards paying debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2328)|
| 0:38:56| for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2336)|
| 0:38:57| That includes things also in say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2337)|
| 0:38:59| there's a Smokies store in the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2339)|

| 0:39:08| So is that a good source of funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2348)|
| 0:39:10| Well, until we had pandemics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| it was a very reliable source of funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2353)|
| 0:39:15| and we obviously all hope and pray| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2355)|
| 0:39:18| that that will continue to be a very reliable source| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2358)|
| 0:39:20| of funds starting hopefully again this summer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2360)|

| 0:39:54| That sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2394)|
| 0:39:55| And then estimate the sales tax revenues from this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| So we'll, when we come back to you with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| we should have a very good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2400)|
| 0:40:02| based on our very limited knowledge so far| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| of what this likely to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2405)|
| 0:40:06| We think roughly 12 to 18% of the debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2406)|
| 0:40:09| is gonna be payable from this source of revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| Again, this is all very preliminary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2412)|
| 0:40:13| but just trying to give you guys an idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2413)|
| 0:40:15| of what we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2415)|
| 0:40:17| So the next thing, which is something we would ask you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| all to support as legislative bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2419)|
| 0:40:22| is to ask the legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| and we've already been in touch with our legislators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2424)|
| 0:40:26| to do this, is to change the law that I just described| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| to not only include the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2430)|
| 0:40:31| but to include one quarter of a mile| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| from the center of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2434)|
| 0:40:35| As you've heard, Randy Boyd and his team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2435)|
| 0:40:38| intend to expand around $140 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2438)|
| 0:40:41| on a development right around the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2441)|
| 0:40:43| Very substantial retail is included in that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2443)|
| 0:40:47| And when I'm talking substantial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2447)|
| 0:40:48| maybe up to 100,000 square feet of retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2448)|
| 0:40:51| 100,000 square feet of retail produces a lot of sales taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2451)|
| 0:40:56| and that's obviously restaurants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| which generally are a good sales tax producer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2457)|
| 0:41:00| And that quarter mile would not only include| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| Randy's immediate development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| but would also pick up the sort of prime lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| that are not presently owned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| but would probably be developed by other folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2468)|
| 0:41:10| around the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| And so we're asked the legislature to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| We believe that the Chattanooga delegation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2475)|
| 0:41:17| will be asked to join in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| And obviously that's gonna be a very important development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2479)|
| 0:41:22| that we're gonna be watching through the spring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2482)|
| 0:41:24| to see how that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2484)|
| 0:41:25| You know, this revenue source, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| is we think it's gonna be fairly predictable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2487)|
| 0:41:32| We think we will be able to give you a pretty good idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| with a third-party study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| a meaningful third-party analysis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| of how much that's likely to produce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| And certainly it will be somewhat cyclical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| depending on how the economy is doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2505)|
| 0:41:47| but generally sales tax revenues have stayed pretty steady| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2507)|
| 0:41:50| even during this pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2510)|
| 0:41:51| Sales tax revenues have stayed relatively steady| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| in both the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| Obviously if the stadium ever closed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| that's not gonna help,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2519)|
| 0:42:00| but it doesn't mean all the businesses around it would,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2520)|
| 0:42:03| but certainly that would be a diminishing factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2523)|
| 0:42:06| Is this new?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| You know, clearly those sales tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2527)|
| 0:42:10| from the state itself are new sales tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| Right now, all those sales tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| are not located anywhere in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2533)|
| 0:42:16| Here, well, of the 7.75%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2536)|
| 0:42:20| two-thirds of it is definitely new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2540)|
| 0:42:21| That's the state portion of the sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| That's all new money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| So of the third remainder,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2545)|
| 0:42:28| and I've talked about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| some of you have asked about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| is yes, we think a vast majority of it will be new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2550)|
| 0:42:33| Anyone coming from outside of Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2553)|
| 0:42:36| in to watch a game and eats here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2556)|
| 0:42:38| within that quarter mile radius, all new money for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| There will be some, what I call cannibalization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2561)|
| 0:42:45| Instead of, you know, you may come eat at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2565)|
| 0:42:47| you know, Mammoth Hoff's Russian Grill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2567)|
| 0:42:50| there next to the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2570)|
| 0:42:53| but you, and instead of eating at McDonald's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2573)|
| 0:42:57| on Kingston Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2577)|
| 0:42:58| and so you now shifted your sales tax expenditure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2578)|
| 0:43:02| Yeah, there's probably gonna be a small amount of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2582)|
| 0:43:04| but of that amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| we would think that's probably less than 10%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2585)|
| 0:43:07| We don't know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2587)|
| 0:43:08| but we'll certainly ask the third-party consultant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2588)|
| 0:43:09| to estimate that for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| We think this legislation could result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2591)|
| 0:43:14| in a roughly 19 to 30% of the debt surface| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2594)|
| 0:43:18| based on preliminary estimates that we've seen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| from the team of the retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2600)|
| 0:43:22| So next thing was the rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2602)|
| 0:43:24| You know, the team will pay meaningful rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2604)|
| 0:43:26| This is not gonna be like the Titans.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| The team has already acknowledged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| that they're gonna have to pay meaningful rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| We expect that, particularly given who we're dealing with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2612)|
| 0:43:34| to be a very consistent and reliable stream of revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2614)|
| 0:43:40| You know, we've not agreed upon a number yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| but we believe that the likely percentage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2623)|
| 0:43:45| of the debt service payable from this is 22 to 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2625)|
| 0:43:49| Some of you have said, okay, great, get rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2629)|
| 0:43:52| but we also wanna share in all the sort of events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2632)|
| 0:43:54| you know, when the Rolling Stones come play in their 90s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2634)|
| 0:43:58| and, you know, we all make tons of money off that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2638)|
| 0:44:02| We ought to share in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2642)|
| 0:44:03| Well, there's a trade-off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2643)|
| 0:44:04| The trade-off is if we try to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2644)|
| 0:44:06| number one, if you try to share profits from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| it becomes a challenging legal issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2649)|
| 0:44:13| But it's also a tax issue from a federal tax perspective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| You have to do more taxable debt instead of tax-exempt debt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2659)|
| 0:44:22| the more that you rely on private payment streams like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2662)|
| 0:44:25| So there's a real trade-off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2665)|
| 0:44:28| between just getting a agreed fixed payment from the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2668)|
| 0:44:32| versus sharing in, quote, upside of revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2672)|
| 0:44:35| and that's certainly something we'll be negotiating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| Some of the things like naming rights and things like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2678)|
| 0:44:40| that are frequent revenue sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| attributable to a minor league team likely would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2682)|
| 0:44:45| our goal is to try to get a certainty as to rent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2685)|
| 0:44:48| and that the team would be responsible for going out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2688)|
| 0:44:51| and trying to maximize that for their own benefit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2691)|
| 0:44:53| But that's certainly gonna be a point in negotiation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2693)|
| 0:44:55| over the next few months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2695)|
| 0:44:57| But as you see, we estimate this as a 22 to 30%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2697)|
| 0:45:00| You know, this is gonna be contractual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2700)|
| 0:45:03| so there's not really a need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2703)|
| 0:45:04| for a third-party verification on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2704)|
| 0:45:08| So what's the next source of revenue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| As well, as you've heard several times now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| there's gonna be substantial private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| around the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| We're talking about over $140 million Randy is projecting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2715)|
| 0:45:20| and whether they're gonna be able to do that immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2720)|
| 0:45:23| or have to phase it in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| but we're expecting a significant private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2724)|
| 0:45:27| to come out of the ground simultaneously with the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2727)|
| 0:45:30| and I think Randy obviously wants to see that happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2732)|
| 0:45:35| So there'll be substantial new property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2735)|
| 0:45:39| coming off that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2739)|
| 0:45:41| These are all new revenue sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2741)|
| 0:45:42| that increment to the city and county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| There's relatively minimal taxes now there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| because it's a very blighted area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2746)|
| 0:45:49| other than the raw land value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2749)|
| 0:45:51| And so, you know, this is a very consistent change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2751)|
| 0:45:54| and I'm sure some of you are gonna say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2754)|
| 0:45:55| wait a minute, that guy just said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| we can't use property taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2757)|
| 0:45:58| We'd have to structure this like a pilot or a TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| to take advantage of these incremental taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2761)|
| 0:46:04| to be able to dedicate them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| to the debt service on the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2766)|
| 0:46:09| But we think that this is an ongoing negotiation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2769)|
| 0:46:13| that we'll have to have with Randy and his team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2773)|
| 0:46:15| They likely will request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2775)|
| 0:46:18| depending on what their pro forma shows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| some benefit from the incremental tax revenues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| but we're hoping that the benefit to the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| would likely pay somewhere between 17 and 30%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| of the debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| And obviously, how will we know what that'll be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2790)|
| 0:46:32| Once they finalize their design plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2792)|
| 0:46:35| we'll go to the assessor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| we'll ask him to provide us an assessed value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| We can back into the increment based on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2798)|
| 0:46:41| and we'll have a development agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2801)|
| 0:46:42| with the developer saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| committing them to develop a certain amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2805)|
| 0:46:47| that we know will come out of the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2807)|
| 0:46:48| and will be built simultaneously with the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| So we can be assured it's not a field of dreams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2811)|
| 0:46:54| built and then they will come approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| as to a significant part of that development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| So if you add all those things up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2819)|
| 0:47:01| you'll see that things work out well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2821)|
| 0:47:05| Those revenue sources theoretically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2825)|
| 0:47:07| could cover all debt service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2827)|
| 0:47:09| if things work out on the low end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| the city may have to, and the county may have to come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| and make up some difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2834)|
| 0:47:16| from non-property tax revenues of any shortfall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| And obviously that commitment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2839)|
| 0:47:20| would be a very predictable commitment of funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| There certainly will be new funds available to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2844)|
| 0:47:26| We will get you a third party report trying to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2846)|
| 0:47:30| and when I say try,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2850)|
| 0:47:31| it'll estimate what the economic benefit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2851)|
| 0:47:34| outside of that quarter mile will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2854)|
| 0:47:36| and what additional tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2856)|
| 0:47:39| when that Cub fan comes down from Chicago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| to see his favorite double A team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2860)|
| 0:47:43| and stays at a local hotel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2863)|
| 0:47:45| and goes eat downtown or eat Southwest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| And so we'll try to do the best we can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2868)|
| 0:47:50| to estimate what those new revenue sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2870)|
| 0:47:52| will mean to the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2872)|
| 0:47:55| But those will be harder to estimate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2875)|
| 0:47:58| than the other ones that we mentioned above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2878)|
| 0:48:01| But what we've seen so far,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2881)|
| 0:48:03| those estimates would well exceed any exposure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2883)|
| 0:48:06| to the city and the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| but certainly that's something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| that we will be pursuing further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| Thanks so much, Mark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2895)|
| 0:48:16| And I know that folks are writing down their questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2896)|
| 0:48:20| So I feel confident that we'll have questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| about a lot of this information we're sharing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2903)|
| 0:48:26| Before we wrap up and get to the question and answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| just wanted to go over the proposed process and timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2910)|
| 0:48:33| And just to be clear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2913)|
| 0:48:35| all of this is still in proposal stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2915)|
| 0:48:37| So as we lay this out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2917)|
| 0:48:40| I know that folks wanna see a timeline| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2920)|
| 0:48:42| and we have to realize that some of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2922)|
| 0:48:46| can be moving targets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2926)|
| 0:48:48| because we're still in the early stages of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2928)|
| 0:48:52| But our next step is to bring forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2932)|
| 0:48:56| a Sports Authority Board nominees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2936)|

| 0:49:03| I know that we had originally projected February for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2943)|
| 0:49:07| We are getting a lot of interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| Many of you have sent in names and resumes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2948)|
| 0:49:13| of folks who you're hearing from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2953)|
| 0:49:15| Both of the mayor's offices are getting interest on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=2955)|

| 0:54:33| And his primary motivation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| in being a part of this is philanthropic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3275)|

| 0:54:37| but he wants to give back to East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| And so that's why he's our president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3279)|
| 0:54:41| and leading the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3281)|
| 0:54:43| The other investors are people in the local community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3283)|

| 0:54:49| I can say to the person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3289)|
| 0:54:52| primarily motivated by our wanting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3292)|

| 0:54:57| and probably make a bigger return, a safer return,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| but we believe that this is a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3299)|
| 0:55:00| to give back to our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3300)|

| 0:55:09| but so far, all the expenses to develop the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3309)|
| 0:55:13| and pay for feasibility studies and parking studies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3313)|

| 0:55:19| I'm hopeful that if this project is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| that the rest of the group will actually invest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3322)|

| 0:55:29| But I think that's about as far as we are now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| but we have a small group of people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3331)|
| 0:55:33| all local, all driven by philanthropy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3333)|

| 0:55:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3341)|

| 0:55:53| some of those people that try to copy and sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3353)|
| 0:55:58| non-licensed, like jerseys and bats and things like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3358)|
| 0:56:03| Because a lot of that's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3363)|
| 0:56:05| and I wondered if you've got something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3365)|

| 0:56:15| but we're also, with our new affiliation agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3375)|

| 0:56:25| in helping us manage that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3385)|
| 0:56:26| And Major League Baseball, all professional sports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3386)|

| 0:56:38| because something, I think, by the way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3398)|
| 0:56:40| thank you, mayors and Mark and Chris and Stephanie| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| for just what I thought was a brilliant presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3405)|
| 0:56:47| As they were talking, I was thinking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| there's not really anything else to add,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3408)|
| 0:56:50| but I will add this or at least embellish one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| They did mention that we would hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3413)|
| 0:56:55| to have 200 activities a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| We hope to have over 350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3417)|
| 0:56:58| Fort Wayne, who we went to see, they have 350.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3418)|
| 0:57:01| So they can do it, we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3421)|
| 0:57:02| And it's not just about baseball.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3422)|
| 0:57:04| So it's important that I'm a baseball guy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3424)|
| 0:57:06| so I love baseball, but there will be many people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3426)|
| 0:57:09| that love and enjoy this park| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| and never come to a baseball game.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3431)|
| 0:57:13| There'll be family reunions, there'll be weddings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3433)|
| 0:57:15| there'll be farmers markets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| When we went to Fort Wayne one day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| on a given day, we saw two different weddings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| and a farmers market going on all at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| So there's so many things that we can do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| and we can do it all at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3447)|
| 0:57:28| So there's so many ways in which the community can use this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3448)|
| 0:57:30| And again, it's gonna be open dawn till dusk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| So people just go and rather than going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3454)|
| 0:57:36| to West Elm Mall to walk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| they can come to the park and walk around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| But it's a community asset for many things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| not just baseball, even though we will be hoping| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3463)|
| 0:57:46| that you come and buy a ticket 70 nights a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3466)|
| 0:57:48| for baseball too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3468)|
| 0:57:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3469)|

| 0:58:02| from the public and the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3482)|

| 0:58:14| And right now, I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| that everybody knows that this is a proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3496)|

| 0:58:19| So right now, use of the current stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3499)|
| 0:58:22| there's 70 games a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3502)|
| 0:58:24| Are there other days that that stadium is in use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3504)|
| 0:58:30| Yes, there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3510)|

| 0:58:34| I'll say unfortunately, when the stadium was designed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3514)|
| 0:58:37| it wasn't designed purposefully to have concerts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3517)|
| 0:58:39| And there's some technical things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| regarding loading and unloading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3521)|
| 0:58:43| that stadium needs to be able to handle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3523)|
| 0:58:46| We intend to design this stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3526)|
| 0:58:47| so you can load and unload in hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3527)|
| 0:58:49| It takes days at the current stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3529)|
| 0:58:51| which ends up resulting in a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3531)|

| 0:59:20| So from philanthropic to other sports and entertainment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3560)|
| 0:59:26| it's used on a frequent basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3566)|
| 0:59:30| Okay, so obviously, the amount of use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3570)|
| 0:59:33| what you're describing and how you answered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3573)|

| 0:59:38| considerably compared to something like in Fort Wayne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| What kind of staffing increases| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3581)|

| 0:59:46| Like how many staff work at the Fort Wayne Stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| Full-time, part-time, how does that break out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3589)|
| 0:59:52| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3592)|

| 0:59:55| It would be with the Smokies in peak season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3595)|
| 0:59:58| it's around 80, that's just for the baseball staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| With other events, there are a lot of people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3604)|
| 1:00:06| that come in for special events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3606)|
| 1:00:09| But for having a concert, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3609)|
| 1:00:11| that could be a significant number of more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| The thing that's great about the stadium downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3614)|
| 1:00:17| versus in Kodak, there's really nothing around Kodak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3617)|
| 1:00:21| where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| So people, it's a destination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3622)|
| 1:00:24| You drive to the parking lot, you get out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3624)|
| 1:00:26| you go to the stadium and you drive home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| I hear people will walk through downtown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3628)|
| 1:00:30| and stop at all the other venues and restaurants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3630)|
| 1:00:33| And so it has a catalytic effect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3633)|
| 1:00:35| on all the other businesses around the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| And that's, I think, the big win| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| and why so many people like building stadiums downtown now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3638)|
| 1:00:45| Okay, and then I think I won't ask,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3645)|
| 1:00:47| I have tons of questions, but obviously,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3647)|
| 1:00:49| there's lots of people here to ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| I would like for maybe Mr. Mametoff or Caldwell or Welch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3652)|
| 1:00:56| to elaborate on when you guys say we're gonna discuss| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3656)|
| 1:00:59| or the TIF pilot for an adjoining property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| how does that play into potential financing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3663)|
| 1:01:07| If you could elaborate on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3667)|
| 1:01:09| I'll go ahead and mute myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3669)|
| 1:01:13| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3673)|
| 1:01:18| If Mr. Boyd developed $140 million development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3678)|
| 1:01:21| right next to the thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3681)|
| 1:01:22| that would roughly under current tax rates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3682)|
| 1:01:25| generate $2.3 million of additional property tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| if it would just went on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3690)|
| 1:01:32| And as we talked with each of you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| I'm sure if Randy would tell you this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| I'm sure his financial advisors would tell you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| is that a project in this area is a high-risk project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3698)|
| 1:01:42| that he's breaking new ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| going to an area that's not developed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| And typically, we would have a request for a pilot or a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3707)|
| 1:01:51| We would do our normal third-party review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3711)|
| 1:01:53| look at their performance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3713)|
| 1:01:54| decide whether that's appropriate or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| And I'm sure that we will be going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3717)|
| 1:01:58| through that process here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| but you can certainly, Randy can address that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3720)|
| 1:02:04| but it's still at very initial stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3724)|
| 1:02:06| But one thing we're pushing hard on as a negotiating team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3726)|
| 1:02:11| is say, guys, look, we certainly understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3731)|
| 1:02:14| that you may need to ask for some benefit here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3734)|
| 1:02:16| but at the same time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3736)|
| 1:02:17| we need revenue sources to help pay for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| This is a new revenue source,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3740)|
| 1:02:22| the additional tax revenues from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3742)|
| 1:02:24| and therefore we would like to see a big chunk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| of those incremental tax revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3748)|
| 1:02:31| be made available to use for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| And so, depending on how much comes out of the ground| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3753)|
| 1:02:38| immediately, the number would vary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| but let's assume that the assessed value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3761)|
| 1:02:44| was more like $80 million when the stadium opens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3764)|
| 1:02:47| that would be roughly $650,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| of additional tax benefit to the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| So those are the kind of numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| Council Member Ryder, that we would be looking at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3775)|
| 1:02:57| saying, okay, and again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| I don't know how much time you went,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| I can walk you through how the documents would work,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3780)|
| 1:03:02| but it would probably take 10 or 15 minutes to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3782)|
| 1:03:05| But the bottom line is that those monies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| through the appropriate legal processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| would be dedicated to be available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| to pay debt service on the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| as a new revenue source that would otherwise not exist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| if this development did not occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| Does that help?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| It does, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3801)|
| 1:03:22| I didn't know if we were talking about other additional,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| that gives some target to what you were talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| You might be interested in the Sound Stadium in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| they basically put the entire area around it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| in the tip district and said, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3812)|
| 1:03:34| but there they had no commitments for private development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3814)|
| 1:03:37| We're trying to be much more conservative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| and tie it to specific private development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| that would be coming out of the ground the same time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3820)|
| 1:03:43| as the baseball stadium would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3823)|
| 1:03:47| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3827)|

| 1:04:04| our city and county representatives on one meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3844)|

| 1:04:11| My first question is for Deputy to the Mayor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3851)|
| 1:04:14| Stephanie Welch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3854)|
| 1:04:16| And my question for you is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3856)|
| 1:04:19| recognizing that our city budget is comprised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3859)|
| 1:04:21| of a series of projects and needs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| of which this stadium that we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3864)|
| 1:04:26| or this proposal we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3866)|
| 1:04:29| would be one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| would the stadium itself be a driver for a tax increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3870)|
| 1:04:34| Yeah, great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3874)|
| 1:04:35| Thanks so much for your question, Council Member Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3875)|
| 1:04:39| So the short answer to your question is no,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3879)|
| 1:04:41| there's never a single project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3881)|
| 1:04:43| that drives any type of tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3883)|
| 1:04:46| Our budget is a very whole,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3886)|
| 1:04:48| budgeting process is very holistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| We have a large budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3890)|
| 1:04:52| Hopefully you've seen tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3892)|
| 1:04:55| that there are multiple revenue sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3895)|
| 1:04:59| that we've been actually pretty conservative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3899)|
| 1:05:01| when we're thinking about estimating those revenue sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| and how they would apply to paying down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3905)|
| 1:05:08| any type of debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| So given that and given that we really have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3910)|
| 1:05:14| a holistic budgeting process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3914)|
| 1:05:16| that has lots of different factors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| a really large budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3918)|
| 1:05:19| the stadium project and the debt service associated with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3919)|
| 1:05:23| will first of all be shared with the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3923)|
| 1:05:25| So this is really a collaborative process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3925)|
| 1:05:29| and that makes it even smaller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3929)|
| 1:05:33| particularly when we get down to the funding gap| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3933)|
| 1:05:36| that might be there after we account| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3936)|
| 1:05:39| for all of those high probability revenue sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3939)|
| 1:05:43| that Mr. Mametoff went over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3943)|
| 1:05:45| Does that answer your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| It does, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3947)|
| 1:05:48| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3948)|
| 1:05:50| My next question is for Mr. Boyd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3950)|
| 1:05:56| Mr. Boyd, can you discuss with us the ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3956)|

| 1:06:05| for seeking community outreach are gonna look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3965)|

| 1:06:15| And as we get more clarity around the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3975)|
| 1:06:16| that we will be able to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| then we'll do even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3978)|
| 1:06:19| But we've, in particular, had a lot of outreach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3979)|
| 1:06:22| to the East Knoxville community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=3982)|

| 1:12:49| Of the revenue sources that were shown on my chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4369)|
| 1:12:53| the sales tax increment allocations would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| the existing one is 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4376)|

| 1:13:01| The lease with Boyd Sports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4381)|
| 1:13:02| which would be irrespective of the franchise term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4382)|

| 1:13:10| It certainly wouldn't be more than 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4390)|
| 1:13:12| It could be shorter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4392)|

| 1:13:36| I spend a lot of time on financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4416)|

| 1:13:56| but when you have revenue sources| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4436)|

| 1:14:03| I would expect a financial advisor to come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| and want to match the term of the bonds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4446)|
| 1:14:07| with those revenue sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4447)|
| 1:14:09| But certainly that's something that we will fully vet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| and bring back to you a specific recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4452)|
| 1:14:21| I think you're muted or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4461)|
| 1:14:23| All right, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4463)|
| 1:14:29| Council Member Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4469)|
| 1:14:31| something was wrong with your microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4471)|

| 1:14:35| Yep, there you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4475)|
| 1:14:36| Of the other Tennessee stadiums,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4476)|
| 1:14:39| stadiums in Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4479)|
| 1:14:40| what is the term length of their bonds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4480)|
| 1:14:43| Most of them have been 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4483)|
| 1:14:44| Council Member Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4484)|
| 1:14:45| I can get you a list and look at them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4485)|
| 1:14:47| For example, I know the Titan Stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4487)|
| 1:14:48| keep in mind too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4488)|
| 1:14:49| that many of them are refinanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4489)|
| 1:14:50| If you went and look at the most recent bond issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4490)|
| 1:14:52| it may only be 20 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4492)|
| 1:14:53| but that's refinancing a deal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4493)|
| 1:14:55| that originally started at 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4495)|
| 1:14:56| So, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4496)|
| 1:14:58| The, and so that would be the standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4498)|
| 1:15:02| And again, the reason it would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4502)|
| 1:15:03| because most of them are taking advantage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4503)|
| 1:15:05| of the same 30 year increment of the sales taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4505)|
| 1:15:07| that I've referenced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4507)|
| 1:15:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4509)|

| 1:15:13| Thank you, Chairman Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4513)|
| 1:15:15| In the presentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4515)|
| 1:15:16| there was a photograph of Parkview Field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4516)|
| 1:15:20| and it appeared over the right field bleachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4520)|
| 1:15:27| that there was a five-story parking garage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4527)|
| 1:15:29| If, is that, was that actually a parking garage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4529)|
| 1:15:33| And if it is, is that part of their stadium complex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4533)|
| 1:15:39| I think I can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4539)|
| 1:15:40| This is Randy Boyd again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4540)|
| 1:15:42| So, it's not part of the stadium complex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4542)|
| 1:15:43| They built a convention center first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4543)|
| 1:15:45| and the parking garage was attached| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4545)|
| 1:15:47| to the convention center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4547)|
| 1:15:48| which kind of begs a maybe more important question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4548)|
| 1:15:52| One of the things that you try to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4552)|
| 1:15:54| with a downtown stadium is to have people walk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4554)|
| 1:15:58| and have convenient access to the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4558)|
| 1:16:01| but be able to walk past other venues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4561)|
| 1:16:04| And we did a parking study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4564)|
| 1:16:06| and this will be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4566)|
| 1:16:07| that if you haven't all seen this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| I'm sure it's publicly available and we can share it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| But we did do a parking study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| about how many parking spaces are available| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| near the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| Within a quarter mile, there are 1,333 spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4576)|
| 1:16:20| Within a half a mile, there's 7,675.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| We were expecting a 3,000 or 7,000 seat stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| Conventional stadiums, the rule of thumb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| is you need one parking spot for every three seats,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| which would put us in the range| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| of a little over 2,000 parking spots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| which we would have plenty of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4596)|
| 1:16:37| However, being a downtown stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| we imagine a lot more people will be taking an Uber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4599)|
| 1:16:42| walking, biking, taking other modes of transportation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4602)|
| 1:16:45| than you would expect in a suburban park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4605)|
| 1:16:47| But to answer the specific question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4607)|
| 1:16:52| we did not build a parking garage for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| It was already there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4616)|
| 1:16:57| Okay, thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4617)|
| 1:16:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4619)|
| 1:17:00| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4620)|
| 1:17:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4623)|
| 1:17:06| I have several questions for several folks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4626)|
| 1:17:08| so please bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| My first question, I guess, might be for Mr. Mametoff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4631)|
| 1:17:17| At our city council meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4637)|
| 1:17:19| where we voted in favor of the sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4639)|
| 1:17:21| there was brief discussion that public financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| was not a guarantee for this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4646)|
| 1:17:29| Has private financing been explored for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4649)|
| 1:17:35| There was mention of naming rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4655)|
| 1:17:38| another stadium that received 80 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4658)|
| 1:17:41| towards development for naming rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4661)|
| 1:17:45| Has that been considered for this project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4665)|
| 1:17:52| Sorry, Council Member Parker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4672)|
| 1:17:54| I was having a hard time getting the mute button to unclick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4674)|
| 1:17:58| We certainly are exploring everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4678)|
| 1:17:59| We have pushed very hard, and certainly Mr. Boyd is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4679)|
| 1:18:02| and he can address the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4682)|
| 1:18:03| would he build this stadium and privately finance it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4683)|
| 1:18:07| They have told us repeatedly, the answer is no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4687)|
| 1:18:09| It does not make financial sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4689)|
| 1:18:10| They're in a good situation where they are in Sevierville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| That stadium is almost paid for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| And so, no, we don't believe that private financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4696)|
| 1:18:19| is a viable source.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4699)|
| 1:18:20| Naming rights, yes, definitely we're taking naming rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4703)|
| 1:18:24| The question is, do you take them into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4704)|
| 1:18:27| where the city gets the naming rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4707)|
| 1:18:29| and we negotiate with the team,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4709)|
| 1:18:31| or do we encourage the team to sell the naming rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4711)|
| 1:18:33| and we ask for more rent as a result?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4713)|
| 1:18:36| So far, we're going under the second approach| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| of letting the team run with the naming rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4719)|
| 1:18:43| And you can argue either side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4723)|
| 1:18:45| and we look forward to getting input| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4725)|
| 1:18:46| from all of you on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4726)|
| 1:18:48| But generally, where Sevierville retained the naming rights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4728)|
| 1:18:51| they never sold them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4731)|
| 1:18:52| because cities are not really in the business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4732)|
| 1:18:54| of selling or administering naming rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4734)|
| 1:18:57| Someone who buys naming rights, why do they do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4737)|
| 1:18:59| They not only want to see their name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| all over Parkview Field, they want their box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| They want to bring people there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| There's all kinds of benefits associated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4745)|
| 1:19:07| that are much better administered by the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| than by the civic entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4749)|
| 1:19:10| And so, it's much better to let the team do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4750)|
| 1:19:13| The stadiums in Nashville, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4753)|
| 1:19:15| the Titans, they get the naming rights from there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4755)|
| 1:19:18| and are not paying rent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| while here, obviously, we're negotiating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4760)|
| 1:19:22| for significant rent from the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4762)|
| 1:19:24| So, I think Mr. Boyd probably would be in a better position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4764)|
| 1:19:27| to comment on whether this could be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4767)|
| 1:19:29| with private financing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4769)|
| 1:19:31| but the only private financing would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4771)|
| 1:19:32| if the team itself did it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| And I guess I would, if you don't mind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4774)|
| 1:19:36| I would encourage him to also respond to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4776)|
| 1:19:40| I just have to say that I agree with Mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| or echo his comment that we simply couldn't afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4783)|
| 1:19:45| to pay for a stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4785)|
| 1:19:46| We're happy with where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4786)|
| 1:19:47| And I'd maybe take this moment to give a shout out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4787)|
| 1:19:51| to the people of Sevierville and Sevier County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4791)|
| 1:19:52| and their public leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4792)|
| 1:19:54| They provided a great venue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4794)|
| 1:19:55| and a great support for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4795)|
| 1:19:57| It's economically very viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| If we were just wanting to make money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| we'd just stay where we're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4802)|
| 1:20:04| The problem with a team or any individual owning a stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4804)|
| 1:20:09| is that we don't get to capture 80, 90%| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4809)|
| 1:20:12| of where the revenue comes from to pay for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4812)|
| 1:20:15| And that's through the increases in sales taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4815)|
| 1:20:16| a public entity can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4816)|
| 1:20:18| How you pay for the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4818)|
| 1:20:19| is through the increases in sales taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4819)|
| 1:20:21| And unfortunately, I don't get, I'm not a taxing authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4821)|
| 1:20:23| so I don't get a chance to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4823)|
| 1:20:25| The only way I make money is through ticket sales| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4825)|
| 1:20:27| and selling popcorn and a few endorsements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4827)|
| 1:20:31| So it's just not economically viable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| for us to pay for the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| And while I have you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4837)|
| 1:20:38| let me ask you another couple of questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4838)|
| 1:20:42| Mr. Boyd, if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4842)|
| 1:20:45| One question I had was if you could remind us all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| of the year that you acquired the Smokies team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4849)|
| 1:20:55| About the team in 2014, 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4855)|
| 1:20:59| In 2013.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| So that's, to me, it seems like a pretty recent acquisition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4861)|
| 1:21:07| It'd be seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4867)|
| 1:21:08| Seven years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4868)|
| 1:21:09| And so there could be financial challenges down the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4869)|
| 1:21:15| That could prevent you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| or force you as the owner to have to sell| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4877)|
| 1:21:20| at some point in the next 30 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4880)|
| 1:21:22| Is that not true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4882)|
| 1:21:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4883)|
| 1:21:24| I remember a story that when they asked Lamar Hunt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4884)|
| 1:21:28| when he bought the Kansas City Chiefs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4888)|
| 1:21:30| Now, I'm not Lamar Hunt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| but they were losing like a million dollars a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4892)|
| 1:21:34| when the AFL started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4894)|
| 1:21:36| And somebody said, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4896)|
| 1:21:37| how much longer can you afford| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4897)|
| 1:21:38| to lose a million dollars a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4898)|
| 1:21:40| He said, about another thousand years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4900)|
| 1:21:43| I'm not Lamar Hunt, and we don't-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| We're not planning on losing a million dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| but we have the resources to continue to support this team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4907)|
| 1:21:51| for as long as we live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4911)|
| 1:21:53| Another question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4913)|
| 1:21:56| I appreciate the history of this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4916)|

| 1:22:07| if we are concerned about the impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4927)|
| 1:22:13| that urban renewal had on East Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4933)|

| 1:22:32| did you ever consider donating your land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4952)|

| 1:22:58| Yeah, let me say, first off, with regards to urban renewal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4978)|
| 1:23:02| I want to make sure that everybody is clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| that this particular part of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4984)|
| 1:23:07| that I acquired was never part of urban renewal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4987)|
| 1:23:10| By 1921, the Lays Packing Company built this facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4990)|

| 1:23:15| So I just want to make sure that it's clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4995)|
| 1:23:17| that it is separate from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4997)|
| 1:23:19| My personal belief is that a baseball stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=4999)|
| 1:23:25| a park, multi-use park that can create 3,000 jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5005)|

| 1:25:08| that this is just within this very small footprint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5108)|
| 1:25:11| of the 12 acres that we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5111)|

| 1:25:16| When Fort Wayne invested in their stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5116)|

| 1:25:20| In the last 12 years, they've had $1.1 billion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5120)|

| 1:25:28| and every estimate that Mark has been making tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5128)|
| 1:25:31| he's not including anything beyond| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5131)|

| 1:25:37| on the rest of the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5137)|
| 1:25:38| is where the biggest upside for the community will be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| But the report on the jobs, what I mentioned, the 3,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| we had an outside consultant do the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5145)|
| 1:25:48| and that's available to all of you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5148)|
| 1:25:50| which we'll make sure that it gets sent to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5150)|

| 1:25:55| Mr. Mammothoff, I have an additional question for you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| if you don't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5158)|
| 1:26:01| You mentioned with the financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| that the team, in addition to naming rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5164)|
| 1:26:09| and what you all are trying to negotiate on that end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5169)|
| 1:26:14| the team would have rights to other revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5174)|
| 1:26:18| And I'm just a little confused| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5178)|
| 1:26:19| if the city and county are building the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| it's publicly owned by the sports authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5182)|
| 1:26:25| the team is renting to use the space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5185)|
| 1:26:28| How do they have interest in other revenue produced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5188)|
| 1:26:33| There will be a master lease to the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| They will be leasing the entire stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5195)|
| 1:26:37| They will be the ones, say we have a concert| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| in the summertime that they bring in a person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5200)|
| 1:26:43| that's their concert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5203)|
| 1:26:45| the way we're presently contemplating this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| In other words, they are the master tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5208)|
| 1:26:50| and the lease will provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5210)|
| 1:26:52| that they have to use every effort they can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5212)|
| 1:26:54| to maximize the use of the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5214)|
| 1:26:56| to try to create the kind of events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| that will drive sales tax revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5219)|
| 1:27:01| So instead of having an independent operator,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5221)|
| 1:27:04| for example, a manager, as we do at the Civic Coliseum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5224)|
| 1:27:08| the team would serve in that role.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5228)|
| 1:27:10| They would be the ones bringing in the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| Like when typically when there's event at the Civic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5233)|
| 1:27:17| they rent and you have a promoter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| and they get the profits essentially here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| the team would bring in the promoter and do the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5241)|
| 1:27:24| So there will be weddings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| there'll be business meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5246)|
| 1:27:31| if it's like Fort Wayne, there'll be reunions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5251)|
| 1:27:35| there's all kinds of events that the team would run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5255)|
| 1:27:38| We would have the right to use the facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5258)|
| 1:27:40| as a community for say civic events,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5260)|
| 1:27:43| a certain number of days a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5263)|
| 1:27:44| We've seen that typically that's seven to 10 days a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| so that we can have true public events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5267)|
| 1:27:50| that are not intended to be moneymakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5270)|
| 1:27:53| but the ongoing revenues from the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5273)|
| 1:27:56| would be for the benefit of the team.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5276)|
| 1:27:58| Now, as I said, we can negotiate that differently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| in Madison, Alabama, which is the most recent AA team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5281)|
| 1:28:05| that it was supposed that their stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| would have come online this year, except for the pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| They negotiated to basically say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| okay, we'll get a share of the upside of the revenues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5292)|
| 1:28:16| and you'll pay a minimum around rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5296)|
| 1:28:18| Of course, that resulted them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5298)|
| 1:28:20| in having to finance the entire stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5300)|
| 1:28:22| with taxable debt at a higher interest rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5302)|
| 1:28:24| So there's a trade-off between wanting to share| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5304)|
| 1:28:27| in the upside of the revenues versus the cost of your debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| So that's something we'll be looking at carefully| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| with financial advisors as we proceed with this process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5312)|
| 1:28:36| but the ongoing day-to-day revenue from events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5316)|
| 1:28:41| at the stadium would be the team's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5321)|

| 1:28:46| And so that's what I was referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5326)|
| 1:28:50| Does that also, if I could jump in for just a second,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| that also includes of course the maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5333)|
| 1:28:55| and insurance and operations and that the master tenant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| is responsible for the day-to-day maintenance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| and operations and taxing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5342)|
| 1:29:04| That's certainly our goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5344)|
| 1:29:05| Randy is probably like going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5345)|
| 1:29:06| I haven't agreed to all this stuff yet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5346)|
| 1:29:08| but certainly that's what we're negotiating is that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| And there's many things to negotiate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| We wanna make sure the stadium is well kept up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| and we mutually need to agree on a capital reserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5356)|
| 1:29:18| to make sure a certain amount of money is set aside each year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| to make sure that that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5360)|
| 1:29:22| But yeah, I mean, Randy's team, negotiating team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5362)|
| 1:29:25| is just, I think everyone wants to try to see if we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5365)|
| 1:29:30| because they care about the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5370)|
| 1:29:31| they're a whole lot easier to work with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5371)|
| 1:29:34| than someone who's, again, a lot of these teams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5374)|
| 1:29:38| and Randy can address this better than I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| I mean, they shop their teams around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5379)|
| 1:29:41| and it used to be like, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5381)|
| 1:29:43| who will give me the best deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5383)|
| 1:29:45| I mean, and we're very fortunate again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| that we have a team owner that wants to be here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5388)|
| 1:29:50| in our communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| Councilman Parker, if I could go to Commissioner Smith| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5393)|
| 1:29:58| and again, if you'd like to have more questions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| and just keep your hand up and I'll keep rotating through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| to give others an opportunity as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5402)|
| 1:30:05| Commissioner Smith, if you could unmute and next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5405)|
| 1:30:11| Okay, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5411)|
| 1:30:14| You guys just kind of touched on two of my questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5414)|
| 1:30:16| That was the annual operating costs to the sports authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5416)|
| 1:30:20| and the set aside for capital upkeep of the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5420)|
| 1:30:23| And Mark, I think what I just heard was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5423)|
| 1:30:26| that is yet to be determined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5426)|
| 1:30:30| Well, the operating expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| we definitely think will be something that the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| would take on as part of their rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5434)|
| 1:30:37| The capital expenditures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5437)|
| 1:30:38| there are various models out there on how to set aside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5438)|
| 1:30:42| a certain percentage each year to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5442)|
| 1:30:43| And we all need to learn a little bit more about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5443)|
| 1:30:46| And once we get better pricing on the stadium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5446)|
| 1:30:48| appreciation, we'll need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5448)|
| 1:30:51| I mean, obviously the first few years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5451)|
| 1:30:52| you'll be in the honeymoon period| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5452)|
| 1:30:54| where very few capital expenditures will be needed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| but there's nothing worse than letting a public asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| run down and so we wanna make sure we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5459)|
| 1:31:01| So yes, I mean, we definitely have that on our radar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5461)|
| 1:31:03| It definitely will be part of any ultimate resolution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5463)|
| 1:31:07| to have a capital reserve methodology established| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| and funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5470)|
| 1:31:11| And we've obviously got to negotiate exactly how,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5471)|
| 1:31:14| where those funds will come from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5474)|
| 1:31:15| and who's responsible for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5475)|
| 1:31:16| But certainly our negotiating point right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| is that the operating expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5480)|
| 1:31:22| the day they operate would be part of the team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| and as part of their leads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| Okay, and on your chart for Lockley Revenue Sources,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| if you take the low end, it comes to about 70%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5491)|
| 1:31:35| If you take the high end, it comes to 128.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5495)|
| 1:31:38| There's mention of a third party review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5498)|
| 1:31:41| Do we know who that third party would be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| and what data would they use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5504)|
| 1:31:46| for coming up with their projections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5506)|
| 1:31:49| So there are, I know, I'm kidding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5509)|
| 1:31:51| but I know you'll be shocked by this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5511)|
| 1:31:53| There are experts in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5513)|
| 1:31:54| There's about five sports facility consulting firms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5514)|
| 1:31:57| that are fairly, I don't wanna say fairly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5517)|
| 1:32:00| they're well regarded in this area that do consulting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5520)|
| 1:32:04| We're gonna do an RFP to make sure that we get someone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5524)|
| 1:32:08| particularly wanna focus on people that have looked at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5528)|
| 1:32:10| from the public side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| that one of Randy's positive attributes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| is you can pick up from his,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5536)|
| 1:32:19| with him, the glass is not only half full,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| it's half full and it's spilling over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5540)|
| 1:32:22| I'm about a half full, I guess, sort of guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5542)|
| 1:32:24| And so he's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5544)|
| 1:32:25| I am conservative because I wanna try to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5545)|
| 1:32:28| I don't want to mislead you guys in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5548)|
| 1:32:31| And he certainly doesn't want to either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5551)|
| 1:32:32| It's just their estimates are very, very strong| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| that they've gotten with their own consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| And obviously we would like to have independent verification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| of those numbers and we will be doing an RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| and sending it out to at least five firms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5565)|
| 1:32:47| who have expertise in sports consulting to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5567)|
| 1:32:51| Okay, and will this third party review of our estimates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5571)|
| 1:32:55| be something that we get before we finalize negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5575)|
| 1:33:02| so that we have some more solid numbers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5582)|
| 1:33:05| to be negotiating from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5585)|
| 1:33:06| Definitely, we hope to get the RFP out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5586)|
| 1:33:11| within the next two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| and would hope to have something back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5592)|
| 1:33:14| certainly by sometime in March, probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5594)|
| 1:33:17| I don't really know how long this is gonna take,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5597)|
| 1:33:19| Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5599)|
| 1:33:20| but I would think that probably it's a 60 day process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| or so to get this information back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5603)|
| 1:33:25| Okay, and my last question is in that same chart,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| the sales tax and surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5608)|
| 1:33:32| is estimated to be 19 to 30% of debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5612)|
| 1:33:39| Is that based upon all of the development being concurrent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| and opening at the same time of the stadium?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| And if not, what does that do to that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| So that number that I use is sort of a conservative take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5629)|
| 1:33:55| on the team's estimates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5635)|
| 1:33:56| And more than 19% was on the low end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5636)|
| 1:33:59| like when they start and 30% was on the high end| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5639)|
| 1:34:04| sort of where they finish up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5644)|
| 1:34:05| So it does take into account phasing to some extent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5648)|
| 1:34:09| but the low end 19% really is assuming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5649)|
| 1:34:13| that only maybe 70% roughly of the retail space| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5653)|
| 1:34:18| they're projecting would get constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5658)|
| 1:34:20| Okay, that's the team and Mr. Boyd provided us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5660)|
| 1:34:25| for the timeframe of when the outside development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5665)|
| 1:34:27| will take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5667)|
| 1:34:29| Well, that's certainly something we're negotiating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5669)|
| 1:34:31| Obviously, Mr. Boyd can address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5671)|
| 1:34:32| I mean, if you ask Randy what you can right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| he'll tell you he wants to finish it tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| But it's certainly something, this is a massive development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| that would have to be phased in over a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5680)|
| 1:34:41| And he's in an opportunity zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5681)|
| 1:34:44| This is very complicated financing to do in an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5684)|
| 1:34:47| that has not been developed in many, many years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5687)|
| 1:34:50| And so that's one reason that it's gonna take a few months| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5690)|
| 1:34:56| for us to finalize these negotiations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| is to give their side an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5699)|
| 1:35:01| to be able to tell us exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5701)|
| 1:35:03| what they will be able to do right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5703)|
| 1:35:05| Randy, would you like to add anything to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5705)|
| 1:35:07| Yeah, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5707)|
| 1:35:08| So our plan is to start our construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| at the same time as the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5710)|
| 1:35:12| And my goal would be for all the retail residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5712)|
| 1:35:16| to open up at the exact same time as the stadium.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| It would be inconvenient for people going to the stadium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5718)|
| 1:35:23| to have other construction going on at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5723)|
| 1:35:26| When they're going to the game and vice versa,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5726)|
| 1:35:28| you don't wanna have apartments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5728)|
| 1:35:30| with people looking down at construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5730)|
| 1:35:31| I think on both sides, people will be tolerant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| The idea that it will actually be perfectly timed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-ws-r-3877-210204-co-com-joint-work-session?start=5733)|
