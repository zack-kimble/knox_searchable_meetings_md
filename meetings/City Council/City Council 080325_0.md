| 0:02:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=145)|
| 0:02:26| I was contacted by some folks who live out on Mill Road in the Washington Pike area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=146)|
| 0:02:32| and agreed to make a motion to postpone that for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=152)|

| 0:02:47| Vice Mayor Brown, is that a comment or another light?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=167)|
| 0:02:49| That was just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=169)|
| 0:02:50| Now it's another light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=170)|
| 0:02:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=171)|
| 0:02:52| Any other comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=172)|
| 0:02:53| All those in favor of postponing 12A and B for two weeks, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=173)|

| 0:02:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=178)|
| 0:02:59| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| I'd like to postpone for two weeks item 10A and its companion, which would be considered| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=181)|
| 0:03:06| with it, 11S.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=186)|
| 0:03:08| I do note, I imagine from looking at the folk I heard there are people on both sides of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| this issue that are here today have talked to Arthur Seymour, Jr., who represents the developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=193)|
| 0:03:20| and have talked to some of the affected neighborhoods, actually the appellant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| and they're all in agreement to this two-week reset.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=204)|
| 0:03:30| Postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=210)|
| 0:03:31| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=211)|
| 0:03:32| I went into legal mode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=212)|
| 0:03:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=214)|
| 0:03:35| I second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=215)|
| 0:03:36| I didn't hear a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=216)|
| 0:03:37| There's a motion and a second to postpone 10A and its companion for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=217)|
| 0:03:42| Would anybody representing either side like to comment real quick on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=222)|
| 0:03:48| I know a lot of folks are here, so we hate to postpone something when people come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=228)|
| 0:03:57| Arthur Seymour, Jr., 550 West Main Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=237)|
| 0:04:01| I discussed this several times with Vice Mayor Brown, I guess yesterday and maybe over the weekend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=241)|
| 0:04:08| and met with him briefly today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=248)|
| 0:04:11| And after receiving his wisdom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=251)|
| 0:04:14| I thought it would be best that we have some further discussions over the next two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=254)|
| 0:04:19| and hopefully resolve a number of the issues that are outstanding here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=259)|
| 0:04:24| And we've already set one meeting, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=266)|
| 0:04:27| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=267)|
| 0:04:28| Would anybody else like to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=268)|
| 0:04:30| Nobody has to, but okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=270)|
| 0:04:33| I mentioned the orange clad people are from the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=273)|
| 0:04:35| and I have not had a chance to discuss this with them, but will outside in just a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=275)|
| 0:04:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=279)|
| 0:04:42| The motion and second is to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=282)|
| 0:04:44| Any comments or lights for other things or this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=284)|
| 0:04:47| This.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=287)|
| 0:04:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=288)|
| 0:04:49| Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=289)|
| 0:04:50| Mayor, I know these folks came down here, and it's time-consuming, it's not easy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=290)|
| 0:04:54| and I know Mr. Seymour said the folks in orange were in support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=294)|
| 0:05:00| and I was just curious if you might ask who it was for and who it was against| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=300)|
| 0:05:03| so their trip wasn't down, their trip here wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=303)|
| 0:05:07| If you'd like to ask that question, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=307)|
| 0:05:09| For those who are for it, I'd just like to see you stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=309)|
| 0:05:14| And those who opposed it, if those could stand up after they sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=314)|
| 0:05:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| How was that, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| You did well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=326)|
| 0:05:28| I was advised that a number of people found out of this possibility from the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| and stopped before coming here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=334)|

| 0:05:56| Consent items are 11T through 11AA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=356)|
| 0:06:00| Is there a motion to approve those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=360)|

| 0:06:09| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=369)|
| 0:06:10| I've got several quick things on Mayor's report and then a special presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=370)|
| 0:06:15| I think a lot of you all know this is Community Development Week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=375)|
| 0:06:18| and our community development folks work hard to provide great low| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=378)|
| 0:06:21| and moderate income housing and other development throughout the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=381)|
| 0:06:25| All year long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=385)|
| 0:06:26| But this is a particular week when nationally those efforts are recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| Today we had a very successful groundbreaking for a new affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=391)|
| 0:06:35| visitable greenhouse out on Chestnut Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=395)|
| 0:06:38| It's a great location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=398)|
| 0:06:39| It's like I said, as Madeline Rojero said today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=399)|
| 0:06:42| it's one thing to have a mortgage be affordable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=402)|
| 0:06:44| but it really helps when the operating costs are affordable too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=404)|
| 0:06:46| and cutting the utility bills and everything which this house is doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=406)|
| 0:06:50| It is going to be designed to meet all visitability criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| It really is a great place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=413)|
| 0:06:54| It's part of seven homes that we are going to be building that meet both LEED standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=414)|
| 0:07:00| and I think they're all going to be visitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=420)|
| 0:07:01| Is that right, Madeline?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=421)|
| 0:07:03| So we're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=423)|
| 0:07:04| It's being funded with empowerment zone, blighted property redevelopment money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=424)|
| 0:07:09| and home funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=429)|
| 0:07:11| So I want to let everybody know about that if you didn't get there today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=431)|
| 0:07:14| Tomorrow there's a free,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=434)|
| 0:07:16| and I want to make this for our audience listening at home too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=436)|
| 0:07:18| small business conference at the Moses Center over on Carrick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=438)|
| 0:07:22| It's co-sponsored by HUD, SunTrust Bank, the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| and Tennessee Small Business Development Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=447)|
| 0:07:30| There will be sessions and workshops on topics related to a business plan development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| marketing, small business initiatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| It was incorrectly listed in the paper as being today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| So if you have anybody that needs to hear that message and pass it on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=461)|
| 0:07:44| it is actually tomorrow and they haven't missed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=464)|

| 0:08:51| I'm going to ask Mike Murray to come on up to the podium, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=531)|
| 0:08:55| Mike is the general president and general manager of the Ice Bears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=535)|
| 0:08:58| and we're very proud of the Ice Bears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=538)|
| 0:09:00| If you haven't been to one of their games, they're great fun to begin with, number one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=540)|
| 0:09:03| Number two, you can join about 4,000 others of your closest friends| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=543)|
| 0:09:06| who are out having a great time as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=546)|

| 0:09:21| and then we'll make a presentation from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=561)|
| 0:09:23| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=563)|
| 0:09:24| First of all, I'd like to thank you for having us here in this forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=564)|
| 0:09:27| It's tremendous to be recognized by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=567)|
| 0:09:30| Yes, we have some great players here, our head coach, our marketing director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=570)|
| 0:09:37| Throughout the year, we've experienced growth in our sport.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=577)|
| 0:09:40| Hockey is alive and well in the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=580)|
| 0:09:42| We have averaged over more than 4,000 people a night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=582)|
| 0:09:45| We have significantly accomplished as a team, as an organization,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=585)|
| 0:09:50| all the way down from the ownership group, the regular season championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=590)|
| 0:09:54| Our work is not finished at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=594)|
| 0:09:56| We start our playoffs Friday and Saturday night at 7.30 at the Knoxville Civic Coliseum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=596)|
| 0:10:01| We would like to have 4,000-plus to add to our attendance figures for this season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=601)|
| 0:10:08| And like I said, it's been overwhelming support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=608)|
| 0:10:11| We are very proud to have the name Knoxville on our jerseys when we go into these other cities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=611)|
| 0:10:16| and basically take care of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=616)|
| 0:10:19| We are expecting nothing less to winning the entire league.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=619)|
| 0:10:24| And like I said, we need the rally support from the folks in Knoxville to help us accomplish that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=624)|
| 0:10:32| If you could introduce the players who have come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| I know the coach is here and some marketing folks as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| Actually, I'm going to let our coach, Scotty Hillman, come up and introduce the players.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=637)|
| 0:10:40| We have a couple of all-stars and a couple of captains here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=640)|
| 0:10:42| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| Our coach, Scotty Hillman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| Thank you, Mike, and thank you, Mayor, for having us here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| I want to introduce these gentlemen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=652)|
| 0:10:54| First, a couple of our captains, B.J. Pelkey, Mike Cragen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=654)|
| 0:11:00| and then two award winners being recognized from their peers around the league.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=660)|
| 0:11:06| Matt Pierce, who was on the all-rookie team, and Kirk Irving, our goaltender,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=666)|
| 0:11:11| who is also a rookie but was also named to the second-team all-star lineup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=671)|
| 0:11:15| which is outstanding for a rookie goaltender.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=675)|
| 0:11:24| We also had a couple other award winners that could not be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| Kevin Swider was once again named the MVP of the league.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=688)|
| 0:11:31| He was the league's leading scorer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=691)|
| 0:11:33| And also we had a defenseman who led the league in a plus-minus category,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=693)|
| 0:11:36| which is an outstanding category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| That tells you he does a great job at both ends of the ice, Kevin Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| They're unable to be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=702)|
| 0:11:44| They apologize for not being.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=704)|
| 0:11:46| In summary, I'm probably one of Knoxville's newest residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=706)|
| 0:11:49| and my family and I are extremely happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=709)|
| 0:11:52| We face the challenge every year of recruiting individuals to come to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| and from the time Mike invited me here and bringing my wife and two young children to town,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=716)|
| 0:12:02| it's been outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| We appreciate the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| It's a beautiful city, and we've spent some time in the south| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| but no friendlier place than Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| So we thank you, and we love the support at the rink, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| The staff, Kim Bittinger and Mike and the whole staff at the Ice Bears,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=734)|
| 0:12:19| they do an incredible job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=739)|
| 0:12:20| We've been to a lot of rinks in our lifetime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=740)|
| 0:12:22| and never seen a better quality product that they put on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=742)|
| 0:12:26| and we're just a small part of it on the ice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| The majority of the work behind the scenes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| and to see that the 4,000 people jammed into that arena is outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=750)|
| 0:12:35| It's one of the best venues in minor league hockey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| So thank you again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| Mike, if you and Coach and the players can maybe congregate and grab the trophy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=759)|
| 0:12:43| we'd love to take a picture of you guys around the podium there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=763)|
| 0:12:46| Is that okay, Randy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| And if you guys will congregate there, let me remind everybody,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| playoffs are Friday night and Saturday night, 730, because they're the regular league champs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=770)|
| 0:12:54| They have home ice advantage throughout the playoffs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| And so I really want to encourage folks to go out and support them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=777)|
| 0:13:00| They're also tenants of ours in that they help us keep the Coliseum going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| so we appreciate that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| So if you guys would do that and let us have a picture, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=785)|
| 0:13:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=794)|
| 0:13:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=825)|
| 0:13:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| Let's go to the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=832)|
| 0:13:55| Guys, can we take a picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=835)|
| 0:13:56| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=836)|
| 0:13:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=837)|
| 0:14:00| I know, Mayor, some of us have seen you skate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| I know some of us have seen him fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=846)|
| 0:14:09| Why is everybody laughing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| Thank you very much, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| We appreciate you all taking time to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| Reports from members of council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=857)|
| 0:14:18| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=858)|
| 0:14:19| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=859)|
| 0:14:20| First, let me report that I had the distinct honor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| and pleasure today of attending a 50th anniversary celebration for the Medic Blood Bank,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=864)|
| 0:14:30| who has been serving our community for 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=870)|
| 0:14:33| I wanted to say on the record to them, well done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=873)|
| 0:14:35| They're the area's only provider of blood and blood products for our 29 medical centers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=875)|
| 0:14:40| and other recipients in the 21 East Tennessee counties, the only one that does that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=880)|
| 0:14:45| So I wanted to make sure it got on the record and tell them, great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=885)|
| 0:14:48| Say congratulations to them for recognizing their founder, Carl Nelson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| and thank them for including me in their festivities today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=892)|
| 0:14:57| Also, I wanted to, and this is not really an announcement, but I wanted to ask, well, you know what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=897)|
| 0:15:05| I can ask this later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=905)|
| 0:15:09| I'll ask this later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=909)|
| 0:15:10| I want to get an update about the chronic problem properties task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=910)|
| 0:15:13| and kind of where we stand with all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=913)|
| 0:15:15| And I can just get that later on if you'll just.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=917)|
| 0:15:18| We're always any time to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=918)|
| 0:15:21| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=921)|
| 0:15:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=923)|
| 0:15:24| Two things, briefly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| One, I just wanted to announce to everybody, and apparently some people don't know this, the grand opening of Cisco,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=926)|
| 0:15:34| I guess the big fish in our industrial park is happening next Tuesday at 430 at their new facility in the I-275 business park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=934)|
| 0:15:43| I think that's something we're all excited about and very much looking forward to the how many hundred people, 300 people that will be working there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=943)|
| 0:15:50| Plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=950)|
| 0:15:51| So that's one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=951)|
| 0:15:52| I also wanted to give people a heads up, April 26th is going to be the Lonsdale cleanup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=952)|
| 0:15:57| which is a chance to do good picking up litter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=957)|
| 0:16:00| And the real exciting thing is they have a community event right after that where they gather| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=960)|
| 0:16:05| and there's some good food and music.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=965)|
| 0:16:07| My understanding is it's going to be about 1 o'clock at the new Lonsdale Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=967)|
| 0:16:11| It's well worth coming to, wonderful community and a lot of energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=971)|
| 0:16:15| So I think somebody will be giving you more details on that, but I wanted to get it on your calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=975)|
| 0:16:20| April 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=980)|
| 0:16:21| April 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=982)|
| 0:16:23| Saturday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=983)|

| 0:16:25| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=985)|
| 0:16:26| I have one last announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=986)|
| 0:16:27| Any other announcement from anybody in council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=987)|
| 0:16:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=989)|
| 0:16:30| I wanted to take the chance here because it's his last council meeting to recognize one of our assistant chiefs, Don Green,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=990)|
| 0:16:37| who is going to be retiring as of the end of this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=997)|
| 0:16:41| Don has worked for the city for 28 and a half years if I've done my math right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1001)|
| 0:16:45| and has really been, I was thinking today, he's been an exemplary officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| He has been somebody that, to me, epitomizes what the professionalism means out of a police officer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1010)|
| 0:16:56| And he always came not just with problems but with solutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| And I think that's how you measure somebody's effectiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| And Don has accepted a job with the UT Law Enforcement Innovation Center to run that for UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1023)|
| 0:17:10| But we'll be helping other police agencies and law enforcement agencies around the area to raise the level of their game as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1030)|
| 0:17:20| So, Don, we're excited for you for the chance to expand your professional horizons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1040)|
| 0:17:25| but we wanted to let you know that we'll miss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1045)|
| 0:17:27| We really do appreciate the job you've done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| I know a lot of folks on council joined me in saying that your years of service have been a much better city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1049)|
| 0:17:37| and I mean that very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1057)|
| 0:17:39| So, thank you, and we will miss having you around here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1059)|
| 0:17:55| The second reason he was here was to make sure Resolution 11Z passed because that's his pension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1075)|
| 0:18:05| Don, would you like to say anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| You don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| I don't mean to put you on the spot, but if you'd like to, you're obviously welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1087)|
| 0:18:10| No, Mayor, I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1090)|
| 0:18:11| One is I would like to thank the city council and the mayor for their recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1091)|
| 0:18:17| I appreciate being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1097)|
| 0:18:18| I'm not a Knoxville-born citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1098)|
| 0:18:19| I came here to come on the police department back in 1979.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1099)|
| 0:18:24| I've enjoyed my time here, although I'm not planning on leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| I've seen the city progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1109)|
| 0:18:30| I've seen the police department progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1110)|
| 0:18:32| I've enjoyed all of the council people that I've worked with over the years, the mayors I've worked with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1112)|
| 0:18:37| and especially both the city employees, police, fire, service, throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1117)|
| 0:18:44| It's a professional organization from the line people all the way up to the command staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| and I've seen it grow and get better with each year, and I appreciate that opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1129)|
| 0:18:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| Don is like the Sun Sphere in the Tennessee Amphitheater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1133)|
| 0:18:57| He's here because the world's fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1137)|
| 0:19:00| He was part of the crew that was hired as we beefed up to handle the world's fair, and we're awfully glad we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1140)|
| 0:19:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1146)|
| 0:19:07| Mayor Haslam, I certainly cannot be as eloquent as you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| but I just would feel so remiss, chief, if I didn't say how much you have meant to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1150)|
| 0:19:18| particularly in the six years that I've been on council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1158)|
| 0:19:23| One thing that you didn't mention, Mayor Haslam, was his accessibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1163)|
| 0:19:28| and he has just been incredibly responsive and accessible, and I am so grateful for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1168)|
| 0:19:35| I'm going to miss you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1175)|
| 0:19:37| When I first learned about this retirement, I said you can't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1177)|
| 0:19:40| I've told a number of people they can't go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1180)|
| 0:19:42| They don't listen to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1182)|
| 0:19:44| But I wish you well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1184)|
| 0:19:47| I'm so happy that this position is open and you've been hired there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1187)|
| 0:19:53| and you're going to remain in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1193)|
| 0:19:56| But thank you on a personal note for everything that you've done for me and for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1196)|
| 0:20:03| We expect to see you back here frequently at city council meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1203)|
| 0:20:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1208)|
| 0:20:10| 9A is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1210)|
| 0:20:13| zoning regulations regulating the size of residential accessory buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1213)|
| 0:20:18| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1220)|
| 0:20:21| Ms. Pelo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1221)|
| 0:20:23| Mayor Haslam, I considered requesting a postponement of this ordinance before we started our meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1223)|
| 0:20:34| I have had a number of people contact me who feel that this is just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| there are just too many questions, too many concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| some tweaking I think is the word today that was used in one communication to me that is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1244)|
| 0:20:52| I see a couple of people who are with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1252)|
| 0:20:55| They have signed up to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1255)|
| 0:20:57| Have they?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1257)|
| 0:20:58| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1258)|
| 0:20:59| Because I feel we didn't postpone it two weeks ago because Councilman Becker made an appeal to go on and approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1259)|
| 0:21:09| I understand his concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| I understand full well the situation with BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1272)|
| 0:21:17| But these questions keep coming and these comments keep coming to my ears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1277)|
| 0:21:23| And I think it's important for us to look strongly at whether we want to approve this now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1283)|
| 0:21:28| or whether we want a little bit more work done on it in a couple of weeks to consider that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| Would you like to hear from them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1294)|
| 0:21:35| We have Jim Bletner and Charlotte Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| And Jim signed up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| Jim, you can go ahead and then Charlotte can come afterwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1298)|
| 0:21:41| You can give us your name and address and you have five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1301)|
| 0:21:44| Jim Bletner, 3819 Glenfield Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1304)|
| 0:21:49| I'm here speaking on behalf of the Bearden Council and also the Kings and Pikes Quarry Hills Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1309)|
| 0:21:54| We would very much like to see this postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1314)|
| 0:21:57| We think there are some inherent problems with the way that some of it's worded| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1317)|
| 0:22:01| and some of the specifications that they have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1321)|
| 0:22:05| I think that there is ground that something could be done to salvage the work that's been done by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1325)|
| 0:22:13| I think a lot of us felt that what we thought was going to come out of the efforts that BZA initiated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1333)|
| 0:22:23| it's been subverted to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1343)|
| 0:22:27| We think that with a little work, a public workshop, that it could be turned around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1347)|
| 0:22:34| We also think that, for whatever reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1354)|
| 0:22:37| that this has really slipped under the radar for a lot of neighborhood associations and neighborhood groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1357)|
| 0:22:45| It hits many and all of the different zoning areas, some of them in different ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1365)|
| 0:22:50| I think all of us agree that in many cases that the current standard that we have is insufficient in a lot of ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1370)|
| 0:22:59| However, we do have a process in place which allows us to take care of those problems that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1379)|
| 0:23:07| and that's the Variance Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1387)|
| 0:23:09| That doesn't necessarily go away while we postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1389)|
| 0:23:12| So I think to make good common sense, it would be to do it right, don't rush it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1392)|
| 0:23:18| give the neighborhoods a little more chance to look it over, to put some input in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1398)|
| 0:23:22| so that we're comfortable with it because we're the ones that ultimately will end up having the burden of dealing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1402)|
| 0:23:28| with whether it's right or whether it's wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| And for those cases that are waiting, that need to go forward, the variance process is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1411)|
| 0:23:38| I know I see several of the council members at the ABCA board on a regular basis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1418)|
| 0:23:43| normally when they have something in their area, and they often will see me there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1423)|
| 0:23:48| So I am well aware of the situations with the problems with size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1428)|
| 0:23:56| When our association looks at the requests that we get, very often we will be supportive of those requests.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1436)|
| 0:24:03| Sometimes we won't because there are particular situations where it isn't appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1443)|
| 0:24:08| and then there are many that are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1448)|
| 0:24:10| So I just believe we need a little more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1450)|
| 0:24:14| and I'd appreciate it if we would postpone with a public workshop to be had prior to the second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1454)|
| 0:24:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1461)|
| 0:24:22| Charlotte.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1462)|
| 0:24:28| I was going to ask that before you voted on this change that you take a couple of things into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1468)|
| 0:24:35| First, I wonder if all of you read the entire recommendation from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1475)|
| 0:24:48| I remember what Mr. Swanson said a couple of weeks ago, that it's generally better to have a clear, clean statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1488)|
| 0:24:56| And the language in this proposed change is certainly not a clear, clean statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1496)|
| 0:25:04| In the Fountain City area right now, we're having an ongoing situation regarding an accessory building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1504)|
| 0:25:12| And the person who built this structure said to another member of Fountain City town hall board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1512)|
| 0:25:19| that he would build his accessory building any size that he wanted to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1519)|
| 0:25:25| that there was always a way to get around things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1525)|
| 0:25:30| So if this proposed change is accepted as it's written now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1530)|
| 0:25:37| there probably will be others in the community who will make their own interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1537)|
| 0:25:44| So please consider having a more clear specification of the size of the accessory building, one that is uniform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1544)|
| 0:25:54| I doubt that many people will need a structure larger than 900 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1554)|
| 0:26:00| which is the size of a three-car garage, unless there's an ulterior motive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1560)|
| 0:26:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1567)|
| 0:26:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1568)|
| 0:26:09| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1570)|
| 0:26:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1571)|
| 0:26:12| Council, the motion is to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1572)|
| 0:26:15| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1575)|
| 0:26:16| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1576)|
| 0:26:17| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1577)|
| 0:26:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| The motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| Before a motion to postpone is made, I've gone back through the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1583)|
| 0:26:28| This started back with a letter in May of last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1588)|
| 0:26:33| I don't have a problem postponing it, but the issue that I'm bringing up now I've brought up before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1593)|
| 0:26:39| this is something that comes up with a frequency of less than once a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1599)|
| 0:26:47| BZA and now MPC, in my opinion, are able to adequately handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1607)|
| 0:26:53| I had issues before with throwing the gates a little further open and ultimately voted against what was going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1613)|
| 0:27:03| I still think that something that happens on a frequency of less than once a month is not really a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1623)|
| 0:27:12| considering the size of our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1632)|
| 0:27:15| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1635)|
| 0:27:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1636)|
| 0:27:17| Councilman Hawkless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1637)|
| 0:27:19| Well, I would tend to concur with Councilman Frost on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| I'm not sure that there's a real justification for this, but I'm certainly willing to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1642)|
| 0:27:27| What I was wondering, I think we have – I know we have a workshop on May 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1647)|
| 0:27:33| I'm trying to figure out what other workshops are scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1653)|
| 0:27:37| We had a request for a workshop, and just in terms of thinking about whether or not that's appropriate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1657)|
| 0:27:42| one of the considerations is what other workshops are scheduled over the next few weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1662)|
| 0:27:47| Does anyone know of any other workshops listed besides May 1st?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| We have lots of workshops.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| That's what I was thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1673)|
| 0:27:54| They're just not on my calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1674)|
| 0:27:55| I think we're covered until about December 15, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1675)|
| 0:27:59| We have one on April 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1679)|
| 0:28:01| April 17th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| We have one on the 3rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| I'm wondering if there's another way to whip this cat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| I've just heard from so many people about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| I was going to comment, and then I thought maybe not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1696)|
| 0:28:19| But I've had e-mails from Forest Heights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1699)|
| 0:28:22| I've had e-mails from the Lonest Drive Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| And, of course, those happen to be out my way, and that's who I tend to hear from more frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1706)|
| 0:28:33| I guess maybe I want to make one comment in regard to the BZA situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1713)|
| 0:28:40| It disturbs me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1720)|
| 0:28:42| I attend almost all BZA meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1722)|
| 0:28:44| It seems that there's always something from out my way that needs to be discussed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1724)|
| 0:28:51| It disturbs me terribly to see the BZA feel that they must just throw up their hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1731)|
| 0:29:00| or pass on making a real decision and say, oh, we'll just pass it along to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1740)|
| 0:29:08| I think that's a big concern that Councilman Becker has as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1748)|
| 0:29:13| We both happen to spend a lot of time at BZA meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1753)|
| 0:29:18| and we both tend to get very frustrated when they don't feel they have the tools they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1758)|
| 0:29:24| Is that how you would characterize that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1764)|
| 0:29:27| To take care of matters that are really for them to handle and that should not have to come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1767)|
| 0:29:36| And, frankly, I think what the neighborhoods who are saying, wait, wait, wait,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| let's be sure that we have a clear-cut ordinance before we pass it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1781)|
| 0:29:49| they are wanting those things to be clarified so that those decisions can be made at the BZA level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1789)|
| 0:29:56| and not have to be appealed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1796)|
| 0:29:59| And, I mean, that's what I'm feeling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1799)|
| 0:30:03| I agree with Councilman Becker that the sooner the better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| I mean, we both wanted this resolved months ago because of our frustrations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1808)|
| 0:30:13| However, over the last two weeks, I have really felt that we need to hold up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1813)|
| 0:30:22| but I don't want to hold up until May, Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| That troubles me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1826)|
| 0:30:28| So I don't know how we resolve that because I think one more BZA meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| and one more BZA meeting just means more issues to come here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1832)|
| 0:30:36| It's the time of year where these accessory building issues tend to come up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1836)|
| 0:30:41| because it's a good time to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1841)|
| 0:30:43| And that's all I will say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| And I'm not a big one to postpone things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1846)|
| 0:30:48| but I don't want us to make a mistake that will not resolve this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1848)|
| 0:30:54| that continues to be a problem for these neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1854)|
| 0:30:58| Councilman Ronnie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1858)|
| 0:31:00| I don't attend BZA meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| so I'm trying to figure out if this is something that's truly broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1862)|
| 0:31:05| I mean, I hear Councilman Frost saying that maybe, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1865)|
| 0:31:08| if it ain't broke, don't fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1868)|
| 0:31:10| And that seems to be kind of what we're hearing from some of the neighborhood associations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1870)|
| 0:31:13| and yet I think I'm understanding from Councilman Pilo and Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1873)|
| 0:31:18| that they do think that we need to fix.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1878)|
| 0:31:20| So talk to me a little bit about, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| is it something that we just want to throw out and stick with what we have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1882)|
| 0:31:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1888)|
| 0:31:30| Well, I think it is broke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| I think what Rob would talk about is how badly broke it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1892)|
| 0:31:35| or how often it being broke makes a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1895)|
| 0:31:38| I think it's a – I'd say it's a badly broken system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1898)|
| 0:31:41| because we're sending people to the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| where you have to have a hardship to get a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1904)|
| 0:31:48| And what their hardship is is their property is larger, you know, shaped differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1908)|
| 0:31:53| but larger would be the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| So it's a system that doesn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1915)|
| 0:31:58| And I understand Ms. Pilo's challenge with how we make this happen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1918)|
| 0:32:03| because I think we do a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1923)|
| 0:32:05| I think the added thing is if we do a workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| and we as council decide we want something different than what MPC considered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| it has to go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1933)|
| 0:32:15| I think that it does make sense for this council to make that decision, Ms. Roddy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1935)|
| 0:32:18| to dig into it to find out what's broken and how to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1938)|
| 0:32:21| I think sometimes we get a little too easily saying, well, something's a problem here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1941)|
| 0:32:26| Let's have MPC deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1946)|
| 0:32:27| I think we should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1947)|
| 0:32:29| I think the one option would be to postpone it, see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1949)|
| 0:32:33| The other would be to adopt this and then go back and fix it later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1953)|
| 0:32:37| I mean, I tend to think that this is about 95% correct,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1957)|
| 0:32:42| and one option would be to fix the remaining 5% down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1962)|
| 0:32:46| which would change the system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1966)|
| 0:32:47| We could argue about some of the specifics, one, some of the size stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1967)|
| 0:32:52| The other, there's an interesting level right now with an accessory building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1972)|
| 0:32:56| If you attach it to your house, it doesn't come under this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| We have some interesting ones that Ms. Davis knows about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| where people have been going around about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1983)|
| 0:33:05| and then they just built a fence and all of a sudden they could build whatever they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1985)|
| 0:33:08| So I think there's some very deep areas where this is a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1988)|
| 0:33:13| and I don't have a problem with a postponement or a passing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1993)|
| 0:33:16| and let's do a workshop to fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=1996)|
| 0:33:20| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2000)|
| 0:33:21| Councilman Bailey, and then I'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2001)|
| 0:33:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2002)|
| 0:33:23| I just really echo what has just been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| and I don't see a problem with a postponement, delaying it, discussing it, and talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| And I've had a number of neighborhood leaders call me, encouraging me to postpone it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| so that we could have a healthy discussion in a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| So I'll be supporting a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2021)|
| 0:33:44| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2024)|
| 0:33:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2025)|
| 0:33:46| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2026)|
| 0:33:47| First, to respond to Councilman Becker's idea of 95 percent right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| Don't get me wrong, but if you're living next to the 5 percent, that's not a good situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2031)|
| 0:33:57| I want to bring up what has been not debated tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| but has been debated in the past on this very topic and what Ms. Davis referred to earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2040)|
| 0:34:06| Was that it seemed, and Mr. Blutner, you can come forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| This is a question that's coming to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2050)|
| 0:34:12| that, you know, we increase the size from 750 square feet to 900 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2052)|
| 0:34:19| I don't see the whole system to be as totally broken as Bob does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| You know, some tweaking might be necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2065)|
| 0:34:28| And I'm, you know, just wondering how folks on Council and Mr. Blutner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2068)|
| 0:34:33| since he's here for two different organizations getting two paychecks tonight, no doubt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2073)|
| 0:34:39| feels about, you know, the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2079)|
| 0:34:42| I mean, Ms. Davis referenced the 900 square foot issue that was debated previously| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2082)|
| 0:34:49| when this has been at City Council and it was taken up previously by MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| Go ahead, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2095)|
| 0:34:56| I would more tend to agree with your assessment that it's not totally broken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2096)|
| 0:35:03| I think what we've got is we've got a BZA board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| that now feels like they want to go by what the zoning code says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2105)|
| 0:35:09| and that's that, you know, you've got to have legitimate reason to ask for the hardship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2109)|
| 0:35:13| In the past, that hasn't been the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2113)|
| 0:35:16| So I also agree with what you said about the 95%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2116)|
| 0:35:21| You know, that 5%, what sneaks through on that 5% can really be a problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2121)|
| 0:35:25| and I'll give you a perfect example of what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2125)|
| 0:35:28| We don't have any height restrictions in this as it now stands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2128)|
| 0:35:32| It's basically in concert with the existing house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| Well, we also have a five-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| So I can tell you that often when we have complaints from our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| it's when somebody's building a garage that wants a variance for the height| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2143)|
| 0:35:50| so they can put a second story above it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2150)|
| 0:35:52| and people don't want somebody on that second story looking over their privacy fence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2152)|
| 0:35:58| into their swimming pool or their backyard, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2158)|
| 0:36:00| and that's one of the legitimate things that can be a real problem,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2160)|
| 0:36:04| and it isn't addressed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2164)|
| 0:36:08| And I think, you know, maybe there could be a way that a lot of these issues could be addressed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2168)|
| 0:36:17| How do you feel about the 900 square foot?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2177)|
| 0:36:20| The 900 square foot was where I thought we were going to be generally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2180)|
| 0:36:25| But, again, just being, you know, playing devil's advocate here, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| if I've got a 1,500 square foot lot, that's a reasonable, maybe it's reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2189)|
| 0:36:36| but what's the floor plan of that house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| I mean, am I three stories high or two stories high, or am I all on one story?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2199)|
| 0:36:44| What's the footprint?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| And I know we have the 30% lot coverage that's in there, which should alleviate that issue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2205)|
| 0:36:53| but I will tell you from past experience that if there's one thing that is missed at MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| in plans review, it's 30% lot coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2218)|
| 0:37:01| I think Ms. Roddy has some personal experience with that in the situation that was won in Sequoia Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2221)|
| 0:37:08| where there was an addition put on, and it wasn't the they accepted it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2228)|
| 0:37:14| but in reality there was never a complete site plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| So there was no way to test the lot coverage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| But, yeah, I mean, there was going to be a garage where it was really very questionable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2242)|
| 0:37:28| but the lot coverage was never looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2248)|
| 0:37:31| So, consequently, when we raised that issue, we ended up having a situation where they had to reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2251)|
| 0:37:37| what they were trying to do to a small degree, but it wasn't looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2257)|
| 0:37:43| And so if we're relying totally on the 30% lot coverage, I think there are some inherent problems there, too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2263)|
| 0:37:50| unless we require a site plan when they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2270)|
| 0:37:55| Ms. Peeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2275)|
| 0:37:57| Let me remember what I was going to say now and respond to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| Well, you know, maybe not totally broken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2281)|
| 0:38:04| but it wouldn't be broken if the BCA was comfortable with the role that it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| It is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2289)|
| 0:38:11| And that's where I'm very frustrated because we go, we spend a lot of time there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| and then it's simply to move back over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| Now, a question that I have, just a comment I want to make.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2300)|
| 0:38:25| I really would not like to see this have to go back through the BCA process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| and that's a troubling thing to me simply because of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2310)|
| 0:38:34| I think that's why Councilman Becker is so opposed to postponing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2314)|
| 0:38:39| So, Mr. Swanson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2319)|
| 0:38:44| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2324)|
| 0:38:45| To what degree, I think we talked about this briefly two weeks ago, to what degree can we amend this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2325)|
| 0:38:51| You can amend it to the degree to which it has been already considered by the Metropolitan Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2331)|
| 0:38:57| If the proposed amendment is something that does not appear on the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| was reviewed by the Metropolitan Planning Commission, whether or not they adopted that proposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2341)|
| 0:39:07| if it was reviewed by the Metropolitan Planning Commission, you can amend it to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| If it's something that was not presented and is not in the record as being before MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| it will have to go back to MPC for further consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2357)|
| 0:39:24| I think Mr. Blattner wants to comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| Would that be all right, Ms. Roddy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2367)|
| 0:39:28| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2368)|
| 0:39:29| Yes, I was going to ask the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2369)|
| 0:39:30| Go ahead, Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| Look at the timing that you're talking about as far as what's concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2372)|
| 0:39:36| First of all, BZA meets the third Thursday of each month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2376)|
| 0:39:43| And then you have a 15-day window to appeal, I believe is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2383)|
| 0:39:46| Is it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2386)|
| 0:39:48| Fifteen-day window to appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2388)|
| 0:39:50| And then it's got to get on the calendar to be heard by city council and has to be advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2390)|
| 0:39:56| So, in essence, the amount of time that you're talking about, if something goes before BZA coming up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2396)|
| 0:40:04| is really more than a month before there's going to be any appeal that's going to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2404)|
| 0:40:11| If we're talking about the meeting in April, you're probably looking at two months or longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2411)|
| 0:40:16| So I think there is adequate time to postpone this and get something done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| which would have very little effect on the current situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2421)|
| 0:40:28| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| To Mr. Swanson's answer about to what extent we could amend this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2430)|
| 0:40:35| I thought I heard Mr. Blattner say that he had concerns that height was not addressed in this ordinance as it's written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2435)|
| 0:40:41| And I would venture to guess that MPC did not consider height in their previous discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2441)|
| 0:40:47| which if we want to include height, that immediately punts it back because we can't amend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2447)|
| 0:40:52| I mean, even if we get to a workshop, Mr. Swanson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2452)|
| 0:40:54| and we look at this and decide that we want height to be part of the formula,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2454)|
| 0:40:58| then that immediately punts it back unless height was considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2458)|
| 0:41:01| Unless height was considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2461)|
| 0:41:02| And I have not reviewed the record to see if height was considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| Mr. Donaldson, would you be able to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2465)|
| 0:41:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| Height exists in the current code and has not been recommended to be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2470)|
| 0:41:15| So height, the current height requirement still exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2475)|
| 0:41:21| I guess the issue, did they consider any changes or any revisions to any height requirements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2481)|
| 0:41:28| They did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| It remains at 15 feet for all accessory buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2489)|
| 0:41:33| So in my view, if there is a proposal as to some inclusion of height requirements in this particular provision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2493)|
| 0:41:39| as opposed to simply relying on what already exists,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2499)|
| 0:41:42| then probably that would have to go back to MPC because that's a substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2502)|
| 0:41:46| To amend that, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| I'd like to recognize Mr. Blattner again and ask him if he, in his experience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2508)|
| 0:41:54| would you like to see height be referenced in this section of the code as well as what's already existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2514)|
| 0:42:01| I mean, I think I sense that you've had issues with height.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2521)|
| 0:42:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2526)|
| 0:42:07| I might disagree with Mr. Donaldson a little bit because I believe that it does reference height in here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2527)|
| 0:42:18| or it does not specifically change the statute that's there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2538)|
| 0:42:22| I believe that it does reference it, and I'm looking for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2542)|
| 0:42:25| I haven't found it yet, but as I read through it, that was certainly one of the notes that I made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| I didn't know where it was, but it talked about height compatible with the primary structure, I believe, Mark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2550)|
| 0:42:38| was what it did say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2558)|
| 0:42:39| So I think it did reference height, and I do think that's a change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| It's one of the criteria that's listed for use on review, but the requirement remains the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2562)|
| 0:42:48| H11, 10 and 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2568)|
| 0:43:02| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2582)|
| 0:43:03| Yeah, I think if we want to look at this afresh, which I think it makes sense to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| and I'm hearing a real sense through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| I don't think there's any way that we should not constrain ourselves by saying we should only consider what MPC talked about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2589)|
| 0:43:15| I think that just leaves us in an absurd discussion of, well, what we want to do is this, but MPC talked about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2595)|
| 0:43:22| so we'll go with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| I think realistically what we're doing is saying, and I will support a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2603)|
| 0:43:29| I think there is enough concern, and while it's broken, we've lasted years this way, Ms. Pelow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2609)|
| 0:43:35| and we can get through several more months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| but realistically this is going to be a workshop that we're going to have May, June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| with a recommendation then that we'll go back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| We'll come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2626)|
| 0:43:47| I'm betting it's August until this gets done, if it moves quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| I think the sense of this council is that we want to do it right, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| and the idea of let's pass this and then fix it later, that obviously didn't fly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2636)|
| 0:44:01| I thought Mr. Frost might have had a heart attack when I said that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2641)|
| 0:44:03| That was not helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| We're going to fix it, and I think we should fix it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| So, you know, I will, if somebody is going to make a motion to postpone, I'll support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2649)|
| 0:44:14| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2655)|
| 0:44:16| I just want to make sure as we're talking about workshops, so if this does get postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2656)|
| 0:44:21| just to make sure the record reflects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2661)|
| 0:44:23| council is asking council staff to find the nearest most available, I guess, workshop date to put this on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2663)|
| 0:44:29| I want to make sure that I hear that this doesn't sit there waiting on someone to pull the trigger on us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2669)|
| 0:44:35| trying to schedule this, because I want it to sit there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2675)|
| 0:44:38| Is that part of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2678)|
| 0:44:39| If someone makes the motion, make it clear if that's a part of the motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2679)|
| 0:44:43| so staff will know to go ahead and start tomorrow working on that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2683)|
| 0:44:47| And the other thing is, I guess for the record, and Mr. Donaldson, if you'll please just stay for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2687)|
| 0:44:53| does this amendment in any way or how does this amendment affect the ability of a person| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2693)|
| 0:45:00| who doesn't agree with the BZA decision to appeal this to council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2700)|
| 0:45:07| This is an MPC process with use on review, and all MPC decisions are appealable to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2707)|
| 0:45:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2714)|
| 0:45:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2715)|
| 0:45:16| I just want to hear it for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2716)|
| 0:45:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2717)|
| 0:45:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| Ms. Pillow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2719)|
| 0:45:20| That being the case, I make the motion that item number 9A be postponed until a workshop can be held.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2720)|
| 0:45:37| The closest date possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| Say it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| Well, I don't know how to say that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| Probably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2746)|
| 0:45:47| We have typically disallowed motions that were for indefinite postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2747)|
| 0:45:53| So I would recommend to you that you set it for four weeks or six weeks or something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2753)|
| 0:45:59| and then if we don't have the workshop, we just need to postpone it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| I make a motion that we postpone this for four weeks and that the council staff begin tomorrow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2763)|
| 0:46:11| to find the nearest possible workshop date to consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2771)|
| 0:46:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2776)|
| 0:46:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2777)|
| 0:46:18| Moved and seconded to postpone for four weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2778)|
| 0:46:21| Are there comments or questions on that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2781)|
| 0:46:25| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2785)|
| 0:46:27| All those in favor of postponing for four weeks, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2789)|
| 0:46:30| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| Now we can get to the second item on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| Yeah, right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| At this pace, we're going to be here until 115 in the morning, for instance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2796)|
| 0:46:41| 9B is an ordinance to amend the Knoxville City Code Appendix B Zoning Regulations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2801)|
| 0:46:45| Article IV, Section 25IH1 Infill Housing Overlay District to clarify that the Infill Housing Design Review Committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2805)|
| 0:46:52| has the authority to approve lot sizes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2812)|
| 0:46:55| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2816)|
| 0:46:57| Questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| I have a question, Mr. Donaldson, for the record with regards to appealability of any decisions in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2819)|
| 0:47:06| Decisions of the Infill Housing Design Review Committee are appealable first to the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2826)|
| 0:47:11| and then the decision of the Planning Commission could be appealed to City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2831)|
| 0:47:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=2836)|

| 0:54:19| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3259)|
| 0:54:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| I had a brief conversation with Mr. King about this earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| I certainly support this road project, but there's some of the costs in here that really concern me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3263)|
| 0:54:31| It's towards the back of the item, and it's listed page four of five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3271)|
| 0:54:37| I'm sure other folks on Council picked that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3277)|
| 0:54:41| Thompson Engineering, on their letterhead, shows that they have a local office, yet they're billing $1,750 a month for a field office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3281)|
| 0:54:52| They're billing $110 for cable Internet service, $300 for office supplies, $325 a month for a copy release,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3292)|
| 0:55:03| $300 a month for radio communications, billing on a daily basis of $25 for a full-size pickup truck, $19 for a compact pickup truck,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3303)|
| 0:55:16| and mileage driving back and forth between here and Chattanooga, despite having a Knoxville office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3316)|
| 0:55:25| I have issues with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| Mr. King certainly has an explanation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3329)|
| 0:55:31| I'm sure he'll share it with us now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3331)|
| 0:55:35| About $200-something thousand dollars worth of expenses that when you have an office here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3335)|
| 0:55:42| and taxpayers are getting charged $1,750 a month for an office and paying for somebody's cable and Internet service| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3342)|
| 0:55:51| when they already have an office and all these other expenses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3351)|
| 0:55:56| particularly when we're paying a daily fee for a pickup truck| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3356)|
| 0:55:59| and we're also being asked to pay for the mileage for those same vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3359)|
| 0:56:06| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| Well, let me start by explaining sort of how we end up with this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3368)|
| 0:56:14| This is a project that has been funded through TDOT, through the Surface Transportation Act process with gasoline tax money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3374)|
| 0:56:25| TDOT has undergone a change in the way they build these kind of projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| This project, we're kind of in transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3391)|
| 0:56:33| TDOT actually bid the construction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| so the contract for the construction will be between TDOT and the contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3396)|
| 0:56:43| But TDOT asked the city of Knoxville to handle the construction engineering inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3403)|
| 0:56:49| So we had to go do an RFQ and select a consultant to do the CEI work to meet TDOT standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3409)|
| 0:57:02| And a part of that is the way that we make payment to the consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3422)|
| 0:57:09| In this particular case, Thompson has an office in Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3429)|
| 0:57:14| They have a field office in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| They currently have a contract with TDOT to do the CEI work for the I-275 work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3436)|
| 0:57:26| We will share that overhead with TDOT while the projects are going on at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3446)|
| 0:57:34| And then later on after the 275 work is done, the overhead for that field office will be borne by this particular project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3454)|
| 0:57:44| unless they get other work, then that work will be shared also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| As far as the reimbursement for vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| that's spelled out in TDOT policies about what payment can be made for certain sizes of trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3472)|
| 0:58:00| And I think, Councilman Frost, I wasn't clear when we talked earlier today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3480)|
| 0:58:06| They do not get paid the $19 or $25 per day plus mileage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3486)|
| 0:58:11| The mileage is for when a sub-consultant or one of their project managers needs to travel from outside of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3491)|
| 0:58:23| Mr. Trabatti.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3503)|
| 0:58:24| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| I might have missed this, but is Thompson Engineering, I mean, in the process, the RFQ, did they, was there a scoring on local?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3506)|
| 0:58:36| Yes, there was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3516)|
| 0:58:38| Are they local?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3518)|
| 0:58:39| I mean, because the reason I ask this, we've been through this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3519)|
| 0:58:42| and I don't know if anyone from procurement is here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3522)|
| 0:58:45| but we've seen where people obviously list themselves as being local because that's an advantage to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3525)|
| 0:58:51| and, in fact, they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3531)|
| 0:58:54| There was a procurement process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3534)|
| 0:58:57| Actually, our purchasing agent sat on the panel with us, and we rated several firms based on their submission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3537)|
| 0:59:06| We understood at the time that Thompson's home office is in Chattanooga,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3546)|
| 0:59:15| and they were and have been in Knoxville at this temporary office as they acquired additional work for TDOT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3555)|
| 0:59:24| Where's the temporary office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3564)|
| 0:59:25| It's on High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3565)|
| 0:59:27| Their paperwork, which everybody has here, I've been flipping through it, as Joe mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3567)|
| 0:59:32| and it lists their office as 1012 High School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3572)|
| 0:59:36| I've yet to see something indicating a Chattanooga address other than I did see on their letterhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3576)|
| 0:59:42| They list both Chattanooga and Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3582)|
| 0:59:46| Well, I talked to Mr. King today, too, about this because that seems to be a pretty good business to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3586)|
| 0:59:52| That's a lot of money, and it seems like TDOT's put, with the change in rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3592)|
| 1:00:00| put us in a tough situation here with the technical aspects of the consultancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3600)|
| 1:00:06| And I'm wondering, you know, if there was a delay in this, how would that affect the project itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3606)|
| 1:00:18| Well, they are actually paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3618)|
| 1:00:22| They make an estimate based on the construction plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| and their inspectors are paid by the hour, and they bill us monthly, and we will review that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3627)|
| 1:00:36| I'm just wondering, because I didn't have a chance, once I got into some of this stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3636)|
| 1:00:40| to really look into why this is so much money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3640)|
| 1:00:45| and I hadn't had a chance really to look into it or the procurement process and the bidding process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3645)|
| 1:00:51| And I'm a little, I won't say suspect, but, you know, how some of these bids come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3651)|
| 1:00:59| and how they take full advantage of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3659)|
| 1:01:02| And when they put in there they're local and they're not, that defeats the purpose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3662)|
| 1:01:08| And I just wanted to look into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3668)|
| 1:01:10| But I'll hear what other council members have to say, and I may come back with more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3670)|
| 1:01:16| Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3676)|
| 1:01:17| I guess, Steve, the postponement, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3677)|
| 1:01:23| Postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3683)|
| 1:01:24| I mean, it's interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| I had not noticed that, and I'm glad Mr. Frost caught it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3685)|
| 1:01:27| And I think there are two sides to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3687)|
| 1:01:29| But does a postponement ruin things for us, or does it just put it back two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3689)|
| 1:01:34| Well, actually TDOT has received the bids and awarded the contract to Blalock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3694)|
| 1:01:40| and they are prepared to begin to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3700)|
| 1:01:44| A pre-construction meeting has been scheduled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3704)|
| 1:01:47| I don't have the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3707)|
| 1:01:49| Jeff Sykes is also here with Thompson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3709)|
| 1:01:52| He may be able to address if you have specific questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3712)|
| 1:01:55| Jeff, Mr. Sykes, if you want to come give us your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| and then maybe you can respond to some of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| My name is Jeff Sykes, 1838 Clearbrook Court, Chattanooga, Tennessee, 37421.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3720)|
| 1:02:07| I serve as a regional director for Thompson Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3727)|
| 1:02:09| A lot of the questions that are coming up are the project has federal funding in it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3729)|
| 1:02:15| and is part of a local roads program being administered through the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3735)|
| 1:02:20| What you're seeing is primarily a cost-plus scenario,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3740)|
| 1:02:25| and these are rules that are set forth by the federal government as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3745)|
| 1:02:31| And, basically, what you'll see is that the cost of the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3751)|
| 1:02:34| the cost of the Internet service, it's not TV service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| but all of those costs are either going to be paid for in an hourly rate per person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3758)|
| 1:02:44| like all engineering firms, or they're going to be paid for and dissected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3764)|
| 1:02:48| And the way that the state and the federal government requires us to do it is to break out those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3768)|
| 1:02:55| What you'll also see on there is a 104% overhead rate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3775)|
| 1:03:00| which you take a person's hourly rate and you multiply it times 1.04,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3780)|
| 1:03:05| and that's how you actually come up with an actual cost plus, whereas other firms are 160%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3785)|
| 1:03:11| So, in reality, when you add the numbers up, our costs are actually lower than most other firms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3791)|
| 1:03:17| because we operate in an efficient manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3797)|
| 1:03:20| To address the local issue, all of the employees in Knoxville, there's approximately ten of them, live in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3800)|
| 1:03:26| Their salaries are being applied towards schools in Knoxville, towards their house in Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3806)|
| 1:03:32| and all the services in Knoxville that they utilize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3812)|
| 1:03:39| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| Mr. Becker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| Yeah, two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| I guess at some point it does sound, Mr. King, like a delay is a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3822)|
| 1:03:46| So, maybe that's not a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3826)|
| 1:03:48| I guess just two thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3828)|
| 1:03:49| One is it sounds like some better discussion of what we mean by local hiring, local contracts, might be worthwhile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3829)|
| 1:03:56| and I've been a big proponent of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| It actually, as some of you might remember, it was part of the living wage proposal that we submitted years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3837)|
| 1:04:03| to include some provisions on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3843)|
| 1:04:05| So, I definitely support that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3845)|
| 1:04:07| I guess, Mr. King, one of the things, my understanding of this contract, it was a RFQ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3847)|
| 1:04:12| So, you didn't get, you analyzed the firm you wanted to hire, and then you negotiated the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3852)|
| 1:04:19| And on the last page, I think we have the sheet from the evaluation summary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3859)|
| 1:04:25| and all four of the evaluators rated Thompson the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3865)|
| 1:04:29| I mean, in almost every case, they were significantly higher than any other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| So, this was definitely a firm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3873)|
| 1:04:35| This was not a, we think this one's a shade better than somebody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3875)|
| 1:04:38| This was clearly the firm that we wanted to do this work from the qualifications and the people they had involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3878)|
| 1:04:44| So, I can support this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3884)|
| 1:04:47| I'd support a postponement if it wasn't a problem, but it sounds like it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3887)|
| 1:04:53| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3893)|
| 1:04:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3894)|
| 1:04:55| Mr. Sykes, I have a question for you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3895)|
| 1:04:56| If you got all these folks local, why are you wanting mileage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3896)|
| 1:05:01| Well, I'm out of Chattanooga.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| I'll serve as the principal in charge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3903)|
| 1:05:07| Primarily, the TDOT reimburses $25 a day for a full-size vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3907)|
| 1:05:11| We all know that $25 a day is not going to pay for the fuel to get from Chattanooga to Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3911)|
| 1:05:16| much less the cost of the vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3916)|
| 1:05:18| The cost plus system is to basically ensure that the consultant, whoever it may be, does not lose money on the deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3918)|
| 1:05:27| You know, these figures that are in here are actual costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3927)|
| 1:05:30| And something else that we need to consider is, you know, you're looking at a $1.7 million contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3930)|
| 1:05:36| In reality, if we are able to accomplish the project for less man hours,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3936)|
| 1:05:44| then you only pay for the actual cost of our service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3944)|
| 1:05:48| If we work less man hours, if we utilize fewer vehicles, if we are able to share the cost of the office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3948)|
| 1:05:55| share the cost of the printer and everything else, the $1.7 million is a contract ceiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3955)|
| 1:06:00| In reality, you know, it will probably come in a lot less than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3960)|
| 1:06:03| But because TDOT has safeguards in place, or they do not have safeguards in place for the consultant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3963)|
| 1:06:10| if we undershoot the estimate, then we'll strictly lose off the profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3970)|
| 1:06:14| We'll never be able to regain that profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3974)|
| 1:06:17| That is a contract ceiling, and it is through the Knoxville Engineering Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3977)|
| 1:06:22| They will approve the folks that will be out on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| If we increase staff or decrease staff, it will be through the approval of the Knoxville Engineering Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3984)|
| 1:06:30| They'll monitor the money from day one all the way through the contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3990)|
| 1:06:34| Perhaps I'm having a tough time understanding here, but you all already have a field office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3994)|
| 1:06:39| We do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=3999)|
| 1:06:40| And it's got cable internet service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4002)|
| 1:06:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| And you've got all these office supplies, and you've got a copier lease with maintenance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| and you've got the radios to use, and you've got the pickup trucks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| You have all that other equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4012)|
| 1:06:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4014)|
| 1:06:55| But, I mean, on other projects, I mean, is this, for example, the field office monthly cost is $1,750,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4015)|
| 1:07:04| and this is for over 21 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4024)|
| 1:07:07| Is that prorated for this project, or is that the entire cost for that field office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4027)|
| 1:07:12| It's a monthly fee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4032)|
| 1:07:14| Now, there are potentials, if we're able to share the office to do another TDOT project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4034)|
| 1:07:19| then what we'll do is we'll look at what personnel are operating out of that office on the Pleasant Ridge Road job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4039)|
| 1:07:25| and then which ones are operating on the other job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4045)|
| 1:07:27| and then we'll prorate that lease to build TDOT and to build the city of Chattanooga based on the usage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4047)|
| 1:07:35| and also with the copier leases, everything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| You're billing the city of Chattanooga for use of a Knoxville office?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4059)|
| 1:07:42| I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| The state of Tennessee, if we do another project in Knoxville, we'll bill the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4063)|
| 1:07:49| On a prorated basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4069)|
| 1:07:50| And this is just space in an office building you all are renting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4070)|
| 1:07:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4074)|
| 1:07:55| I mean, wouldn't you be incurring these expenses anyway, even if you didn't have this contract?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4075)|
| 1:08:05| We would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4085)|
| 1:08:07| Here's the key is we can wipe away every single one of those fees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4087)|
| 1:08:11| I mean, but what happens is your overhead rate, your percent overhead rate goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4091)|
| 1:08:16| So, irregardless, I mean, it is a cost-plus contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4096)|
| 1:08:20| We've got to justify it, have paperwork in the end to show what the actual costs were.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4100)|
| 1:08:24| But if we lose money on the deal because we're not able to pay for the offices or for the equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4104)|
| 1:08:31| then, you know, simply the overhead rate goes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4111)|
| 1:08:33| But, I mean, in reality, the money still stays the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4113)|
| 1:08:37| I mean, like I previously said, I don't take issue with the road project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4117)|
| 1:08:41| and the process that it's got to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4121)|
| 1:08:43| But, you know, I mean, don't you all own your own radio systems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4123)|
| 1:08:49| No, we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4129)|
| 1:08:50| Well, no, we leased radio systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4130)|
| 1:08:54| That's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| Well, it's just simply a cost-plus deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4135)|
| 1:08:58| It is the actual cost that we incur plus a fixed profit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4138)|
| 1:09:03| And that's the intent of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4143)|
| 1:09:05| And that's what we're showing there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4145)|
| 1:09:06| I mean, I'm just having difficulty in seeing, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4146)|
| 1:09:10| what I would consider to be overhead and things that would be naturally occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4150)|
| 1:09:16| in the ordinary operation of this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4156)|
| 1:09:20| I mean, it's almost $10,800 a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4160)|
| 1:09:23| And spread over 21 months, it's $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4163)|
| 1:09:30| So I've got real concerns about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4170)|
| 1:09:33| If I may address it one more time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4173)|
| 1:09:36| the 104% overhead rate is reflective of basically being able to charge those direct expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4176)|
| 1:09:44| If we did not charge those, just like any other engineering firm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4184)|
| 1:09:47| those costs would be rolled into the hourly cost of the personnel or in that overhead rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4187)|
| 1:09:52| So, you know, if we eliminated all those costs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| that 104% overhead rate would go up to, say, 110% just to cover those costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4194)|
| 1:10:00| What we're doing is charging basically no overhead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4200)|
| 1:10:04| 104% is only really 4% over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4204)|
| 1:10:07| And then getting directly reimbursed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4207)|
| 1:10:10| And all we did was mirror TDOT's contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4210)|
| 1:10:15| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4215)|

| 1:15:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4534)|
| 1:15:35| Need to add a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4535)|
| 1:15:36| Based on what happened last night at County Commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4536)|
| 1:15:39| It's a good, I think, a good move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4539)|

| 1:16:32| Carol Evans, 3505 Kesterwood Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4592)|
| 1:16:34| I'm Executive Director of Legacy Parks Foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4594)|
| 1:16:37| Marilyn sits on our board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4597)|
| 1:16:39| On behalf of the board, I just wanted to come and urge you to establish this task force,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4599)|
| 1:16:43| or thank you in advance for doing so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4603)|
| 1:16:45| The Legacy Parks Foundation back in June actually established this as one of our five areas of focus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4605)|
| 1:16:50| protecting our ridges and views.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4610)|
| 1:16:52| We feel that we're really blessed in this area with the gift of geography.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| Our ridges truly define our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| We are nestled amidst a whole system of ridges that are really the envy of many communities across the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| And we believe the ridges hold really strong environmental, recreational, and economic value for our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4624)|
| 1:17:09| And this is absolutely a critical time to take a look at thoughtful guidelines to manage the use and protection of our ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4629)|
| 1:17:16| So on behalf of the Legacy Parks Foundation board, I want to thank you in advance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4636)|
| 1:17:20| and urge you to establish this task force to take a thoughtful study of this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4640)|
| 1:17:24| Thanks, Carol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4644)|
| 1:17:25| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4645)|
| 1:17:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4646)|
| 1:17:27| We have another speaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4650)|
| 1:17:31| Thank you, Joe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4651)|
| 1:17:32| I'm Nan Scott, 315 Oak Park Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4652)|
| 1:17:35| And I'm representing the Knoxville League of Women Voters as their president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4655)|
| 1:17:40| And I have a prepared statement in support of the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| A committee of the league has been studying land use planning in Knoxville and Knox County for two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4664)|
| 1:17:50| In that course of study, the committee has presented three programs by community activists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4670)|
| 1:17:55| and planning experts on several aspects of land use planning to the full membership of the league.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4675)|
| 1:18:01| Numerous articles on the subject have been distributed throughout the local area through the league's monthly newsletter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4681)|
| 1:18:08| and there has been much discussion of land use planning issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4688)|
| 1:18:12| The purpose of this background work is to let you know that when the league membership adopts a position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4692)|
| 1:18:19| in support of a public policy issue, it is an informed support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4699)|
| 1:18:24| At its annual meeting last May, the Knoxville and Knox County League of Women Voters adopted a position to support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4704)|
| 1:18:30| and I quote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4710)|
| 1:18:32| policies that place restrictions on development of ridges, slopes, open spaces, and vegetation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4712)|
| 1:18:39| that have been identified as critical to maintaining our community's air and water quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4719)|
| 1:18:45| biodiversity, functioning habitats, and or historic scenic character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4725)|
| 1:18:50| We feel that the resolution before you is a good first step toward creating the kind of regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4730)|
| 1:18:56| which are appropriate and effective in restricting development of ridges and steep slopes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4736)|
| 1:19:01| The task force, which is named in your resolution, provides a good mix of community interest in the issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4741)|
| 1:19:07| The task force will be able to address the league's interest and the community's interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4747)|
| 1:19:12| in restricting development on ridges and steep slopes in order to protect water quality,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4752)|
| 1:19:18| preserve important vegetation and open space, create livable home sites,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4758)|
| 1:19:23| and preserve the scenic beauty of Knoxville and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| On behalf of the League of Women Voters, I urge your adoption of this resolution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4768)|
| 1:19:32| and thank you very much for your attention and for your commitment to improving the quality of life in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4772)|
| 1:19:39| Thanks, Nan. Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4779)|
| 1:19:41| Thank you. Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4781)|
| 1:19:43| First, the task force member that's at letter I, last name is misspelled, it's Frith, F-R-I-T-H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4783)|
| 1:19:54| I don't know if we necessarily need a formal motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4794)|
| 1:19:57| We'll just so note that and make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4797)|
| 1:19:59| The second thing, other than co-chairman Tony Norman, I don't pretend to know where all these people live,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| but I don't see anyone that's a resident of the third district on this list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4804)|
| 1:20:10| and I think it needs to include all districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4810)|
| 1:20:14| Mr. Frost, can I respond to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4814)|
| 1:20:17| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4817)|
| 1:20:18| These names came to Tony Norman and myself at our request from Mike Harbury| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4818)|
| 1:20:25| and the long-range planning staff from MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4825)|
| 1:20:28| We asked them to give us a good balanced mix of names from city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4828)|
| 1:20:32| and county that would be people representing various viewpoints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4832)|
| 1:20:37| that would be able to address this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| We did not specifically ask for names representing each city council district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| and each county commission district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4845)|
| 1:20:47| because we felt like that wasn't the most effective way of populating this task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4847)|
| 1:20:54| And so we didn't approach it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4854)|
| 1:20:58| We asked them to recommend people from throughout the city and county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4858)|
| 1:21:03| who would bring the right balance and the right mix of backgrounds and knowledge, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4863)|
| 1:21:10| because we felt like if we had nine county commission districts represented| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4870)|
| 1:21:14| and six city council districts represented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4874)|
| 1:21:18| based on districts that the focus would have been more geographical| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4878)|
| 1:21:23| and perhaps less representative on those other background kinds of things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4883)|
| 1:21:29| and we felt like that was the most important thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| We left that up to them, and they made the recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| And what we were after here is something that both city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4895)|
| 1:21:38| and county commission hopefully would support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4898)|
| 1:21:41| I certainly understand where you're going,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4901)|
| 1:21:44| but every representative of a city council district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4904)|
| 1:21:48| is also a representative of a commission district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4908)|
| 1:21:52| You know, the third district does certainly have its ridges.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4912)|
| 1:21:56| That's all I had to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4916)|
| 1:21:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4918)|
| 1:21:59| The third district does not object.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4919)|
| 1:22:03| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4923)|
| 1:22:04| Actually, Councilman Frost really went to one of the points I was going to make| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| and ask about, not specifically the third district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4927)|
| 1:22:10| but I guess to MPC because I heard that you guys did the appointing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| and chose the names and that Councilman Holquist, if I hear what he is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4934)|
| 1:22:18| that he and Commissioner Norman had no input at all on the names.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4938)|
| 1:22:21| So I was wondering how we kind of got to this list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4941)|
| 1:22:24| and I do appreciate Councilman Woodhull, who actually lives in my district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4944)|
| 1:22:28| being on the committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4948)|
| 1:22:30| but I had that thought with regards to geographic representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4950)|
| 1:22:33| because I have to disagree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4953)|
| 1:22:35| I do think that's important because there are ridges, slopes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4955)|
| 1:22:38| and hillsides all over this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4958)|
| 1:22:40| So I'll interject and say I'm sort of tagging on to what Councilman Frost said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4960)|
| 1:22:45| and hopefully we will find a way to make sure that we've got all districts represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4965)|
| 1:22:49| But the other thing is, how are we defining ridge, slope, and hillside?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4969)|
| 1:22:54| Can you give me an idea?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4974)|
| 1:22:56| Are we talking about like the mountains that we see here over in South Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4976)|
| 1:23:02| where the water tower is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4982)|
| 1:23:04| Are we talking about dealing with things as small as what we know is over in behind Chihuahua Hills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4984)|
| 1:23:11| Well, that will be part of the job of the task force| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4991)|
| 1:23:14| to help us define exactly what is important to the folks of the county and the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=4994)|
| 1:23:21| We have some criteria that are out there that we have available as far as what we've mapped already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5001)|
| 1:23:28| We have criteria that other communities have used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5008)|
| 1:23:31| So we will present all of those parameters to the task force and let them create the definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5011)|
| 1:23:37| But with regard to the list of names, in speaking with Mike Carberry this morning about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5017)|
| 1:23:43| the list that he put forward was merely a suggested list of folks who he thought had expertise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5023)|
| 1:23:50| in a broad range of approaches to the topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5030)|
| 1:23:55| and certainly didn't take into consideration the geography of where they lived or race or ethnicity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5035)|
| 1:24:03| Let me say, because the scope of the committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5043)|
| 1:24:08| and the definition of ridge slope and hillside could potentially encompass something such as the hillside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5048)|
| 1:24:16| that is behind Chihuahua Hills, for example.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5056)|
| 1:24:18| I just say that because that's fresh in our minds now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5058)|
| 1:24:21| I think that is all the more reason to possibly make sure we've got geographic issues taken into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5061)|
| 1:24:28| because who would know better than sometimes those folks who live in those districts or those areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| So I just say that as a follow-up to my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5072)|
| 1:24:37| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| Well, again, let me just go back to what I said in response to Councilman Frost's concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5079)|
| 1:24:44| We asked for those suggestions from MPC because we wanted to get a balance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5084)|
| 1:24:50| and we knew creating a joint city-county task force was going to be a challenge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5090)|
| 1:24:56| You have nine council members and 19 commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| We felt like if everyone got into looking at appointing people based on geography, on their particular concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5101)|
| 1:25:08| that that would probably be a nearly impossible task to work through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5108)|
| 1:25:14| And we didn't really know what we would end up in the final analysis, so we took this approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5114)|
| 1:25:19| And there was an attempt at commission last night, at 1130 last night, when this came up, or nearly 1130,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5119)|
| 1:25:30| there was an attempt to load additional people onto this based on other considerations by some of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5130)|
| 1:25:39| And that failed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5139)|
| 1:25:42| And I was thankful that it did because it felt like if we would have opened the Pandora's box| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5142)|
| 1:25:47| and it would have been nearly impossible to put together a task force that both city council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5147)|
| 1:25:52| and county commissions could support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| So we were appreciative that the commission supported this as it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| with the one exception of adding the one individual to address the racial representation issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5161)|
| 1:26:13| Mr. McKenzie, Commissioner McKenzie, asked about minority representation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| and Commissioner Norman responded that we had a somewhat of Hispanic background on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5178)|
| 1:26:28| And then Commissioner McKenzie said he felt like there should also be somewhat of African American heritage also represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5188)|
| 1:26:37| And we agreed that that was a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| And after the initial attempt to load a whole series of people on failed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5200)|
| 1:26:47| then Commissioner Leuthold made the motion to add this particular individual, Mr. Wade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5207)|
| 1:26:53| that Commissioner McKenzie had suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| And that was approved, the amendment was approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| and then it was approved as amended without any further attempts to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5219)|
| 1:27:04| And we feel like, and I'm sorry Commissioner Norman wasn't able to make it here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5224)|
| 1:27:09| but we felt like really the way we've approached it is the only effective way to get both bodies to agree on something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5229)|
| 1:27:17| that's going to really be a workable task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5237)|
| 1:27:20| And I appreciate Mr. McKenzie's suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5240)|
| 1:27:23| I don't know Mr. Wade, but I do think he had a valid point, and we must have diversity represented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| And just back to my point, because it may not be fair for me to mention Chihuly Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5248)|
| 1:27:32| because that is an issue that is still in debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5252)|
| 1:27:34| But one of the reasons I'm speaking about geographic representation is I'm very concerned now about an issue that has passed us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5254)|
| 1:27:40| with regards to our vote on zoning, but now it's going to be a real problem for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5260)|
| 1:27:44| and that is up on Nichols Avenue and up where the zoo is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5264)|
| 1:27:47| You know, that issue right there, and that is a ridge, a hillside, however you want to define it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| that's going to be a real problem for this city, for Chihuly Park, and for the zoo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5271)|
| 1:27:55| If that developer does what he's talking about doing, which is leveling that hill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| and putting duplexes up there, what he's going to do, but that's going to cause major water runoff, storm water problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5279)|
| 1:28:05| So I want to make sure that all geographic areas are represented so that we don't get caught up in the pristine hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5285)|
| 1:28:11| where Fort Dickerson and places like that and not forget about some neighborhoods that have real issues right in their backyards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5291)|
| 1:28:18| such as over on Nichols Avenue and where the zoo is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5298)|
| 1:28:21| So that's my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5301)|
| 1:28:24| Let me respond one more time and say that this is an open meeting task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5304)|
| 1:28:30| The meetings are going to be sunshined, and we said this last night to commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5310)|
| 1:28:34| We encourage anyone who's interested to come and to participate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5314)|
| 1:28:38| They may not be voting members of the task force, but it's a very open process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5318)|
| 1:28:43| So anytime anyone from any community has a concern or a need they want to bring to the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5323)|
| 1:28:50| they're going to be given every opportunity to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5330)|
| 1:28:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5333)|
| 1:28:54| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5334)|
| 1:28:56| Ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5336)|
| 1:28:57| All those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5337)|
| 1:28:59| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5339)|
| 1:29:00| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5340)|
| 1:29:02| I think that's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5342)|
| 1:29:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5343)|
| 1:29:04| That takes us to the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5344)|
| 1:29:05| We have one person signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5345)|
| 1:29:07| Alonzo Montgomery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5347)|
| 1:29:11| He's preaching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5351)|
| 1:29:27| Alonzo Montgomery, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| Hey, Mr. Mayor, thank you for your help this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| Chief, thank you for your help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5372)|
| 1:29:34| But we got a problem, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5374)|
| 1:29:36| You know, I support the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5376)|
| 1:29:39| I don't care if you put all them bad guys in jail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| But when y'all don't do it, when your men go, you know, over in East Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5382)|
| 1:29:47| the cops, they run rapid over there, you know, all the doggone time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5387)|
| 1:29:53| They act like they're wired up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| And I'm sort of teed off about it because they in our black community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5396)|
| 1:29:59| are trying to get a name for themselves, Chief Green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5399)|
| 1:30:02| And, you know, I'm no Prairie Red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| I'm one that don't really talk about the police department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5404)|
| 1:30:07| I'm not running behind you with no camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| But I think I did some people that I know is very dear to me a little bit of injustice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5409)|
| 1:30:15| Matter of fact, I know they did some injustice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5415)|
| 1:30:18| That's why I came up here and asked the mayor, and they did it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5418)|
| 1:30:22| to look into it to give you a call and see what y'all would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5422)|
| 1:30:25| You know, I know you're going to support your police department and your officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5425)|
| 1:30:29| I don't have a problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5429)|
| 1:30:31| But when they flat out lied to the citizens, and I know they lied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| and I was there when they lied to them, and that was my auntie they lied to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5434)|
| 1:30:39| and I really don't appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5439)|
| 1:30:41| I don't appreciate it at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5441)|
| 1:30:43| But I don't think it's an issue that I need to let 250,000 households know about it, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5443)|
| 1:30:51| Because that's the kind of household that look at this city council every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5451)|
| 1:30:55| But I will bring that dirty laundry out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5455)|
| 1:30:58| and let them know about Officer Schaefer, Officer Geddes, and J.L. Price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5458)|
| 1:31:04| I will let this whole doggone city of Knoxville and Knox County know about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5464)|
| 1:31:08| but I don't want to do that, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5468)|
| 1:31:10| And then they did call my auntie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| But when they called, he lied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5473)|
| 1:31:16| He flat out was lying on the telephone trying to brainstorm her to get more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5476)|
| 1:31:20| I know for a fact he backdated that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5480)|
| 1:31:24| The paperwork was not done, and they backdated it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| I don't have a lot of faith in the police citizen review board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5487)|
| 1:31:31| I don't have a lot of faith in them because the mayor made one good appointment with Mrs. Reed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5491)|
| 1:31:37| but some of the other appointments, Mr. Mayor, hey, when people you put on the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5497)|
| 1:31:42| they can't relate to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5502)|
| 1:31:44| They don't need to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| See, y'all getting all these folk with nice degrees on these boards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| but they can't relate to the ordinary citizen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5510)|
| 1:31:53| So, one, they ain't living in those neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5513)|
| 1:31:56| and they're just going to go along with the status quo to make themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| and everybody they're dealing with look good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5519)|
| 1:32:02| But if I have to be a Prairie Red, I'll be a Prairie Red because I don't have nothing to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| I'm unemployed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5525)|
| 1:32:07| But I'm not going to go out and buy no doggone camera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5527)|
| 1:32:10| The only thing I like about Prairie Red, now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5530)|
| 1:32:12| they did know how to defend themselves pretty good against people that's educated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5532)|
| 1:32:16| and I think I'm smarter than Prairie Red.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5536)|
| 1:32:18| As a matter of fact, I know I'm smarter than these guys,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5538)|
| 1:32:21| and I will defend myself, and I will play Prairie Mason with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5541)|
| 1:32:25| But I'm asking you tonight, Chief, that the powers that be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5545)|
| 1:32:29| someone from the Citizen Review Board, yourself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5549)|
| 1:32:32| I like Chief Green because I like him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5552)|
| 1:32:35| He's a pretty straight guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5555)|
| 1:32:37| And I like Mr. and Mrs. Tate to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5557)|
| 1:32:40| I like these officers to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5560)|
| 1:32:43| I like Tracy Powell to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5563)|
| 1:32:45| And from the U.S. Attorney's Office, we need to talk about this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5565)|
| 1:32:48| because we want that car back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5568)|
| 1:32:50| That car better come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| You know what I'm talking about, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| I tell everybody else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| We want that car back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5575)|
| 1:32:56| And like I told Schaefer, that car better be back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5576)|
| 1:33:00| When we get it back, it better be the way it was when he took it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5580)|
| 1:33:03| They better not went in there and tore up nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| And I'm dead serious, but if I have to come up here every two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5586)|
| 1:33:09| and just blast Schaefer and him, I'll do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5589)|
| 1:33:13| because I know what they're doing in these mountains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5593)|
| 1:33:16| I hang out over there every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| When I get up, Councilman Brown, that's where I go, to East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5598)|
| 1:33:24| When I go to bed, I'm leaving East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5604)|
| 1:33:27| I don't want to bring that dirty line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5607)|
| 1:33:29| I got too much respect for you, Chief, and I won't do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5609)|
| 1:33:32| I wanted to when I hung up with Schaefer today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5612)|
| 1:33:35| but once I sit down and think a little while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5615)|
| 1:33:39| I thought it would be otherwise because the mayor did do me good today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5619)|
| 1:33:43| But another thing, I'm hoping that we can sit down and y'all have this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5623)|
| 1:33:47| And I want to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| We can have this discussion soon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5628)|
| 1:33:50| because I want y'all to reverse that thing what Schaefer and them did| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5630)|
| 1:33:54| and sent that paperwork to Nashville because I know Schaefer and them lied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5634)|
| 1:33:58| I was with my aunt the night they took that car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| 30 more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5640)|
| 1:34:01| Okay, Chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5641)|
| 1:34:02| But I just stayed over there out of the way because it wasn't any of my business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5642)|
| 1:34:06| But I'm asking y'all to get involved, and I want some results.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| If I don't get no results, God, my witness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5650)|
| 1:34:12| I come up here and blast your police department every two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5652)|
| 1:34:16| And, you know, and I let them know who that snitch was, that third person,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5656)|
| 1:34:21| that y'all let go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| He was a police snitch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5664)|
| 1:34:25| Can I get a couple more minutes, Mr. Hall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5665)|
| 1:34:28| But I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| I'm telling you, honest to God,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| all the snitches that you got in East Knoxville that I knew about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5672)|
| 1:34:35| I exposed them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| And then everybody in East Knoxville will know about them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5677)|
| 1:34:40| all the other drug dealers will know about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5680)|
| 1:34:43| But I'd rather not do that, Chief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5683)|
| 1:34:45| because you did me a good favor one time and helped clean up the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5685)|
| 1:34:48| I owe you one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5688)|
| 1:34:49| And now I'm asking y'all to, hey, meet with these people and get it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| That's all I'm asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5693)|
| 1:34:55| And I hope that Mrs. Tate never hear from y'all real soon about it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5695)|
| 1:34:59| because we want that car back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5699)|
| 1:35:00| Her name is on that title.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5700)|
| 1:35:02| They didn't find no drugs in that car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5702)|
| 1:35:04| Hey, you can put them in jail for the drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5704)|
| 1:35:07| Put them in jail and throw away the key.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5707)|
| 1:35:09| I don't care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5709)|
| 1:35:11| But that one thing we want back, because no drugs bought that car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5711)|
| 1:35:16| And we know that for a fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| And the other thing I want to talk about, Mr. Merritt Ragsdale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| Manne County Commission, Mr. Merritt Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5722)|
| 1:35:25| If you're listening, you need to resign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5725)|
| 1:35:28| If Cynthia Finch and Bone and Lodge and all of them are gone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| and Warner, and the main one that needs to be gone is that doggone Chief of Staff of yours, Mike Orms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5731)|
| 1:35:38| He went on Halloran Hill one time when all that was going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| and Halloran Hill asked him what was his job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5741)|
| 1:35:43| That man couldn't even tell him his doggone job description.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5743)|
| 1:35:46| Now they got him looking like he's God.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5746)|
| 1:35:49| He needs to be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5749)|
| 1:35:51| You need to be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5751)|
| 1:35:52| And that debate needs to be gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5752)|
| 1:35:55| Fifteen more seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5755)|
| 1:35:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| If all of them had to go, them fools need to go because they ain't got no business there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5757)|
| 1:36:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5761)|
| 1:36:02| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5762)|
| 1:36:03| That being all the business that's come before us, we stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil080325?start=5765)|
