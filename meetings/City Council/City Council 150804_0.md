| 0:04:57| For the Mayor's Report, several things are coming up in the next few weeks I want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=297)|
| 0:05:02| tell you about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=302)|
| 0:05:03| This Thursday, August 6th, marks the 50th anniversary of the day that President Lyndon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=303)|
| 0:05:08| Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=308)|
| 0:05:11| To mark the occasion, the City is sponsoring a great program at the Beck Cultural Exchange| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=311)|
| 0:05:16| Center starting at 5.30 p.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=316)|
| 0:05:19| The featured speaker will be civil rights activist Joanne Bland, who was the youngest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=319)|
| 0:05:24| marcher on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama, on the day known as Bloody Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=324)|
| 0:05:31| She was just 11 years old when she joined that march, along with members of her family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=331)|
| 0:05:35| and other civil rights leaders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| She has remained active in social justice causes ever since.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=337)|
| 0:05:42| Also speaking will be Sally Liuzzo Prado, whose mother, Viola Liuzzo, was murdered while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=342)|
| 0:05:49| volunteering in those marches.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=349)|
| 0:05:52| So this will be a great opportunity to recognize the sacrifices and the work that led to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=352)|
| 0:05:57| passage of that bill in 1965.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=357)|
| 0:06:00| Again, that's at 5.30 p.m. this Thursday at the Beck Center at 1927 Dandridge Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=360)|
| 0:06:09| So then next Tuesday, August 11th, there are actually two events that are going on, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=369)|
| 0:06:14| you'll have to figure out which one you're going to go to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| At 5.00 p.m. there will be a public meeting at the East Tennessee History Center on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| 700 block of Gay Street, the infrastructure upgrades, the streetscape improvements that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| as you all know, we funded and are about to start.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=388)|
| 0:06:32| This is a major construction project that will improve the streetscape and sidewalks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=392)|
| 0:06:37| there on Gay Street between Church and Cumberland Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=397)|
| 0:06:41| It will begin this fall, and our engineering department promises that it will be finished| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=401)|
| 0:06:50| before the Rossini Festival next April.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| Thumbs up, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| So if you all want details and the drawings and the construction timeline, that meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=415)|
| 0:07:02| is at 5.00 p.m. next Tuesday at the East Tennessee History Center, 601 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=422)|
| 0:07:08| Part of that project will be really taking away our traffic calming devices, which are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=428)|
| 0:07:15| those awful bricks that are uneven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| That's what I think every time I bounce over it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=440)|
| 0:07:22| I think, well, this is a traffic calming device, but we're going to try and address that issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=442)|
| 0:07:27| So at 6.00 p.m. that same night, there will be a public meeting about the importance of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=447)|
| 0:07:32| employment for people with disabilities and how to create more opportunities for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=452)|

| 0:08:16| And one more event to mention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| On Monday, August 17th at 1.30, we're going to have a birthday party.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=498)|
| 0:08:24| The Knoxville Transit Center is turning five years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=504)|
| 0:08:27| So I think you all know what a success and a benefit that has been to our whole bus system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=507)|
| 0:08:34| to the people who ride the buses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=514)|
| 0:08:36| It's increased ridership and it's provided a really comfortable and modern hub for our transit system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=516)|
| 0:08:42| So I invite you all to join me and Don Disler and the rest of our staff and the CAT staff there that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=522)|
| 0:08:49| So that's the 17th, Monday the 17th at 1.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=529)|
| 0:08:55| And then finally, I do want to ask Chief Roush to share an award with us that the city has received.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=535)|
| 0:09:05| So first I want to congratulate you on becoming the president of the Tennessee Association of Chiefs of Police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=545)|
| 0:09:12| And I know we just had the state conference here, so tell us some about that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=552)|
| 0:09:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=557)|
| 0:09:19| And it's an honor to serve the association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| So the association at our annual conference that we had last week here in Knoxville, we topped that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=562)|
| 0:09:29| We had a wonderful week, first of all, at the convention center, the great time there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=569)|
| 0:09:34| They did an excellent job of hosting our association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=574)|
| 0:09:39| And the holiday inn, World's Fair Park, did a tremendous job as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| And we were very appreciative to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=583)|
| 0:09:46| At our annual banquet, which culminates the event, we were awarded the 2015 City Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=586)|
| 0:09:55| Vice Mayor Pavlis was able to make it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=595)|
| 0:09:57| I know you were out of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| He was able to make it to represent the city and receive the award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| I brought it tonight to be able to officially present it to you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=602)|
| 0:10:05| The City Award is given to a city that gives their support and assistance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=605)|
| 0:10:10| in the pursuit of the goals and objectives of the Tennessee Association of Chiefs of Police.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=610)|
| 0:10:14| And so because of the great work that our city has provided to the association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=614)|
| 0:10:20| the association honored us by awarding us the City Award for 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=620)|
| 0:10:26| Great. Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=626)|
| 0:10:28| It's because of your work and your folks that we got this, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=628)|
| 0:10:44| Tennessee Association of Chiefs of Police, 2015 City Award.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=644)|
| 0:10:50| City of Knoxville, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=650)|
| 0:10:52| Pass along our thanks to them as well. I'm sure you already did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| Okay, so that's the end of my report, council reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=656)|
| 0:11:01| Councilman Grieve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=661)|
| 0:11:03| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| There's a couple of important events that are coming up this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=664)|
| 0:11:07| And the one that I want to remind my colleagues about is the Everly Brothers Park dedication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=667)|
| 0:11:13| which will be this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=673)|
| 0:11:14| There will be an ice cream social and a dedication of the park area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=674)|
| 0:11:19| We have invited some special guests that we're not sure whether they'll attend or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=679)|
| 0:11:23| but there's a good possibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=683)|
| 0:11:25| And that's at 530 at the park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=685)|
| 0:11:28| I want to thank my colleagues for the July 7th meeting for naming that area the Everly Brothers Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=688)|
| 0:11:35| So that will take place this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=695)|
| 0:11:37| So I wanted to announce that, and the mayor will be there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=697)|
| 0:11:39| Will you be leading the singing and all of the Everly Brothers songs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=699)|
| 0:11:43| Wake up, little Susie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| Everybody practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=705)|
| 0:11:48| You said I need to practice?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=708)|
| 0:11:49| I said everybody practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=709)|
| 0:11:51| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| More diplomatic than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=712)|
| 0:11:54| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=717)|
| 0:11:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=719)|
| 0:12:00| A couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=720)|
| 0:12:01| The community schools have been a real boost to the academic achievement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=721)|
| 0:12:06| and some social needs of segments of our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=726)|
| 0:12:10| This afternoon, Tim Graham contributed $5,000 to the Norwood Elementary Community School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=730)|
| 0:12:17| and this is his first time, and he, I think, was impressed with the things he saw going on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| They have a new director this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=743)|
| 0:12:26| And Tuesday of next week, a week from tonight, the first full day of school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=746)|
| 0:12:31| the Northwest Middle Community School will open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=751)|
| 0:12:34| and this is the first middle school community school in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=754)|
| 0:12:39| Middle school community schools are not very common throughout the U.S.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=759)|
| 0:12:45| and that's probably the age that kids are most vulnerable in making positive choices, negative choices,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=765)|
| 0:12:54| or we're not sure but we want to make some kind of a choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=774)|
| 0:12:57| So I'm excited that Northwest Middle is going to be the first in Knox County to do this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=777)|
| 0:13:04| and I know that Liz will do a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=786)|
| 0:13:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=787)|
| 0:13:08| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=788)|
| 0:13:09| Yes, Mayor, I just wanted to announce about the, on 8th of August, next Saturday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=789)|
| 0:13:15| there will be celebrating the 40th anniversary of the Beck Center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| and also our remembrances of the 8th of August is dealing with the emancipation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=800)|
| 0:13:28| and I think, Mayor, you will be speaking, I believe, at Chihuly Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=808)|
| 0:13:33| The event will start at 9 at the cemetery at Knoxville College| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=813)|
| 0:13:38| and then travel to Chihuly Park for the opening ceremonies that begin at 10.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=818)|
| 0:13:44| So I just want to make that announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=824)|
| 0:13:46| Great. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=826)|
| 0:13:48| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| I thought maybe Mayor Brown was going to announce this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=830)|
| 0:13:52| He and I share some of the sidewalk improvements along Sutherland Avenue,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=832)|
| 0:13:56| and at 4.30 this Friday, prior to the Everly Brothers Dedication Park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=836)|
| 0:14:01| we will be at the corner of Hollywood and Sutherland Avenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| to cut the ribbons for the new sidewalk and the crosswalks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=844)|
| 0:14:07| As I said, Mayor Brown and I, we kind of work that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=847)|
| 0:14:13| In fact, Hollywood is our borderline, but we share the same on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=853)|
| 0:14:16| So that will be Friday at 4.30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=856)|
| 0:14:19| And we appreciate your cooperation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=859)|
| 0:14:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=861)|
| 0:14:22| Collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| Collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| Your collaboration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=865)|
| 0:14:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=866)|
| 0:14:27| Councilman Dallavope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=867)|
| 0:14:28| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| This is maybe a minor item, but last Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| MPC had a meeting about cell towers, and it was kind of a workshop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=873)|
| 0:14:38| and Mr. Perry was their consultant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| And there was a slide and a scary image that I think should give us some food for thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=881)|
| 0:14:48| I don't know how to describe it other than to say that they had a grid| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=888)|
| 0:14:51| that looked like a chicken wire fence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=891)|
| 0:14:54| and every one of those little squares was one square mile,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=894)|
| 0:14:57| and it was hypothecated by some that given the growth in data| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=897)|
| 0:15:03| and in streaming and whatnot that it's not inconceivable we could have one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=903)|
| 0:15:09| or more cell towers every square mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=909)|
| 0:15:11| And I thought that would leave us a city of porcupines,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| and I hope that we find some way to be more creative than that as we go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=915)|
| 0:15:22| There was a hope expressed that technology would save us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=922)|
| 0:15:25| but I don't know whether it will save us or doom us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=925)|
| 0:15:28| But that was kind of a frightening picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| It's amazing now just to see sometimes you'll look up and see two or three in one direction on a horizon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=930)|
| 0:15:35| but to see one or more every square mile.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=935)|
| 0:15:38| They said there were seven cell tower companies that actually are active in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=938)|
| 0:15:44| They can put about three on one pole, one set of receivers or transmitters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=944)|
| 0:15:51| But there are a total of 13, and I guess any one of them can ask to be cut into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=951)|
| 0:15:56| and according to the workshop at least under the Federal Communication Act,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=956)|
| 0:16:01| you couldn't say no almost if they made their case that they needed that kind of frequency| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=961)|
| 0:16:08| and range for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=968)|
| 0:16:10| So I just throw that out as food for thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=970)|
| 0:16:13| We don't want to become a city of porcupines, so we need to be thinking how we avoid that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| Well, in response to Councilman De La Vope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=982)|
| 0:16:24| one way we could not become porcupines is to all give up this technology that we hold near and dear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=984)|
| 0:16:31| and for most of us we don't want it in our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=991)|
| 0:16:34| but when we go through your neighborhood we want to be sure that we have that contact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=994)|
| 0:16:39| So that balancing act is a real challenge, and as they pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=999)|
| 0:16:43| I really hope we get some technology that will make all these towers obsolete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1003)|
| 0:16:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1009)|
| 0:16:51| Mr. Johnson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1011)|
| 0:16:55| 9A is an ordinance to amend Chapter 17, Article 8, Section 17-446 of the Knoxville City Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1015)|
| 0:17:03| to add language specifying the distance a motor vehicle must allow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1023)|
| 0:17:06| when overtaking and passing a vehicle, excuse me, a bicycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1026)|
| 0:17:10| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1030)|
| 0:17:11| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1031)|
| 0:17:12| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1032)|
| 0:17:13| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| I understand that this motion is coming forth for a variety of reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| We have a state law that says the identical thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1040)|
| 0:17:23| and it strikes me that this is very redundant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1043)|
| 0:17:26| and I'm not seeing a need to have a city ordinance that says the same thing a state law says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1046)|
| 0:17:32| As a matter of fact, I was thinking about this a couple of days ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| and I came upon a car and it had a license plate that had a bicycle, a car, and a three-foot circle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| So this is clearly something that's important to the state, it's important to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1062)|
| 0:17:46| but I just really think this is a very redundant law that we don't need on the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1066)|
| 0:17:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1072)|
| 0:17:54| Councilman Delvaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1074)|
| 0:17:55| Well, as someone said at the last meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1075)|
| 0:17:56| the flip side of that was that it gave our local police officers an ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| they could enforce if they saw a violation and could take them to city court| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1082)|
| 0:18:06| and we wouldn't have to be dependent on a big brother, so to speak, to enforce it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1086)|
| 0:18:11| So anyone who's been on a bicycle and has the experience of those cars coming up behind you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1091)|
| 0:18:16| will appreciate having a three-foot wide girth as the cars go around you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| It's kind of scary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| I think it's useful in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1102)|
| 0:18:24| It's true that we're not changing any rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1104)|
| 0:18:26| but we are making it clear to anyone who sits down in the evening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| and reads the Knoxville Code on vehicles and bicycles that they should leave three feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| When passing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1117)|

| 0:23:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| I emailed Mr. Hagerman this afternoon or yesterday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1409)|
| 0:23:33| about H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1413)|
| 0:23:34| I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| and J.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| because they were, again, overruns on projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1416)|
| 0:23:38| and I was just curious about that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| but he informed me that we also save money on projects| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| and we don't get those reports as frequently as we get the overruns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1425)|
| 0:23:49| So I was a little disturbed but I'm over it now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1429)|
| 0:23:52| and I'd like us to know when we are saving money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1432)|
| 0:23:55| as well as when we're spending it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1435)|
| 0:23:57| I just do want to, because we did talk about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1437)|
| 0:24:00| to say an overrun isn't exactly accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1440)|
| 0:24:02| What it is is often we add when we get into a project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| there's opportunities that we can then take advantage of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1445)|
| 0:24:09| and so we end up changing the scope as we get into a project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| This is still within the budget that has been budgeted for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1453)|
| 0:24:18| It's just more than the original contract price| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1458)|
| 0:24:20| because we run into problems that we weren't aware of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| and then we run into opportunities that we can tack something on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1463)|
| 0:24:27| which would help us in the long run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| So it's not really accurate to say overruns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| but it is an amendment because of either an unexpected problem| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1472)|
| 0:24:37| or an opportunity to take advantage of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| But thank you for bringing that up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| And there are times, as he mentioned, that the scope is correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| or there's something we don't have to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| and we end up saving money on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1490)|
| 0:24:54| Just a question on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1494)|
| 0:24:55| If there's not a budget amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1495)|
| 0:24:57| is it safe to assume that it's still within the budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1497)|
| 0:24:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1499)|
| 0:25:01| Is that right, Jim?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| So all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1512)|
| 0:25:13| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1513)|
| 0:25:16| Item 11-I is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| to amend contract number C-15-0135| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1518)|
| 0:25:23| with the Design and Construction Services, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1523)|
| 0:25:25| for the 2015 Curbs Cuts project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1525)|
| 0:25:27| increasing the contract amount by $18,891| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1527)|
| 0:25:32| for a new contract total of $347,537| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| and extending the date of completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1536)|
| 0:25:39| I think when you spoke there was an $18,891.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1539)|
| 0:25:42| I think you said $391.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1542)|
| 0:25:44| I want to be sure the record's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1548)|
| 0:25:49| Contract amount by $18,891.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1552)|
| 0:25:53| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1553)|
| 0:25:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1554)|
| 0:25:55| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1555)|
| 0:25:56| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1556)|
| 0:25:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1557)|
| 0:25:58| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1558)|
| 0:25:59| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1559)|
| 0:26:02| 11-J is a resolution authorizing the mayor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1562)|
| 0:26:04| to amend contract number C-13-0305| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1564)|
| 0:26:09| with Vaughan and Melton Consulting Engineers, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1569)|
| 0:26:13| for the Gay Street Streetscapes Project 700 block,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1573)|
| 0:26:17| increasing the amount by $77,240| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1577)|
| 0:26:21| for a total contract amount of $174,510| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1581)|
| 0:26:26| and extending the date of completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1589)|
| 0:26:30| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1590)|
| 0:26:31| Councilman Della Vothe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1591)|
| 0:26:32| This is one that fits Ms. Palmer's original question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| and maybe Jim Hagerman can explain it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| but we started out with a $77,000 contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1598)|
| 0:26:41| and now we're at $174,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1601)|
| 0:26:44| and I'm sure that there's obviously some scope creep,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1604)|
| 0:26:47| but this is now the second change order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1607)|
| 0:26:49| Could you just give us a touch of the history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| not all of it, just a touch of it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| I'm Jim Hagerman, Director of Engineering for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1614)|
| 0:26:57| Am I coming through here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| Do I need to get closer to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1621)|
| 0:27:03| There's been several changes with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| and part of it is just working in the downtown area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1625)|
| 0:27:09| where it's been in place for 150 years, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1629)|
| 0:27:17| We've got old stuff in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| Is that an engineering term?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| Mysteries underground is what you're telling me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1646)|
| 0:27:29| Mysteries underground is a good one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1649)|
| 0:27:31| We discovered before the last change order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1651)|
| 0:27:36| we discovered that the stormwater pipe was vitrified clay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1656)|
| 0:27:44| and was crumbling away and barely holding up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1664)|
| 0:27:47| so we had to basically redesign the whole drainage system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| so that all the elevations and slopes worked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1670)|
| 0:27:54| This time we've added some pedestrian-friendly features| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1674)|
| 0:27:59| and sort of as an oversight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| and I probably should take most of the blame on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1683)|
| 0:28:06| as an oversight, originally we didn't include signal modifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| traffic signal modifications in the scope,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| and we sort of added those at the tail end of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1693)|
| 0:28:18| The change order picks up that extra work that is good for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| is what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Yes, and it's one of those opportunities where you have the hole open,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1703)|
| 0:28:27| you can lay your communication cable in there a whole lot cheaper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1707)|
| 0:28:31| than coming back and ripping up the street later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1711)|
| 0:28:34| so it may have been an oversight on our part,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| but the time to have that particular oversight is now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1718)|
| 0:28:42| rather than when we have it all finished and we say, oh, geez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1722)|
| 0:28:47| So you're a surgeon doing exploratory surgery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1727)|
| 0:28:50| and you found something bad and you're taking it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1730)|
| 0:28:53| Well, going back later and fixing it after it's all done is the worst outcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1733)|
| 0:28:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1738)|

| 0:30:47| as part of the Naloxone Initiative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1850)|
| 0:30:51| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1851)|
| 0:30:52| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1852)|
| 0:30:53| This is too exotic to not ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1853)|
| 0:30:56| Maybe the chief can tell us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1856)|
| 0:30:57| It sounds like you come up and some druggie's twitching| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1857)|
| 0:31:00| and you give him a needle and bring him back or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1860)|
| 0:31:02| but tell us what's going on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| What is this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1864)|
| 0:31:06| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1866)|
| 0:31:07| So what Naloxone is, it's an opioid inhibitor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| So what the program is is to provide officers a nasal spray.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1870)|
| 0:31:17| So it's not a needle, but it'll be a nasal injector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1877)|
| 0:31:22| And what the purpose was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1882)|
| 0:31:24| we come upon someone in a medical distress from an overdose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1884)|
| 0:31:29| as a result of opioids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| So that could be heroin or any of the classifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1891)|
| 0:31:35| This will give the officer the ability to bring that person back to life, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1895)|
| 0:31:40| It is an inhibitor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1900)|
| 0:31:43| so it stops the negative impact of the drug and reverses it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1903)|
| 0:31:49| And so what we know from projects in other states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| this has been one of the greatest advantages for law enforcement to save lives| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1914)|
| 0:32:00| because we generally are the first people to arrive on the scene of these type of incidents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1920)|
| 0:32:05| Are you concerned about potential liability if something happens when the guy gets the spray?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1925)|
| 0:32:10| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1930)|
| 0:32:13| The state law has allowed us immunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1933)|
| 0:32:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1937)|
| 0:32:18| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1938)|
| 0:32:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1939)|
| 0:32:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| So we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1943)|
| 0:32:24| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1944)|
| 0:32:25| The ayes have it and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| 11-0 is a resolution requesting the Industrial Development Board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1948)|
| 0:32:31| to exercise its option to purchase from the former State Supreme Court property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1951)|
| 0:32:36| located at 719 Locust Street from the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1959)|
| 0:32:40| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1960)|
| 0:32:41| We have Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1961)|
| 0:32:43| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1963)|
| 0:32:45| I'd just like to hear what the timeline is for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| and also talk about it, I guess, with 12A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| I mean, there's parts of 12A that we're approving later for $750,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| that are applying towards this as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1979)|
| 0:33:01| I think it would be appropriate to kind of talk about that all at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| As much as I'm in favor of buying this building, I'd like to know what the timeline is expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1985)|
| 0:33:11| And I'd also like to hear discussion about the comment that the guidance for this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1991)|
| 0:33:17| can be found in the recent ULI report and what is intended by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=1997)|
| 0:33:21| And there were several things mentioned about the State Supreme Court building in the ULI report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2001)|
| 0:33:27| and I want to make sure that we're clear on what part of that is guiding the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2007)|
| 0:33:32| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2012)|
| 0:33:33| Mr. Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2013)|
| 0:33:34| Bob Wetzel, Office of Redevelopment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2014)|
| 0:33:36| Glad to answer your questions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2016)|
| 0:33:38| I'll try to take them in the order you gave them, and then when I leave out, come back and ask again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2018)|
| 0:33:43| Timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2023)|
| 0:33:44| Tonight just kind of kicks off a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2024)|
| 0:33:47| I guess the process got kicked off during the budgeting process earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2027)|
| 0:33:51| Tonight we're asking that you authorize IDB to move up forward on their option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2031)|
| 0:33:56| Their board meets on August the 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| We're hoping they will approve that at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2038)|
| 0:34:01| Then we will have 90 days from the time we say, yes, we want the option to close on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2041)|
| 0:34:09| When we close on the property, we will immediately work with the PBA operations unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2049)|
| 0:34:14| to secure the buildings that are on site, make sure they're secure when we take possession of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2054)|
| 0:34:19| And then we'll also use the parking lot that is there immediately to start gaining revenue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2059)|
| 0:34:23| and support things such as a convention center, the Sun Sphere, and libraries right next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2063)|
| 0:34:28| So we have those options right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2068)|
| 0:34:30| So as part of the process during this timeline, we're asking the Budget 12A for an amendment for $700,000 or $750,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2070)|
| 0:34:40| there for a Supreme Court site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2080)|
| 0:34:42| $70,000 of that is my fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2082)|
| 0:34:44| When I first put in my budget amendment, I said it's 2.4, 2.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2084)|
| 0:34:47| That's the number I've used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2087)|
| 0:34:48| It's really 2.47 is what it should have been, $2,470,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2088)|
| 0:34:54| Then there's also an asbestos removal cost of $375,000 estimated on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2094)|
| 0:35:00| A demolition of the office building is right at $200,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2100)|
| 0:35:04| Now, there are two buildings on that site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2104)|
| 0:35:06| There's the old courthouse and there's the office building behind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2106)|
| 0:35:09| We have pricing on both, but we're just asking for money to take down the office tower| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2109)|
| 0:35:16| if we decide that's what we want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| And I'll come back to that in just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| Another part of that is there's another $100,000 for soft costs and contingencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| That's how you get to $750,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| You've got the acquisition, soft contingency, demolition, and asbestos removal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| During this time, we've already had a Phase I on the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2131)|
| 0:35:34| We're working to a Phase II on the site right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2134)|
| 0:35:38| If we decide to go down the brownfield route, we'll go in one direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2138)|
| 0:35:42| If we choose not to go that route, we'll go in a different direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2142)|
| 0:35:45| But we're trying to get all that environmental cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2145)|
| 0:35:48| So that's kind of the timeline and the budgeting for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2148)|
| 0:35:51| The comment from ULI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2151)|
| 0:35:52| ULI did make several comments when they were in town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| One of their comments was when you go forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| because we've had two failed RFP processes on this property in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| is that you have a very clear idea when you go forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| what it is that you want out of the property this time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2165)|
| 0:36:08| so that developers can kind of respond in an apples-to-apples type comparison| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2168)|
| 0:36:12| as opposed to an apples-to-oranges comparison.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| If you remember the last time, we had hotels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| We had office buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| We had residential units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2179)|
| 0:36:21| We had retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2181)|
| 0:36:22| And while we all think we want it mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2182)|
| 0:36:24| their guidance to us is be a little more specific in the way that you want to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2184)|
| 0:36:28| They gave other guidance on public use opportunities there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| We certainly are not including that when we say follow the ULI guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2192)|
| 0:36:36| So I hope that answers that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2196)|
| 0:36:38| So we feel like we've got a pretty good plan going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| We will acquire the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| We will make sure we know what the environmental risks are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2203)|
| 0:36:46| We will take proper things to mitigate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2206)|
| 0:36:48| and then we'll move forward with probably a directed RFP process sometime next year, early next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2208)|
| 0:36:55| So what's the strategy to buy it, remove asbestos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2215)|
| 0:37:00| to demo the buildings when our intention is to turn around and sell it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2220)|
| 0:37:03| Why would we do that and spend that money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| Once again, those decisions have not been totally made to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2226)|
| 0:37:08| The strategy would be to have the money in place if we chose to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2228)|
| 0:37:12| If, in fact, we get into a discussion of what the uses can be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| and that can take a while, you make those decisions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2236)|
| 0:37:19| we might decide it would be useful to take down that building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2239)|
| 0:37:22| the old building, the office tower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2242)|
| 0:37:24| and convert that into a parking resource at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2244)|
| 0:37:27| That would be one of the big advantages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| Plus, we don't have the liability of it sitting there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2249)|
| 0:37:33| But you're spending another $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2253)|
| 0:37:35| I mean, do you think it makes that property $500,000 more valuable if you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2255)|
| 0:37:41| Well, I could put it to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2261)|
| 0:37:43| We're discounted on the purchase price at least that much because of environmental remediation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2263)|
| 0:37:47| When we went back and did some negotiating with the state| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2267)|
| 0:37:50| and decided we'd be fine sticking with this deal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2270)|
| 0:37:54| we think we can potentially get that from the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| Once again, another thing I did mention, we are doing a market study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2277)|
| 0:38:01| We're working with KCDC to get a market study on both Jackson Avenue and the Supreme Court site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2281)|
| 0:38:07| The Jackson Avenue study started earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2287)|
| 0:38:10| so we're hoping to get that back to help give us guidance, too, on what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2290)|
| 0:38:14| And they may decide that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2294)|
| 0:38:16| you can move a little quicker on the Supreme Court than you can on Jackson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| because it's a more self-contained site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2299)|
| 0:38:21| So that may link from Jackson as we go forward in this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2301)|
| 0:38:25| So you'll have 90 days from August the 10th, and that'll be your due diligence period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2305)|
| 0:38:30| So that puts you at the end of November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2310)|
| 0:38:33| You'd close on it, assuming all that went well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2313)|
| 0:38:37| You'd close on it by the end of the year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2317)|
| 0:38:38| and then start the public process on what that RFP ought to look like in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2318)|
| 0:38:42| I think we could do that before we got to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2322)|
| 0:38:44| I think that would happen before we got to there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2324)|
| 0:38:46| You see doing that this fall, then go ahead and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2326)|
| 0:38:48| I would think there would be part of that occurring this fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| So you think there would be a public process for what an RFP could look like and what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2330)|
| 0:38:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| Now, of course, I won't be here this fall, so I can say yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| But you did make a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| You put that in writing, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| We read that into the records.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| I got you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2350)|
| 0:39:11| I was thinking for $500,000 roughly there for the demo and asbestos removal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| I mean, I guess I'm not really under really understanding that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| I mean, yeah, you limit your liability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| You're not going to make the money back on the parking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| and it's probably doubtful whether you can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| And once again, I hear your point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2366)|
| 0:39:28| And once again, to emphasize, we haven't decided to commit that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2368)|
| 0:39:30| but we want a budget there if we decide to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2370)|
| 0:39:33| Then we'd have to bring a contract to do that back to the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2373)|
| 0:39:35| And you'd have to bring a contract back to us to approve anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2375)|
| 0:39:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2377)|
| 0:39:39| I think it's a really key piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2379)|
| 0:39:42| I've said that many times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2382)|
| 0:39:44| I think it's a property we need to get right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| and I think it needs the appropriate amount of time to understand that and get that right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2386)|
| 0:39:51| It is complicated, but it's a real important piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| and I think it's real critical to the downtown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| I definitely support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2398)|
| 0:40:00| I almost questioned part of that strategy, but we'll talk about that later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2400)|
| 0:40:04| I just hadn't seen that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2404)|
| 0:40:05| It wasn't in my packet, and I didn't ask you about it before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| Fair enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2409)|
| 0:40:10| Not all that was a surprise, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| No, that's right. That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| That's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2414)|
| 0:40:15| All right. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| We agree it's a critical piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2416)|
| 0:40:18| so we'll be working with you all as we move forward on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2418)|
| 0:40:21| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2421)|
| 0:40:22| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2422)|
| 0:40:24| Two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2424)|
| 0:40:25| One is you talked about contaminants, and I heard the asbestos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| but this is a Supreme Court building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2427)|
| 0:40:29| There's nothing but hot air.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2429)|
| 0:40:30| There shouldn't be any residual contaminants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| That's just lawyer's talk, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2432)|
| 0:40:33| We'll open the windows and air it out sometime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2433)|
| 0:40:35| Air it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2435)|
| 0:40:36| The other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| Do you ever have to practice there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| I've been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2440)|
| 0:40:44| I thought he might know what was in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| Cutting through it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| You mentioned something that I was concerned about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2449)|
| 0:40:51| and I think you defused it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2451)|
| 0:40:53| was you weren't talking about all of the recommendations in the ULI report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2453)|
| 0:40:56| No, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2456)|
| 0:40:57| And I recall there was some talk about moving the Civic Auditorium to Henley Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2457)|
| 0:41:03| We're not talking about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2463)|
| 0:41:04| There was that discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2464)|
| 0:41:05| and nothing in here implies that we're moving in that direction at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2468)|
| 0:41:09| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2469)|
| 0:41:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Yes, Mr. Wilson, what's the age on that building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2472)|
| 0:41:14| When was that building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| The office building, I want to say, is probably in the 50s, 40s, and 50s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2476)|
| 0:41:22| The Supreme Court is a little bit before that, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2482)|
| 0:41:25| The marble structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2485)|
| 0:41:27| It's been vacant about how long now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2487)|
| 0:41:29| A long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2489)|
| 0:41:30| At least a decade, I would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2490)|
| 0:41:32| since the Supreme Court moved across the street here to the courthouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2495)|
| 0:41:36| Quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2496)|
| 0:41:37| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2497)|
| 0:41:40| We'll give you a tour here soon, and we'll let you see what you're buying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2500)|
| 0:41:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| I'd like to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| Thank you all for that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2509)|
| 0:41:50| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2510)|
| 0:41:52| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2512)|
| 0:41:53| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2513)|
| 0:41:56| 11P is a resolution approving a tax increment financing amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2516)|
| 0:42:00| to the Magnolia Warehouse District Redevelopment and Urban Renewal Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2520)|
| 0:42:04| prepared by Knoxville's Community Development Corporation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2524)|
| 0:42:07| to support the redevelopment of real property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2527)|
| 0:42:09| located at 120 South Central Street and 122 South Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2529)|
| 0:42:14| Move for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2534)|
| 0:42:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| Councilman Grieve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2536)|
| 0:42:17| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2537)|
| 0:42:18| I've benefited myself from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| having worked with the group that's putting this together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2543)|
| 0:42:24| Councilman Delevaux.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2544)|
| 0:42:25| Yes, thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| Well, I like the idea of restoring that part of the old city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2547)|
| 0:42:31| and certainly that building, at least the corner building, is pretty run down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| and you can walk by and smell the decay actually coming from the rotted wood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2555)|
| 0:42:39| and whatnot as you walk down the side street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2559)|
| 0:42:42| I was concerned, again, that we slipped up to 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| Is that the best we can do on the TIF in terms of deferring taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| I realize it's probably a pretty expensive proposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| You had something like $4.5 million or something committed to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2574)|
| 0:42:58| It's a $4.7 million project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2578)|
| 0:43:00| On the time frame, we tried to limit the pilots to 12 years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2580)|
| 0:43:04| which is two years for construction, 10 years for benefit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2584)|
| 0:43:07| because the TIF, the money comes up front in the form of a loan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2587)|
| 0:43:10| It basically matches up with typical loan timing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2590)|
| 0:43:14| and that's why we're at 15 years on the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2594)|
| 0:43:16| They're fairly typical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| If you look back in the past, we did a lot of 20-year TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2597)|
| 0:43:19| We're now trying to keep those down to 15 if possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2599)|
| 0:43:22| Time frames can move depending on the project, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2602)|
| 0:43:27| There was a curious history of that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| Do you know what those three side doors were used for in the 70s?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2609)|
| 0:43:33| That was not a part of the loan application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2613)|
| 0:43:35| I have not investigated that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2615)|
| 0:43:37| There used to be semis pulling off the interstate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2617)|
| 0:43:40| and visiting young ladies of the night in that place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2620)|
| 0:43:43| They had three different colored doors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| It was a very exciting part of Knoxville's history, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2624)|
| 0:43:48| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2628)|
| 0:43:51| Things are a lot better unsaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2631)|
| 0:43:52| You should know that from the TVA Towers looking down at the semis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| Some things are a lot better unsaid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2635)|
| 0:43:57| That, along with the little bar on the little section of State Street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2637)|
| 0:44:03| there was a little bar there that I think, if they didn't find them there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| they went over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2646)|
| 0:44:07| They went over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2647)|
| 0:44:09| The three doors were filled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2654)|
| 0:44:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2655)|
| 0:44:17| Daniel Smith is here tonight, and it's one of the partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2657)|
| 0:44:19| I think it would be appropriate to be introduced to him and hear about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| We might have a couple more questions after that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| The whole partnership group is here, Daniel and T.C. and the group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2667)|
| 0:44:30| Meet them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2670)|
| 0:44:31| They're fresh, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| Daniel Smith, 810 Henley Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2673)|
| 0:44:39| T.C. Whitaker, 3860 Donaldson Drive, Atlanta, Georgia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2679)|
| 0:44:44| Jared Smith, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2684)|
| 0:44:47| Now, we have two other partners in our group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2687)|
| 0:44:49| and we've been working on this site for probably coming on six months now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2689)|
| 0:44:54| and really longer before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| I think we talked to the property owner about a year ago to the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2696)|
| 0:44:59| But instead of me, we have T.C. Whitaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2699)|
| 0:45:02| who's kind of been taking the lead on this TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| and really he's prepared here to kind of talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2706)|
| 0:45:11| The first thing I would like to say is I'm sure you all know this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2711)|
| 0:45:14| but working with Mr. Wetzel in his office has been a real pleasure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2714)|
| 0:45:18| I've been a part of some other developments, not in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| in some other municipalities that have been quite difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2722)|
| 0:45:25| but having Mr. Wetzel in his office to work with is a real gem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| The city of Knoxville will definitely miss him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2729)|
| 0:45:31| I know he's moving on to greener pastures,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2731)|
| 0:45:34| and he will be a big miss for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2734)|
| 0:45:37| This is a great project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| Being from Knoxville, having grown up here, actually growing up in Halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| having the opportunity to do something good for the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2745)|
| 0:45:48| to take a blighted piece of property and turn it around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2748)|
| 0:45:51| and have it be something that I think would be very beneficial for the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2751)|
| 0:45:56| and for the taxpayers, for that matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| Having some back taxes owed on one of the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2759)|
| 0:46:03| and having the opportunity to change that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2763)|
| 0:46:05| and at the same time increasing the tax revenue for the city I think is a very good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2765)|
| 0:46:11| The term that we talked about earlier, just so you know, we looked at 15-year, 10-year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2771)|
| 0:46:19| When you look at the difference of that, it's approximately about $140,000 difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2779)|
| 0:46:24| when you change that from 15 years to 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| And looking at the overall financing of the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| let's do the quick math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| Approximately 3% of the total value of the project there that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2793)|
| 0:46:38| So it is a substantial amount when you move from 15 to 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2798)|
| 0:46:42| And working with Mr. Wetzel in his office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| it just became clear that 15-year was really where we needed to be on the term of the TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| in order to make it make sense financially for our development group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2809)|
| 0:46:53| I realize that you take on a little extra when you tackle a building like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2813)|
| 0:46:57| that has both burdens and limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2817)|
| 0:47:00| It just comes from the direction of the eagerness to see the city realize the future value of the assessments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2820)|
| 0:47:09| And shorter would be better in that sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2829)|
| 0:47:11| That's the reason I asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2831)|
| 0:47:13| One thing that we're really excited about is that we're going to be bringing 15 units to that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| approximately 30 new members living down in the old city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2840)|
| 0:47:24| shopping in downtown, using all the facilities down there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2844)|
| 0:47:28| And it's something that when we met with the Old City Business Owners Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2848)|
| 0:47:32| they're really excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2852)|
| 0:47:34| Additionally, we're trying to fill that desire for that urban design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2854)|
| 0:47:38| that is going to include 7,000 square foot of retail space on the first floor that we're really excited about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2858)|
| 0:47:45| And we appreciate the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2865)|
| 0:47:49| So true mixed use, you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2869)|
| 0:47:51| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2871)|
| 0:47:52| Congressman Wallace, I think, still has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2872)|
| 0:47:54| I think that doesn't bring up a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2874)|
| 0:47:56| And there will be 15 units for sale, and the ones that I'm most familiar with have been for rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2876)|
| 0:48:03| So I think it's a, you know, Bob, you said there's been some history where we've done TIFs on properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2883)|
| 0:48:10| that have ended up selling, and explain how the taxes work on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2890)|
| 0:48:15| These guys will sell it, but they're not necessarily off the hook for that TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2895)|
| 0:48:19| Well, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| They will be on the hook for the TIF loan until it's paid off, okay, however long period that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2900)|
| 0:48:25| So they sell those 15 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2905)|
| 0:48:27| In a TIF, one thing that's different than the pilot, we collect the taxes as we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2907)|
| 0:48:31| And then that new tax increment is dedicated towards servicing that debt, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2911)|
| 0:48:37| So that's going to go on whether they, if they can sell them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2917)|
| 0:48:41| then the new owners will be paying those taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2921)|
| 0:48:44| If they don't sell them, they'll be paying those taxes at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2924)|
| 0:48:47| That will pay for the debt, and there's no recourse back to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| So they'll be on the hook the entire time on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2930)|
| 0:48:52| And if that new owner doesn't pay it, then if he doesn't pay it, then they're still responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2932)|
| 0:48:55| Yeah, they're still responsible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| We've kind of got double protection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2936)|
| 0:48:58| Yeah, we're double protected on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| And we haven't used a lot of TIFs in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| You may see more down the road, guys, because they started falling out of favor in 2008,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| and we went to pilots as the economy went down, and we moved from a condo market to a rental market.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| The Holston building was done along this model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2952)|
| 0:49:15| The Burwell building was done along this model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2955)|
| 0:49:17| Mass General Store was done along this model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2957)|
| 0:49:19| So this is a very common model that we're actually glad to see coming back into the economy again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2959)|
| 0:49:25| Well, guys, I think it's great, and good luck with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2965)|
| 0:49:28| We look forward to seeing it to its completion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2968)|
| 0:49:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2971)|
| 0:49:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2972)|
| 0:49:33| Mayor Brown?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2973)|
| 0:49:34| Yes, I had a question before you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2974)|
| 0:49:36| In terms of the condominiums, you'll be selling some, you'll be renting some.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| Can you say now roughly what kind of price range you would be looking at for the condominiums as well as apartments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2980)|
| 0:49:50| We would hope to sell as many as we can as fast as we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| and if we do retain any because of market conditions, then we would rent those at market rates, whatever they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=2994)|
| 0:50:03| Right now, from a sales standpoint, there will be a variety of unit options,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3003)|
| 0:50:07| so it depends on a couple different factors, but starting, you know, maybe somewhere around $250,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3007)|
| 0:50:15| I see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3015)|
| 0:50:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3016)|
| 0:50:17| One of the things that I'm interested in downtown is greater diversity in our downtown population, which we really do not have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3017)|
| 0:50:26| And that's one reason I'm asking that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3026)|
| 0:50:29| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3029)|
| 0:50:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3032)|

| 0:53:12| Thank you, Mayor, and thank you, Councilmembers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| My name is George Piper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| I live at 5405 River Bend Drive in Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3195)|
| 0:53:19| I'm here tonight as an agent of Lawler Wood Housing, now known as LHP.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3199)|
| 0:53:24| With me is Walter Gostin, the resident service coordinator at Town View Towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3204)|
| 0:53:29| and the chairman of LHP, Phil Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| Our application tonight is in support of changing the name of Town View Drive from Town View Drive to another name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| It's part of a three-step strategy that Lawler Wood is working on at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3219)|
| 0:53:43| to help reinvigorate that part of town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3223)|
| 0:53:45| The steps are these three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3225)|
| 0:53:47| First, the redevelopment and revitalization of Town View Towers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3227)|
| 0:53:51| with $10 million worth of investment and improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| and additionally, improvements in Arbor Place, an adjacent apartment property nearby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3234)|
| 0:54:00| Part two is changing the names of both these apartment properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| from Town View Towers to the 1100 Studio Apartments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3243)|
| 0:54:09| changing Arbor Place Apartments to Pinnacle Park Apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3249)|
| 0:54:14| Number three, to complete this rebranding and renaming and re-identification of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3254)|
| 0:54:19| by changing the name of Town View Drive, the road which circumnavigates that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3259)|
| 0:54:26| from Town View Drive to Lula Powell Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| The purpose of this is to, again, do the obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| We're making a lot of capital improvements in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3273)|
| 0:54:36| We think it's essential to get the greatest advantage and improvement out of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3276)|
| 0:54:40| to build the neighborhood and attract new residents to change its identity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3280)|
| 0:54:45| In searching for the right name for this, we began by asking people to help us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3285)|
| 0:54:52| Phil went and spoke with the head of that cultural center, Rene Kessler,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3292)|
| 0:55:02| and asked if he had any idea of somebody who would be a good nominee for the name change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| She immediately gave us the name of Dr. Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3306)|
| 0:55:10| Dr. Powell was the principal at Green Magnet School when she was there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3310)|
| 0:55:14| and she felt very strongly that it should be a wonderful, wonderful name for this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3314)|
| 0:55:19| Dr. Powell is here tonight. I'd like you to stand up, if you could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3319)|
| 0:55:22| and let me tell you just a little bit about her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3322)|
| 0:55:25| She was the wife of Dr. William Powell, the Knoxville City Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3325)|
| 0:55:29| and 25 years employee of KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3329)|
| 0:55:32| As an individual, the Powells, and as a couple, have been, and Dr. Powell remains today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3332)|
| 0:55:37| well known for her generosity of service to the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3337)|
| 0:55:41| Dr. Powell still lives in downtown neighborhood of Morningside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3341)|
| 0:55:44| and we believe that she would be an eminently qualified name to be chosen to replace Town View Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3344)|
| 0:55:50| and we so submit that application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3352)|
| 0:55:54| I think we all agree with you that Dr. Powell is certainly deserving of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3354)|
| 0:55:59| and you have made an excellent choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3359)|
| 0:56:01| Thanks for being here, Dr. Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3364)|
| 0:56:05| Yes, if this passes, I would like to invite Dr. Powell to come and give remarks, if she would like to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3365)|
| 0:56:12| I don't want to put her on the spot, but since she's here tonight, it's a great honor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3372)|
| 0:56:19| If she feels like coming down, if she would like to come down and just give us a few remarks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3379)|
| 0:56:28| I think it would be excellent for her to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3388)|
| 0:56:30| Okay, while she's making her way down, let's vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3390)|
| 0:56:34| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3394)|
| 0:56:35| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3395)|
| 0:56:36| Any opposed? The ayes have it, and that passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3396)|
| 0:56:40| I look forward to hearing from Dr. Powell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3400)|
| 0:57:02| I'd like to say, first of all, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| I have been a resident of this area over 50 years, and in the same house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3425)|
| 0:57:11| and worked in the community all over Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3431)|
| 0:57:15| In the last 27 years, I worked at Green Magnet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3435)|
| 0:57:18| My family, who lives in Atlanta and Bentonville, Arkansas, are waiting to hear from me tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3438)|
| 0:57:26| They're all excited, too, along with my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3446)|
| 0:57:30| Again, this is a familiar place for me when my beloved late husband used to sit here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3450)|
| 0:57:37| and I would come with him daily to see the council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3457)|
| 0:57:42| If he was living today, he would do like I, be very happy about this, and would jump for joy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3462)|
| 0:57:49| Again, it is a delight to see you do this tonight, and again, I thank you, thank you, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3469)|
| 0:58:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3480)|
| 0:58:16| Very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3496)|
| 0:58:19| 12G is an ordinance approving the request of Lynn E. Keck for an amendment to the Northwest City Sector Plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3499)|
| 0:58:28| That was withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3508)|
| 0:58:30| You're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3510)|
| 0:58:34| 12G is an ordinance approving the request of Lynn E. Keck for an amendment to the Northwest Sector City Plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3514)|
| 0:58:41| from commercial to medium-density residential for property located on the southeast side of Hillary Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3521)|
| 0:58:47| southwest side of Bounds Road, 5th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3527)|
| 0:58:51| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3531)|
| 0:58:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3532)|
| 0:58:53| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3533)|
| 0:58:55| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3535)|
| 0:58:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3536)|
| 0:58:58| I have some serious concerns about this particular change in density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3538)|
| 0:59:05| I note that MPC has indicated that there would not be an impact on the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3545)|
| 0:59:10| I was at Norwood Elementary today, which is the school that students would attend who live in this development when it is built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3550)|
| 0:59:18| and they used their last available space today for a portable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| So in the past, when apartment complexes and so on had been built on Tillery, Merchants, and Pleasant Ridge,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3563)|
| 0:59:34| there's supposedly a negligible impact, but when the places are built and people move in, there's 100 extra kids who show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3574)|
| 0:59:42| So I'm very concerned about the impact on Norwood Elementary, Northwest Middle School,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3582)|
| 0:59:50| and also the fact that there doesn't seem to be a concern about what this does to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3590)|
| 0:59:58| Recently, the school board voted to build two new middle schools instead of an elementary school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3598)|
| 1:00:04| that would relieve overcrowding not only at Norwood but some of the others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3604)|
| 1:00:09| When a student needs some kind of intervention, whether it's a speech pathologist, a psychologist,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3609)|
| 1:00:15| or other kinds of help at Norwood Elementary, that takes place in the hallway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3615)|
| 1:00:20| because they don't even have a closet available for students to receive that counseling or guidance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3620)|
| 1:00:25| So I'm very concerned that this is going to increase a problem that we already face with Norwood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3625)|
| 1:00:33| and I will be opposing this tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3633)|
| 1:00:37| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3637)|
| 1:00:38| Councilman Della Vopi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3638)|
| 1:00:39| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3639)|
| 1:00:41| I didn't see the discussion of impact on the schools, which is usually in the MPC's staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3641)|
| 1:00:49| Perhaps Gerald Green can tell us a little bit about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3649)|
| 1:00:52| but certainly Councilwoman Palmer raises an important question of where do you put the kids that follow the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3652)|
| 1:00:58| I agree that the question is important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3658)|
| 1:01:00| This tract is 0.32 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3660)|
| 1:01:04| Given the small size of the tract, it was felt that the impact on the school of this particular rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| would not be significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3669)|
| 1:01:11| The few students who would attend that school from the development on this small tract would continue over what we assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3671)|
| 1:01:20| would attend that school over a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3680)|
| 1:01:23| They would not all be in first grade at the same time, nor would they all be in the fifth grade at the same time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3683)|
| 1:01:29| It would be a transition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3689)|
| 1:01:31| Again, given the small size of the tract, 0.32 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3691)|
| 1:01:35| we do not feel that the impact would be significant with this particular property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3695)|
| 1:01:40| Is that one-third of 12 units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| How does that translate into units?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| That would be four units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3704)|
| 1:01:46| It's a 12-unit medium-density zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3706)|
| 1:01:49| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3709)|
| 1:01:50| Four units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3710)|
| 1:01:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| Councilman Campin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3715)|
| 1:01:57| Well, I do support the rezoning, obviously, but I think it does bring up a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| The disconnect and communication with the school system in the county regarding this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3722)|
| 1:02:06| and not just for the density and impact on the school, but Norwood in general, is full of outbuildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3726)|
| 1:02:13| I think we've looked at other potential rezonings in the area that would add more density to the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3733)|
| 1:02:19| so I think it certainly merits a discussion with them about the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3739)|
| 1:02:24| I do support the rezoning, but it brings up a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3744)|
| 1:02:33| Are you Mr. Keck?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3753)|
| 1:02:34| Yes, I'm Len Keck, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| I assure you there's not going to be any kids there for the next 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3758)|
| 1:02:42| I'm going to build a home there to retire on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3762)|
| 1:02:48| Councilwoman Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3768)|
| 1:02:49| Then why do you need this rezoned to multi-whatever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3769)|
| 1:02:55| Medium-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3775)|
| 1:02:56| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3776)|
| 1:02:57| Why would it need to be rezoned?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3777)|
| 1:02:58| Why would it not just be R1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3778)|
| 1:03:00| Everything around it is R2, except for the commercial block to my west.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3780)|
| 1:03:09| So you're telling me that there won't be any students getting there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| Everything around those houses, except for one apartment building across the road and commercial behind me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3791)|
| 1:03:18| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3798)|
| 1:03:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| Sir, any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3804)|
| 1:03:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3805)|
| 1:03:26| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3806)|
| 1:03:27| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3807)|
| 1:03:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| So that's six to two, and the motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3810)|
| 1:03:36| Item 12H is an ordinance approving the request of Len E. Keck for a one-year plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3816)|
| 1:03:41| from general commercial to medium-density residential for property located on the southeast side of Hillary Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3821)|
| 1:03:47| southwest side of Bounds Road, Fifth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3831)|
| 1:03:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3832)|
| 1:03:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3833)|
| 1:03:54| We have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3834)|
| 1:03:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3835)|
| 1:03:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3836)|
| 1:03:57| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3837)|
| 1:03:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3838)|
| 1:03:59| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3839)|
| 1:04:00| Six to two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3840)|
| 1:04:06| 12I is an ordinance to rezone property located on the southeast side of Hillary Drive, southwest side of Bounds Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| from C3 District to R2 District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| Len E. Keck, applicant, Fifth District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3858)|
| 1:04:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3859)|
| 1:04:20| Mayor, if I could ask a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3860)|
| 1:04:24| Yes, Mr. Keck, I wonder if you wouldn't mind stepping up just one more second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3864)|
| 1:04:29| I'm still chewing on that answer you gave to Ms. Palmer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3869)|
| 1:04:33| It was C3, and obviously you don't want to make a commercial structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3873)|
| 1:04:37| You want to make a residential structure, and it's a single-family home you're building or something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3877)|
| 1:04:42| Yes, it will be a single-family home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3882)|
| 1:04:44| Is there any reason why you wouldn't want R1 instead of R2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| The only reason is everything else around there is R2 or office, and it's all multi-use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3888)|
| 1:04:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| But you plan to build just a house?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3901)|
| 1:05:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3903)|
| 1:05:04| Councilwoman Palmer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3904)|
| 1:05:05| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| While you're going to build a house and probably live in it for 20, 30, 40 years, the rezoning goes with the land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3906)|
| 1:05:13| And so, again, down the road, although once we rezone this to what you're requesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3913)|
| 1:05:20| that will follow long after you are not living in that house anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3920)|
| 1:05:24| Yeah, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3924)|
| 1:05:25| And that is a concern when we rezone that we need to remember that it's not the immediate positive thing with a single-family dwelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3925)|
| 1:05:33| but a long term down the road long after you're not worried about that single-family dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3933)|
| 1:05:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3941)|
| 1:05:42| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3942)|
| 1:05:43| Thank you, Mr. Keck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3943)|
| 1:05:44| If I could ask one other question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3944)|
| 1:05:45| One more question, Mr. Keck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3945)|
| 1:05:46| No, not to Mr. Keck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3946)|
| 1:05:47| Mr. Green, why didn't your staff recommend R1?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3947)|
| 1:05:51| What was the thinking just to make the map uniform?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3951)|
| 1:05:54| I mean, what are we doing here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3954)|
| 1:05:56| As Mr. Keck pointed out, the surrounding properties are R2, C3, and Office 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3956)|
| 1:06:03| To designate the small portion as R1 would have been spot zoning, which is not looked upon favorably.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3963)|
| 1:06:09| One thing that staff can do is look at this entire area as part of the one-year plan update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3969)|
| 1:06:14| and if feasible, recommend a rezoning of the larger area that would not create non-conforming uses in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3974)|

| 1:06:39| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=3999)|
| 1:06:43| Okay, so you don't look to downzone to R1 because of the surrounding properties being R2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=4003)|

| 1:06:52| That's the thinking and the fact that zoning this one property, R1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=4012)|
| 1:06:57| and a .32-acre parcel in the midst of a larger area would bring the question of spot zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil150804?start=4017)|
