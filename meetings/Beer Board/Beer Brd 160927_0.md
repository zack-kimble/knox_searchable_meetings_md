| 0:05:10| 9314 Kingston Pike, Suite 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=310)|
| 0:05:14| Okay. Sergeant Hunter. We were missing the fingerprints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=314)|
| 0:05:18| and the background checks from owners Gustin and Guttschall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=318)|
| 0:05:22| We did receive two documents today, but they're not sufficient to review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=322)|
| 0:05:26| for tonight. We'll need some additional documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=326)|
| 0:05:30| Okay. Ms. Day. We still need the certificate of zoning from NBC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=330)|
| 0:05:34| and building and fire and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=334)|

| 0:05:46| Is that documentation that we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=346)|
| 0:05:50| I spoke with Mr. Cornette. This was sent over to us by Ms. Day today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=350)|
| 0:05:54| It appears to be a background check, but there's no way to know by looking at the documents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=354)|
| 0:05:58| what agency they came with. So I spoke with Mr. Cornette and told him what we needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=358)|
| 0:06:02| for a proper criminal background check review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=362)|
| 0:06:06| Okay. Well, that being the case, we cannot approve this until we have that background check from him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=366)|
| 0:06:10| So do I have a motion to defer? Yes. I'll make a motion we defer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| to our next meeting. Second. All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=374)|
| 0:06:18| All right. So October 25th. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=378)|
| 0:06:22| Next is Pretentious Beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=382)|
| 0:06:32| Hello. Matthew Cummings, 131 South Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=392)|
| 0:06:36| Thank you. Sergeant Hunter. No record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=396)|
| 0:06:40| Ms. Day. This is the building, fire, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=400)|
| 0:06:44| Okay. Do I hear a motion? Move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=404)|
| 0:06:48| Second. All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=408)|
| 0:06:52| Well, tell us about Pretentious Beer because that is a different name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=412)|
| 0:06:56| It is. So I own the glass blowing studio down in the old city, Pretentious Glass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=416)|
| 0:07:00| And it's always been called Pretentious Beer and Glass Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=420)|
| 0:07:04| And doing the research for the beer glasses, I started home brewing and always| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=424)|
| 0:07:08| kind of had the intention of opening up a brewery and glass blowing studio| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=428)|
| 0:07:12| side by side. So you'd be able to come. As far as I know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=432)|
| 0:07:16| it's going to be the only place in the world you can come drink beer made in-house out of glasses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| made in-house and watch everything being made. That sounds like a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| Thank you. I hope it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=444)|
| 0:07:28| And the next one is also yours, and this is the manufacturing permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=448)|
| 0:07:32| On the last one, Madam Chair,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| the key is not to inhale the glass, right, when you're drinking the beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=460)|
| 0:07:48| All right. Now we're doing the manufacturing permit. Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=468)|
| 0:07:52| No record. Ms. Day. Building, fire, and health department approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| Okay. So when those are done, we'll vote on this, and then you'll be all set to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=476)|
| 0:08:00| Do I hear a motion? So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=480)|
| 0:08:04| Second. Pending. Pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=484)|
| 0:08:08| All those in favor? Aye. Okay. Thank you, and good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=488)|

| 0:10:20| Do you have to have coffee at the Roundup? Well, if you stay late enough, you can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=620)|
| 0:10:24| go over and have a little lunch and breakfast. Okay. Thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=624)|
| 0:10:28| and good luck. All right. Next is St. George Greek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| Orthodox Church for Greek Fest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| My name is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=636)|
| 0:10:40| Mike Nacios, 8105 Ainsworth Drive. I'm here for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=640)|
| 0:10:44| St. George. It's located at 4070 Kingston| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=644)|
| 0:10:48| Pike. Thank you. Sergeant Hunter. No record. This day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=648)|
| 0:10:52| File complete. Do I hear a motion? So moved. Second. And I have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=652)|
| 0:10:56| comment. Can we vote first? Yes, please. All right. All those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=656)|
| 0:11:00| in favor? Aye. Okay. Now, Vice Mayor Grieve, your comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=660)|
| 0:11:04| Thank you. I just think it's ironic that we've had two churches tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=664)|
| 0:11:08| come before us for beer permits and yet we still have a 300-foot distance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=668)|
| 0:11:12| requirement for other places to be close to a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=672)|
| 0:11:16| in order to sell beer. I just want to throw that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=676)|
| 0:11:20| Excuse me. I did and that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=680)|
| 0:11:24| I think it's kind of strange all of a sudden. You have the same recall, Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=684)|
| 0:11:28| He's really good at this. Shall we talk about some of your votes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=688)|
| 0:11:32| You know that if you want to have that reconsidered that you were on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| prevailing side, you could work with Mr. Frost to bring this back up to council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=696)|
| 0:11:40| I think it might be a good idea. Do my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=700)|
| 0:11:44| agree? No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| Councilman Pavlis. Can we go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=708)|
| 0:11:52| ahead? Did we vote? Yes, we voted. Mr. Nacios, I mean, I know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=712)|
| 0:11:56| you're probably not the spokesperson for the church, but with the event| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=716)|
| 0:12:00| coming up, if you could just kind of give us an update on the progress of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| the church. Okay. First of all, Greek Fest is this weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| I waited the last minute, unfortunately, but Greek Fest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=728)|
| 0:12:12| is this weekend. I appreciate the approval. I would be in big trouble if I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=732)|
| 0:12:16| And we're going to have Greek food,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=736)|
| 0:12:20| music, and Greek wines. Unfortunately, we're not going to be able| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=740)|
| 0:12:24| to have the church tours we typically have because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| that's part of Greek Fest is for us to share both our culture and our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=748)|
| 0:12:32| religion with the community. The church is making great progress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=752)|
| 0:12:36| However, the mosaics that needed to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=756)|
| 0:12:40| replaced that essentially go inside the church on the dome,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=760)|
| 0:12:44| et cetera, are being made in Italy, and that would take a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=764)|
| 0:12:48| and a half. We've gone about through half the year, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=768)|
| 0:12:52| I think the church should be ready maybe by the end of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| 2017 because those mosaics, I mean, the artist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=776)|
| 0:13:00| that's making the mosaics asked for a year and a half, so hopefully he can do it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=780)|
| 0:13:04| faster, but I would say at the end of the year, 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=784)|
| 0:13:08| All right. Well, good luck with the festival this year. We've been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| I think most council members have attended, and it's always a great time. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| Good luck. Thank you very much. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=796)|
| 0:13:20| All right. Next is the Taste of Vietnam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| on North Peter's Road. Okay. Sorry. Taste of Vietnam| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=804)|
| 0:13:28| on North Peter's Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| From the Taste of Vietnam, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=812)|
| 0:13:36| Taste of Viet. Did we move it to the end, which is almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=816)|
| 0:13:40| here? Do you want to make a motion? Yes, I make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| Is there a second? All those in favor? Aye. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| All right. Next is WDVX Special Events.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=828)|
| 0:13:56| Hi there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| Liz Lyons, and we are at 301 South K Street, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| Hunter. No record. Ms. Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=844)|
| 0:14:08| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=848)|
| 0:14:12| All those in favor? Aye. Now tell us what your event is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| There should actually be two. The first one's on Friday, October 21st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=856)|
| 0:14:20| and it's the WDVX Travaganza with Ray Wiley Hubbard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=860)|
| 0:14:24| and Elizabeth Cook. It's an annual fundraiser that we put on for the station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=864)|
| 0:14:28| live auction, food, drink. The second one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=868)|
| 0:14:32| is a Christmas concert with Suzy Boggess on Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=872)|
| 0:14:36| December 16th. All right. Well, good luck with all of those. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=876)|
| 0:14:40| Okay. Why don't we go through the addendum and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=880)|
| 0:14:44| the administrative hearings, see if the people have come in, because I have not noticed anyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| arrive. Okay. Weigel's No. 84 on Chapman Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=888)|
| 0:14:52| is under construction, and Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=892)|
| 0:14:56| Tavis will speak to that in a moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=896)|
| 0:15:00| They went through a very rigorous process with the state and with the city's help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=900)|
| 0:15:04| They're finally being able to do some work there. They had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=904)|
| 0:15:08| go through a remediation plan to remove some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| contaminated soil there. So they are working diligently, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=912)|
| 0:15:16| they're not anywhere near completion. So I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=916)|
| 0:15:20| recommend that we extend it another six months and then take a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=920)|
| 0:15:24| at it there. I don't know how long it takes these stores to come up, but generally it seems like they come pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| quick, so hopefully that'll be sufficient time. Are they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=928)|
| 0:15:32| still removing the contaminated soil? No, they're actually under construction now. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=932)|
| 0:15:36| Yeah, that probably will go fast. The one on Kingston Pike there at West Hills,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=936)|
| 0:15:40| once they got the ground ready, it went very, very quickly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=940)|
| 0:15:44| So it's very possible by the end of the year, but I don't want to push them either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=944)|
| 0:15:48| Yeah, let me back up on that, Councilman Delbo. I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=948)|
| 0:15:52| what they're doing construction. They haven't been up through there this week| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=952)|
| 0:15:56| or since about a week, so I'm not positive. You generally start seeing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| things come out of the dirt, but I think that's where they're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| But I'm not positive. Okay. Do I have a motion to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=964)|
| 0:16:08| extend this? We have a motion. We already made one. Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=968)|
| 0:16:12| All those in favor? Aye. All right. Thank you. And the date that we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| extending it to is six months, right? Six months, yeah. Okay. So that would put it into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=976)|
| 0:16:20| February 2017.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=980)|
| 0:16:24| If they get done sooner, can they come in and move it up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| They're all set to go when their inspections are done. Yeah, they're approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=988)|
| 0:16:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=992)|
| 0:16:36| All right. Let's go ahead and do the administrative hearings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=996)|
| 0:16:40| now. Before we get started,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1000)|
| 0:16:44| Bravo on Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1004)|
| 0:16:48| will come before the hearing officer October 25th, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1008)|
| 0:16:52| our next meeting date. If you recall, they had three violations, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1012)|
| 0:16:56| had sent them to the administrative hearing officer. Today we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1016)|
| 0:17:00| I think four, five. Okay. The first is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1020)|
| 0:17:04| the Merchant's Tobacco Store on Cedar Lane, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1024)|
| 0:17:08| this business had two citations within 17 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1028)|
| 0:17:12| Come up to the podium, please. Tell us your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1032)|
| 0:17:16| Amit Faisal, Merchant's Tobacco Store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1036)|
| 0:17:20| 107B Cedar Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1040)|
| 0:17:24| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37912. All right. And you paid your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1044)|
| 0:17:28| $500 fine. Yes, ma'am. And you sent the remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1048)|
| 0:17:32| Anybody have any questions for him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| I guess I have a question. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| Thank you, Chair. Is this three sales or two?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1060)|
| 0:17:44| It looks like one. He had the first one on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1064)|
| 0:17:48| March 21st, 2015, and then August 22nd, 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1068)|
| 0:17:52| Okay. So he's had two. He's had two. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| All right. We have options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| We can send them to the administrative hearing officer. We can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| accept his remedial plan and move forward and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1084)|
| 0:18:08| tell him we don't ever want to see him again on a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| Councilman Grieve. Michael Grieve. Could he go ahead and explain to us his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1092)|
| 0:18:16| remedial plan? I'd like to hear it verbally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1096)|
| 0:18:20| We programmed our register| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| with a new button. So any of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| salesmen want to sell a beer, they have to punch| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1108)|
| 0:18:32| the button. Without that button, nobody can sell the beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1112)|
| 0:18:36| When punch the button, it shows the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1116)|
| 0:18:40| sales date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| the date of birth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1124)|
| 0:18:48| to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1128)|
| 0:18:52| the eligible date of the date of birth. It shows there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| So this time there will be no mistake. Last time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1136)|
| 0:19:00| the guy who did the violation, he did a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1140)|
| 0:19:04| He checked the ID, but he did a mistake. Instead of beer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1144)|
| 0:19:08| date, he checked tobacco date. Because we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1148)|
| 0:19:12| write down it was very small and busy time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1152)|
| 0:19:16| He says it was, he did a mistake| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1156)|
| 0:19:20| he never did before. He don't have had any record before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| He did his first time and he was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1164)|
| 0:19:28| feel so guilty and he quit next day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1168)|
| 0:19:32| We don't have this guy anymore. And second thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1172)|
| 0:19:36| we put two signs. Instead of written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1176)|
| 0:19:40| we put a sign, beer sign with the color and tobacco| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1180)|
| 0:19:44| with the color. So even the busy time, this will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1184)|
| 0:19:48| visible, more visible. So I hope there will be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1188)|
| 0:19:52| no more mistake next time. And I was actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1192)|
| 0:19:56| out of state during that time. And the guy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1196)|
| 0:20:00| who did the violation, he| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1200)|
| 0:20:04| was helping me during my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| vacation time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1208)|
| 0:20:12| Did you have any special training with your staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1212)|
| 0:20:16| after this to make sure that they follow the procedure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| Yes. We did a special training on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| and how to handle this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| new burden. And without burden, it is strictly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1228)|
| 0:20:32| prohibited to sell any beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| So once they have to touch this button, they have to check ID first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| Okay. Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1240)|
| 0:20:44| Thoughts? Comments? A motion we accept the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1244)|
| 0:20:48| remedial plan and hope we never see him again. Is there a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1248)|
| 0:20:52| Second. Okay. So you've heard us. We want you to be successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1252)|
| 0:20:56| Whether you're in the country or not, you're responsible to be sure that there is no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1256)|
| 0:21:00| alcohol sold to minors. All right? Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1260)|
| 0:21:04| All right. Next is the Bombay Palace on Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| Is that why I have this airline reservation? That was his airline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1268)|
| 0:21:12| It's showing that he was out of the country. And that's why we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| We didn't. We didn't? No. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| If you're going to accept, you don't need to vote. We don't have to vote because we've accepted his plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| All right. Everybody happy? All right. Next is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1284)|
| 0:21:28| the Bombay Palace on Parkside Drive. Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1288)|
| 0:21:32| This is Robby Kumar. We are in 10901 Parkside Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1292)|
| 0:21:36| Suite 101. Okay. They've been cited two times in 2016.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1296)|
| 0:21:40| The first was April 22nd. The third time was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1300)|
| 0:21:44| July 21st. That was two citations within| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| three months. They had an agreed order with TABC that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| had a 10-day suspension. They paid their $500| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1312)|
| 0:21:56| fine. They submitted a remedial plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| Do you want to tell us about your plan so that this won't happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| Yes. We're very sorry. First of all, it happened for the second time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| And now I already quit, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1328)|
| 0:22:12| already fired the person who did a mistake. You know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1332)|
| 0:22:16| and we bought a scanner also. Every time somebody buy a beer, we're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| scan their ID. Okay. So I hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1340)|
| 0:22:24| next time won't be any problem. You know, ever since it happened, we are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1344)|
| 0:22:28| taking it so strictly. Okay. Continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1348)|
| 0:22:32| Do you want to send it to the administrator? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1352)|
| 0:22:36| I'm just curious of the cost of one of those scanners. What is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| The cost of the scanner. It was $700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1360)|
| 0:22:44| Are there variations of those scanners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1364)|
| 0:22:48| Yes. I actually bought from one of my friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1368)|
| 0:22:52| And it was used. He paid actually more than $700, but he gave it to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1372)|
| 0:22:56| for $700. And it's functional, I hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1376)|
| 0:23:00| Yeah, yeah. It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| Thoughts? Do you want to send it on to the administrative hearing officer? Do you want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| ask him to never come back again because of a sale to minor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1388)|
| 0:23:12| Thoughts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1392)|
| 0:23:16| You're satisfied? I think I'm satisfied with what he's got going on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1396)|
| 0:23:20| Councilman Wallace, are you satisfied? I promise I'll never come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1400)|
| 0:23:24| Okay. All right. Here we go. All right. Well, thank you, and good luck, and we don't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1404)|
| 0:23:28| see you again unless you're opening another place. Appreciate it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1408)|
| 0:23:32| All right. Next is the soccer senoritas doing business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1412)|
| 0:23:36| at Soccer Taco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1416)|
| 0:23:40| Oh, goodness, they brought Mr. Seymour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1420)|
| 0:23:44| Name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1424)|
| 0:23:48| Jaime Guzman, and address is 9 Market Square,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1428)|
| 0:23:52| Suite 101. Okay. You've been cited two times, once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| in July 23, 2015, and almost a year later| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1436)|
| 0:24:00| to the date, July 21, 2016. You entered into| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1440)|
| 0:24:04| an agreed order with TABC, and that included a 10-day suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1444)|
| 0:24:08| You have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1448)|
| 0:24:12| taken care of your business with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1452)|
| 0:24:16| Council, do you have questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| Tell me what you have done so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1460)|
| 0:24:24| we will never see you again for sales to minors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1464)|
| 0:24:28| Well, we hired a company now that calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| Global Insurance Group, and they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| do the training every month, and they're going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1476)|
| 0:24:40| check all our paperwork that we are good to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1480)|
| 0:24:44| And all the servers have to have their ABC now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1484)|
| 0:24:48| This company is going to check that everyone have the ABC, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1488)|
| 0:24:52| And we add more scanners, because last time we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1492)|
| 0:24:56| buy already the scanners, and it didn't work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1496)|
| 0:25:00| Actually, the server itself, a minor, took a shortcut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| and don't even scan the ID. We fire him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| We have that policy. We have no tolerance about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1508)|
| 0:25:12| It just was a mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| All the servers have to write| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1516)|
| 0:25:20| their birthday of the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1520)|
| 0:25:24| that want to consume alcohol, and they have to show it to the managers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1524)|
| 0:25:28| at least three times or five times a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1528)|
| 0:25:32| Now we have an app in our phones, too. Every server has it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1532)|
| 0:25:36| They call it BCS.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| We are going to pay for the data, and we're going to pay for whatever it costs them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1540)|
| 0:25:44| But it's easier for everybody now to use their smartphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1544)|
| 0:25:48| So we want that they use it for every ID that they ask for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1548)|
| 0:25:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1552)|
| 0:25:56| Just out of curiosity, if I understood you correctly, you said that the scanner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| did not properly work? No, it worked good, but he actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1560)|
| 0:26:04| didn't use it. Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1564)|
| 0:26:08| It didn't work at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| He used to go straight to the computer and actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| pour the beer and take it to him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| Do you still use the scanner as well as the app? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1580)|
| 0:26:24| All right. I would suggest that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1584)|
| 0:26:28| plan to not see you again for sales to minors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1588)|
| 0:26:32| unless we come to get tacos at Sucker Taco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1592)|
| 0:26:36| Yeah, we don't want to come back here. We will not come back here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1596)|
| 0:26:40| Okay. All right. I'll make that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1600)|
| 0:26:44| We're good, then. Thank you so much. Good luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1604)|
| 0:26:48| Next on the list is Masaki.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1608)|
| 0:26:52| And the owner of Masaki called me, and he is in Japan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1612)|
| 0:26:56| He had a family member become ill, and he had to leave the country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| And so I said, when he called, I thought| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1620)|
| 0:27:04| he was applying for a permit. He neglected to tell me it was an administrative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1624)|
| 0:27:08| hearing. So I told him we would hear it in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1628)|
| 0:27:12| So do we need a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1632)|
| 0:27:16| Is he serving in the meantime, his business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1640)|
| 0:27:24| Okay. Is there a second? Second. All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1644)|
| 0:27:28| Okay. So we'll hear them on October 25th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| Madam Chair, just for clarification, what does past no trouble| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1652)|
| 0:27:36| mean under the disposition of each one of these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1656)|
| 0:27:40| Sergeant Hunter? It's pretty much the same as dismissed, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1660)|
| 0:27:44| they'll set a period, usually three or six months, and as long as they don't incur| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| additional charges, then this is dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| So dismissed is immediate, and past no trouble is three to six months?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| Correct. Sometimes they'll say dismissed on cost or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1676)|
| 0:28:00| dismissed after a diversion, and then that just shows that it was dismissed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| after they had to meet the requirements for a period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1684)|
| 0:28:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1688)|
| 0:28:12| Next is Dazos Pizzeria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1692)|
| 0:28:16| Hello, I'm Martha Boggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1696)|
| 0:28:20| Dazos is at 710 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1700)|
| 0:28:24| You've had a citation on July 21st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1704)|
| 0:28:28| You had an agreed order with TABC for seven days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| This is your first violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1712)|
| 0:28:36| What are you doing to be sure this doesn't happen again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1716)|
| 0:28:40| Well, we posted the calendars for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1720)|
| 0:28:44| the correct date of birth. We did a training class| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1724)|
| 0:28:48| to retrain all the servers on correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1728)|
| 0:28:52| ID checks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1732)|
| 0:28:56| and we did a comprehensive follow-up with both the Dazos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1736)|
| 0:29:00| and the Bistro employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| Thank you. Are we ready to accept this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| We would hope to not see you again unless you're getting a permit for another location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| Now let's go back to the people who were previously not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| I believe the Taste of Viet would be the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| Come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1764)|
| 0:29:28| Do I have a motion to move that, defer that to October 25th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| Is this the first time it's been on our agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| I think so. Yeah, I'll make the motion that we defer it to the next date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1780)|
| 0:29:44| I think there was one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1784)|
| 0:29:48| To vote on the deferral. All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1792)|
| 0:29:56| The other one was Sarah 2 LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| Is there anyone here from Sarah 2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1800)|
| 0:30:04| Do we have a motion to defer that to October 25th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1804)|
| 0:30:08| So moved. All those in favor? Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1808)|
| 0:30:12| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1812)|
| 0:30:16| Do we have any questions about anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| Mr. Fairgrief, you have a very legitimate point, and if you want to have that reconsidered, as I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1820)|
| 0:30:26| you were on the prevailing side, and you can have at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| Okay. Mr. Frost? Talk with Mr. Frost about it, and he'll guide you correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| Okay. I'd like for Mr. Frost to prepare whatever is necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1834)|
| 0:30:38| Not let churches have permits?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1838)|
| 0:30:42| Absolutely. No house of the Lord should have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1842)|
| 0:30:46| I'll kind of go back to kind of what Nick was saying about the scanner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1846)|
| 0:30:52| For people, I mean, do you use, I don't know if we can talk about this now, but I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| do you see a discussion coming that to put extra restrictions on people that maybe don't have a scanner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1856)|
| 0:31:02| or don't have, you know, to require that at any time? Do you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| Well, I mean, that's one of the reasons I asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| I want to know what the price range was, and I'm sure it's probably vast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1872)|
| 0:31:18| but to me, I mean, it's easy for me to spend their money, but it seems like it's a no-brainer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1878)|
| 0:31:24| And I'm assuming if he bought one secondhand, it's $700.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1884)|
| 0:31:27| I want to say they're around $2,000, I think, because we've asked that before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1887)|
| 0:31:33| Right. I will check into it and e-mail everyone what the range of the prices on the scanner is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1893)|
| 0:31:41| And they mentioned something about an app, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1901)|
| 0:31:44| So there's some other alternatives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1904)|
| 0:31:46| Maybe we could come up with some alternatives to come back and say, you know, this is what we require.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1906)|
| 0:31:55| And I know technology keeps changing so fast that you require a scanner today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1915)|
| 0:32:00| and it will be some other gidget tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1920)|
| 0:32:02| Well, it could be scanner or better or equivalent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| I think that it would be the best for on-premise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1925)|
| 0:32:08| I just think we ought to have a discussion, maybe come up with something like that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1928)|
| 0:32:11| and make that a requirement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1931)|
| 0:32:13| I mean, we've got a slew of them coming, as you so noted, and Sergeant Hunter sent that out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1933)|
| 0:32:18| I mean, it's a slew of them that are coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1938)|
| 0:32:20| and this seems like to me we ought to kind of pare this down a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1940)|
| 0:32:25| Is that the thing on the back we're talking about, the scan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1945)|
| 0:32:28| I've never seen one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1948)|
| 0:32:30| The data?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1950)|
| 0:32:31| I think it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| It's on the driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| Right, this is my driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1953)|
| 0:32:35| On the back there's a coding substance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1955)|
| 0:32:40| More than likely that's what's being scanned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| I'm not sure if it's the top one or the bottom one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| Right, one of those two is a barcode type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| What?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| There's two of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1970)|
| 0:32:51| Sergeant Hunter, do you see a preferred appliance out there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1971)|
| 0:32:57| No, I haven't really looked into the scanners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1977)|
| 0:33:02| or paid attention to who uses what brand or what's actually out there available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1982)|
| 0:33:08| With the recent violations we've seen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1988)|
| 0:33:12| the prevailing problem seems to be that people are going through the motions to check the ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1992)|
| 0:33:16| but they're not actually checking the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| We always try to point out when there is a violation that if they look at the Tennessee driver's license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=1998)|
| 0:33:25| if they're under 21, there's a red box around the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2005)|
| 0:33:28| Because a lot of times we get the, oh, I did the math wrong or we were too busy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2008)|
| 0:33:31| so I couldn't do the math that fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| Well, when there's a red picture around the under 21 ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2013)|
| 0:33:35| if you turn it to the side it actually gives the month, date, and the year that person turns 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2015)|
| 0:33:39| And that's always discussed in our test class every Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2019)|
| 0:33:43| So it's made real easy, you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| Yes, they don't have to do any math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| They just look at the date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2027)|
| 0:33:48| The informant ABC was using on the last couple of scenes, she's 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2028)|
| 0:33:52| So it's not like she's going to be 21 in a couple of months and those people were tricked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2032)|
| 0:33:57| You know, if they would have looked at the date, she didn't turn 21 until 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2037)|
| 0:34:02| Could they, if they had a scanner, could they game it by borrowing someone's license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2042)|
| 0:34:08| and you scan the back and it's Freddie Joe and not the person that's there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| Well, on the convenience stores that actually use the scanner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| they require the person who's purchasing to hand over the license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2057)|
| 0:34:21| and the person, the employee at the store actually scans it themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| So it's up to them, to the employee, to check the ID| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2064)|
| 0:34:27| and make sure that the ID that they were handed belongs to the person that presented it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2067)|
| 0:34:30| The person that's there, check the picture and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2070)|
| 0:34:32| Sometimes people don't even look at the picture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2072)|
| 0:34:34| So scanners are really good for convenience stores| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2074)|
| 0:34:36| where they walk up and create a restaurant to be another application of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2076)|
| 0:34:41| Some of the restaurants use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| If I'm not mistaken, after the initial violations at Twin Peaks, they purchased scanners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2082)|
| 0:34:48| and they require all of their server staff to use them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2088)|
| 0:34:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2093)|
| 0:34:54| I think it's probably worth a discussion somehow or some way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2094)|
| 0:34:58| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2098)|
| 0:35:00| Mr. Frost, you found something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2101)|
| 0:35:02| I actually pulled up in the app store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2102)|
| 0:35:05| There's a Bar Club Stats ID scanner, which is just for what we're discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2105)|
| 0:35:12| So it's in the iTunes store, so obviously, or possibly it would be in the Google store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2112)|
| 0:35:19| where employers could get the app and then have their employees download it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2119)|
| 0:35:26| I didn't check to see how much it cost or anything, though, but it is available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2126)|
| 0:35:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| Counsel and panelists?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2134)|
| 0:35:37| I just had a follow-up with Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2137)|
| 0:35:39| So you're saying that from what our officers in the field are saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2139)|
| 0:35:44| is that they're just looking at the ID and they're not really looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2144)|
| 0:35:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2148)|
| 0:35:49| So it's not so much a math problem, it's just they're not even taking the step to look at the number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2149)|
| 0:35:55| That's what it looks like to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2155)|
| 0:35:57| Every time when we have a violation, we go in there and we talk to the officer or agent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2157)|
| 0:36:01| and the informant that went in there and they tell us what happened, how the person checked the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2161)|
| 0:36:05| And then we actually ask the person who violated what they did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2165)|
| 0:36:10| That last, the Chapman Highway compliance checks that we did where we had so many violators,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2170)|
| 0:36:17| we had all kinds of excuses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2177)|
| 0:36:19| I didn't have my reading glasses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2179)|
| 0:36:20| I couldn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2180)|
| 0:36:22| Oh, that person was born in 88.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| I know it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2183)|
| 0:36:24| I saw the date of birth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2184)|
| 0:36:26| I don't know if they're looking at it wrong, but it just seems to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2186)|
| 0:36:28| especially with the number of violations we had and how much it's increased here lately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| they're just going through the motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2192)|
| 0:36:34| And even some of the violations occur to places that weren't even busy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2194)|
| 0:36:38| but they're just perfunctory glances, it seems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2198)|
| 0:36:41| rather than actually checking the ID and doing the math.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2201)|
| 0:36:44| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2204)|
| 0:36:45| I mean, I know at Kroger, you hand them the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2205)|
| 0:36:47| If you hand them the ID, they punch in the number before they can do the sale, the birth date,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2207)|
| 0:36:51| and it does it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2213)|
| 0:36:54| Counsel, by fair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2214)|
| 0:36:55| I was just going to say, yeah, it's my understanding that on the license card is the red box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2219)|
| 0:37:00| And that warns people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2220)|
| 0:37:01| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2221)|
| 0:37:02| Anytime a person has a license, a tenancy license that's under 21,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2222)|
| 0:37:05| they have a red box with the date and the red box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2225)|
| 0:37:07| And you go over that at your meeting ahead of time, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2232)|
| 0:37:13| So, I mean, I don't know why we have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2233)|
| 0:37:14| George, are we going to end up standing at every restaurant to make sure they check the license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2234)|
| 0:37:20| and that sort of thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2240)|
| 0:37:21| I mean, I think it's up to the individual restaurants if they want to go to the scanner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2241)|
| 0:37:25| if they want to go to the app or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2245)|
| 0:37:27| But, I mean, it seems to me you have the tenancy license, driver's license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2247)|
| 0:37:31| and it either has the box or doesn't have the box.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2251)|
| 0:37:34| And so what more do you want to do on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2254)|
| 0:37:37| I just think we want to be careful how much we regulate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2257)|
| 0:37:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2262)|
| 0:37:45| Councilman Pavlis and then Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2265)|
| 0:37:48| Well, let me yield to Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2268)|
| 0:37:50| He may have something earth-shaking for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| He had his app out and he played with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2272)|
| 0:37:54| I unintentionally downloaded the Bar Club Scanner ID app| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2274)|
| 0:37:59| and I scanned Councilman Steyer's ID,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2279)|
| 0:38:03| and it popped up that he's 38 years old and he has a valid driver's license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2283)|
| 0:38:08| He didn't have to give his age.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2288)|
| 0:38:09| Well, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| Well, this last weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| Gone with the birthday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2291)|
| 0:38:12| These past weekend's transgressions haven't caught up to it yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2292)|
| 0:38:16| I lost that bet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2296)|
| 0:38:18| Can I get a beer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2298)|
| 0:38:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2300)|
| 0:38:21| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2301)|
| 0:38:22| I'm going to check mine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2302)|
| 0:38:23| I agree with both Vice Mayor Greave and Councilman Wallace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| I mean, Councilman Wallace has proven that he's sensitive to business and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2306)|
| 0:38:31| I don't even know that we could mandate such a move,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2311)|
| 0:38:36| but I just think it's kind of obsolete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2316)|
| 0:38:39| I think you've got to do it at the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2319)|
| 0:38:41| because I can only imagine what it was like downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2321)|
| 0:38:45| the Strip and the Bearden, all parts of Knoxville last weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2325)|
| 0:38:49| I mean, I couldn't even imagine the, I don't want to say chaos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2329)|
| 0:38:53| but the amount of business that these, thank goodness,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2333)|
| 0:38:57| for various reasons that these merchants were going under.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2337)|
| 0:39:00| So I think you control it at the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| where you've got a bartender going ten different ways at once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2343)|
| 0:39:07| and trying to swipe and do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2347)|
| 0:39:09| It's just going to continue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2349)|
| 0:39:10| It's going to be a continual problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2350)|
| 0:39:12| And then if you, you know, I saw tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2352)|
| 0:39:15| one establishment lost their beer permit or liquor, whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2355)|
| 0:39:19| what all they lost for ten days and a fine on top of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| Well, if I knew that on the front end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to get the scanner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2364)|
| 0:39:26| or I'm going to place somebody at the door and stop it coming in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2366)|
| 0:39:29| rather than us mandate, which, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| I would question that we could even mandate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2372)|
| 0:39:35| But I think it is a good discussion that we need to have moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2375)|
| 0:39:40| But if they came in with a family and there was an underage child,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2380)|
| 0:39:43| they could let everyone in with the scan at the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2383)|
| 0:39:47| but does junior get served?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2387)|
| 0:39:49| I guess it's still a question for the waiter or waitress to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2389)|
| 0:39:54| Something's got to communicate that, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2394)|
| 0:39:56| they're doing their job at the task class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| but they're still coming out when we heard a couple tonight say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| well, I did the math wrong, he was in a hurry, blah, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2402)|
| 0:40:05| And that's just, and they get off for a $500 fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2405)|
| 0:40:08| And, you know, they're breaking the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2408)|
| 0:40:10| And it's simple as that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2410)|
| 0:40:12| I mean, pro-business, but, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2412)|
| 0:40:14| they've got to be pro-business by the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2414)|
| 0:40:16| I mean, you get a flush of them coming up, you know, from the last report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| So I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2419)|
| 0:40:20| It's just certainly worthy to talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2420)|
| 0:40:23| Okay, Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| I just wanted to address the checking the ID at the door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2425)|
| 0:40:28| I didn't think about using a scanner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| brought it up, but we actually, it seems to come in waves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2431)|
| 0:40:34| We see that as an issue quite often, actually,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2434)|
| 0:40:37| that the person at the door fails to check the ID correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2437)|
| 0:40:40| And the server is relying on the person at the door,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| so they don't bother checking the ID at all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2443)|
| 0:40:45| and then they get the citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2445)|
| 0:40:47| Touche.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2447)|
| 0:40:50| And interestingly enough, that sting that we did in South Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2450)|
| 0:40:55| the convenience store that sold, I forget the name of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2455)|
| 0:40:58| but the owner checked the ID and then turned to his employee and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2458)|
| 0:41:03| yes, go ahead and make the sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2463)|
| 0:41:05| So she got the citation, even though he improperly checked the ID.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| So it's all predicated upon whoever is doing the checking to do it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| And usually at the places if we have a sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| where the ID was checked at the door and they checked it in correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2476)|
| 0:41:19| we try to press to the server that it's still incumbent upon them to check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2479)|
| 0:41:25| And one of our violators last week actually got her ABC license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2485)|
| 0:41:29| the day before the violation occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| You had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2492)|
| 0:41:34| I just had a comment about the address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2494)|
| 0:41:36| Deborah Huddleston, 4930 Lyons View Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2496)|
| 0:41:39| I'm with Metro Drug Coalition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| You all were talking about the apps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2501)|
| 0:41:43| and we met with Kim Pouncey with Top Shelf to talk about the apps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2503)|
| 0:41:47| And a lot of the apps, the people who are making fake IDs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2507)|
| 0:41:52| are figuring out the algorithms and beating them so then they can scan them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2512)|
| 0:41:56| So not all of them work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2516)|
| 0:41:58| So I don't think that that's a good recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2518)|
| 0:42:00| unless they're using a viable one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2520)|
| 0:42:02| And then also I don't know the restaurants that stated that they bought scanners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2522)|
| 0:42:06| I've never been to a restaurant where I ordered a drink that they took my ID and scanned it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2526)|
| 0:42:10| So I think that we need to remember that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2530)|
| 0:42:12| that it's more of like convenience stores would be more easy to use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2532)|
| 0:42:17| because they can scan it right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2537)|
| 0:42:19| I don't think I would be comfortable with someone taking my ID back to the register,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2539)|
| 0:42:22| scanning it, and then coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2542)|
| 0:42:23| I've never seen anyone do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| So just to remember that when you guys are having that discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| And one last thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2549)|
| 0:42:31| with so many of the people who have been cited recently that you sent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2551)|
| 0:42:35| maybe that's something that you guys need to discuss with the fines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| is raising the fines because I don't think people are taking it very seriously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2558)|
| 0:42:41| $500 is nothing for a business that makes more money in their beer sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2561)|
| 0:42:46| And then taking the 30-day suspension over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| So maybe that's something that you guys could bring up in discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2569)|
| 0:42:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2573)|
| 0:42:55| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2575)|
| 0:42:56| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2576)|
| 0:42:57| Mr. Frost, that $500 fine, I mean, we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2577)|
| 0:43:01| what is our ceiling and what's our flexibility there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2581)|
| 0:43:06| I'd have to look at that off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| I think it would be interesting to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2589)|
| 0:43:11| Knox County has $1,500 the first time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2591)|
| 0:43:15| Talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2595)|
| 0:43:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| Well, Mr. Frost, if you could look into that and get back with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2598)|
| 0:43:20| I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2600)|
| 0:43:21| Councilman De La Valle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2601)|
| 0:43:23| If you haven't already discussed this, and I don't know whether you have or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2603)|
| 0:43:27| I'm probably not alone in this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2607)|
| 0:43:29| but I received a phone call from someone who runs the standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2609)|
| 0:43:32| and was very concerned about dancing and beer and minors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2612)|
| 0:43:38| and couldn't we get rid of the rule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| And he had sort of a pecuniary interest in the answer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2620)|
| 0:43:44| but apparently it's been on the books for a while,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2624)|
| 0:43:47| and maybe Sergeant Hunter can just tell us why we have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2627)|
| 0:43:51| We didn't notice that on the agenda, but it's being discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2631)|
| 0:43:56| And we'll get back to you on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2636)|
| 0:43:59| He contacted everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2639)|
| 0:44:01| I had the sense that he was knocking on the doors trying to lobby his way into change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| He initially was going to have all of his friends write letters,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2646)|
| 0:44:09| and I said, well, why don't you talk to the council members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2649)|
| 0:44:11| to kind of get a feel for where they are on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2651)|
| 0:44:14| rather than get a lot of people involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2654)|
| 0:44:16| And so I apologize for encouraging that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| but I thought it was better than being bombarded with letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| and then maybe we do or don't want to do something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2663)|
| 0:44:25| But that is being looked into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2665)|
| 0:44:27| My only question is, it seems like the statute has a purpose,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| and I don't know that it's dissolved or gone away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| so unless I hear something different, I don't see a reason to change it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2674)|
| 0:44:40| There being no further business, let's adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd160927?start=2680)|
