| 0:02:59| Is there a motion to approve the minutes of the meeting of April 10th?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=181)|
| 0:03:02| I'll take that for a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=182)|
| 0:03:03| Any questions, corrections?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=183)|
| 0:03:04| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=184)|
| 0:03:05| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=185)|
| 0:03:06| Opposed, no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=186)|
| 0:03:07| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=187)|
| 0:03:08| Items for the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=188)|
| 0:03:09| Any items to be withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=189)|
| 0:03:10| Mr. Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=190)|
| 0:03:11| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=191)|
| 0:03:12| I think Councilmembers all have in front of them a fax from Knoxville Internal Medicine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=192)|
| 0:03:25| Consultants, PLLC, and that pertains to item 10B and its companion 11I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=205)|
| 0:03:38| What they are requesting is that their use-on-review application be withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=218)|
| 0:03:48| We have an appeal before us on the use-on-review, so I'm going to make a motion to approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=228)|
| 0:03:55| withdrawal of the use-on-review and also at the same time approve the withdrawal of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=235)|
| 0:04:07| appeal of the use-on-review because that will be moot if the use-on-review itself is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=247)|
| 0:04:14| withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=254)|
| 0:04:15| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=255)|
| 0:04:16| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=256)|
| 0:04:19| The motion is to approve the request for withdrawal of the use-on-review application and to also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=259)|
| 0:04:29| approve the withdrawal of the appeal of the use-on-review since it would no longer be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=269)|
| 0:04:36| a pertinent if we approve the withdrawal of the use-on-review application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| Would it be appropriate to just ask the reasoning behind the request for withdrawal either from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=285)|
| 0:04:51| the Mayor or you, whomever?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=291)|
| 0:04:54| The original applicants, Star Properties Management, LLC, which is representing Knoxville Internal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=294)|
| 0:05:03| Medicine Consultants, etc., they have decided not to pursue this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=303)|
| 0:05:11| And it's an appeal, so if we just withdraw the appeal, the use-on-review stands, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=311)|
| 0:05:19| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=319)|
| 0:05:20| Bingo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=320)|
| 0:05:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=321)|
| 0:05:22| That makes sense now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=322)|
| 0:05:23| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=323)|
| 0:05:24| If the motion makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| And we have a second, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=326)|
| 0:05:27| Are there any further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=327)|
| 0:05:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=328)|

| 0:10:07| Act for change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=607)|
| 0:10:09| And this is our statement to you, and also, Mr. Mayor, we would like, with your permission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=609)|
| 0:10:14| and the permission of the council, to present a green ribbon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=614)|
| 0:10:18| I have one for you, and then we have members of our organizations who would like to present| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=618)|
| 0:10:23| the green ribbon to each council member.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=623)|
| 0:10:26| And we don't have enough bowls, but various churches and places of worship have green| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=626)|
| 0:10:33| bowls, which they will put out as a symbol of the sign of life to address this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=633)|
| 0:10:38| and to promote peace and healing, not only in our city, but in our county, in our state,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=638)|
| 0:10:45| in the nation, and around the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=645)|
| 0:10:47| Hopefully, this will spread to every corner of the world.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=647)|
| 0:10:51| So, Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=651)|
| 0:10:52| I would love that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=652)|
| 0:10:53| Thank you, Doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=653)|
| 0:10:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=654)|
| 0:10:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=655)|

| 0:11:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=660)|
| 0:11:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=661)|
| 0:11:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=662)|
| 0:11:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=663)|
| 0:11:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=664)|
| 0:11:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=665)|
| 0:11:06| While they're handing that out, let me just say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=666)|
| 0:11:07| For those of you, I think most of council knows the folks that are a lot of the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=667)|
| 0:11:11| standing up before us because they're people that are active in various ways in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=671)|
| 0:11:16| And you also know, if you look around, that this is something that's reaching across racial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=676)|
| 0:11:22| boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=682)|
| 0:11:23| It's reaching across denominational and other faith boundaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=683)|
| 0:11:27| And I think that the various folks that are represented tonight speak volumes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=687)|
| 0:11:32| I have said on occasion that when people ask me, gosh, you've had a murderer here and there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=692)|
| 0:11:39| on occasion in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=699)|
| 0:11:40| Do we have a safe city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=700)|
| 0:11:41| I do think we do, relatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=701)|
| 0:11:44| But relatively doesn't matter if it's your family, if it's your child, if it's your loved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=704)|
| 0:11:48| one who's involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| And I also know this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| As a city, we have a wonderful police department, but they can't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=711)|
| 0:11:54| They can't prevent violence by themselves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=714)|
| 0:11:57| It is a community-wide effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=717)|
| 0:11:58| And that's why I was so excited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=718)|
| 0:12:00| These are folks who rose up on their own and came to us and said, we want to help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=720)|
| 0:12:04| We want to help with our congregations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=724)|
| 0:12:06| We want to help in spreading the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=726)|
| 0:12:07| And I honestly, honestly think that's how change happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=727)|
| 0:12:10| So on behalf of the city, we're proclaiming this Operation Save Our City Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=730)|
| 0:12:15| But mostly, we want to thank you as people of faith for reaching across boundaries and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| stepping up to help us change our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| And we are most appreciative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=743)|
| 0:12:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=746)|
| 0:12:27| Thank you to the council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=747)|
| 0:12:31| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=751)|
| 0:12:32| Also, very much, all of you for coming down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=752)|
| 0:12:34| I know you've been down for a while, involved in various events around downtown, and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=754)|
| 0:12:37| appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=757)|
| 0:12:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=758)|
| 0:12:39| 8A is a resolution confirming the reappointment of Stephen Noy to serve as a member of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=759)|
| 0:12:44| City Tree Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=764)|
| 0:12:45| Move approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=765)|
| 0:12:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=766)|
| 0:12:47| Any questions on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Is that a light, Joe?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=775)|
| 0:12:56| All those in favor, aye?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=778)|
| 0:12:59| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Yeah, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=780)|
| 0:13:01| I wanted to just take this opportunity to ask if the City Tree Board, if you know, if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=781)|
| 0:13:05| anybody knows if there's any meetings scheduled, if they have an agenda coming up, if they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=785)|
| 0:13:11| going to meet anytime soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=791)|
| 0:13:13| The Tree Board does meet on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| Bob Wetzel, who's the city's rep, is not here, so I can't answer specifics of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=795)|
| 0:13:20| We can get back to you on that and let you know, but they do meet on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=800)|
| 0:13:24| I've been to a couple of their meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| The reason I bring that up is because I think most of us are aware of some concerns from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=806)|
| 0:13:32| our constituents on the KUB tree-cutting programs they have, and on the way in here, I had some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=812)|
| 0:13:41| conversations about possibly a resolution encouraging KUB from council maybe to, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=821)|
| 0:13:50| it really wasn't my idea, but the possibility of having a resolution encouraging them to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=830)|
| 0:13:54| have some more communication and interaction and some strategy with constituents where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=834)|
| 0:14:01| the trees are being cut and so forth, and I just wondered if it would be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=841)|
| 0:14:06| for the City Tree Board to have some sort of interaction or discussion or some strategies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=846)|
| 0:14:11| or something with KUB, because I know they've recently hired an arborist who we know very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=851)|
| 0:14:19| well, but there's some citizens and some individuals that have really taken this on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=859)|
| 0:14:25| as a challenge to try to get KUB to think about and to work with the neighbors and property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=865)|
| 0:14:32| owners on these trees, Larry Silverstein, for one, and so I just throw that out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=872)|
| 0:14:38| wonder if there's not a possibility that we couldn't, you know, make it a better way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=878)|
| 0:14:43| We can definitely push that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=883)|
| 0:14:44| I know that KUB and the Tree Board, I know they have had conversations around that in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=884)|
| 0:14:48| the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=888)|
| 0:14:49| I don't know enough more than that to go into details, but I know that that's been a topic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=889)|
| 0:14:53| on at least two different occasions, and KUB has come and discussed their policies, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| I don't have enough in-depth knowledge beyond that, but we can definitely get somebody to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| report back to you on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=902)|
| 0:15:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=904)|
| 0:15:05| We also, by the way, we've now been in office for three and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=905)|
| 0:15:08| I've made 672 errors running these meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=908)|
| 0:15:12| Cindy just made her first by skipping over the reports of council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=912)|
| 0:15:17| So, are there any reports of council members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| I don't know that Ms. Cindy made that mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| You're chairing the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=922)|
| 0:15:23| I take care of Ms. Cindy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=923)|
| 0:15:28| Ms. Filo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=928)|
| 0:15:30| Mayor Haslam, I think it's probably more appropriate for you to make this report, but if you would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=930)|
| 0:15:36| do this on my behalf, we all, many of us just attended the Food City ribbon cutting for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=936)|
| 0:15:43| the wonderful new store at Western.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=943)|
| 0:15:46| And it was just such a wonderful occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=946)|
| 0:15:49| And I think that you probably have some comments you want to make about how successful that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=949)|
| 0:15:55| has been in taking care of some of our empowerment zone funds and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=955)|
| 0:16:00| So, I'll let you do that, because that's your success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=960)|
| 0:16:02| Well, it's actually a lot of people's success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| But, actually, the whole Mechanicsville story is a great story of city and community development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=965)|
| 0:16:09| and great planning coming together and working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=969)|
| 0:16:12| And you really have literally a transformed area of town that looks nothing like it looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=972)|
| 0:16:16| ten years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| And it's a vibrant residential community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=977)|
| 0:16:19| It's a great business community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=979)|
| 0:16:21| And it's spreading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=981)|
| 0:16:22| And that was exemplified today really by what a lot of people think maybe was kind of one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=982)|
| 0:16:26| of the last pieces of the puzzle there by opening the new grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=986)|
| 0:16:30| One thing to note, like I said, we haven't always been all that or let me say that the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=990)|
| 0:16:38| results of the empowerment zone have sometimes been questioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=998)|
| 0:16:41| And there's no question that's been fair to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| But in this case, when Food City came in, in return for the empowerment zone funding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1003)|
| 0:16:48| they got to go in that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1008)|
| 0:16:50| They promised that there would be 100 jobs in that location and that 35 of those would be empowerment zone residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1010)|
| 0:16:55| Today they announced that in opening they actually have created 180 jobs with over 100 of those being empowerment zone residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1015)|
| 0:17:02| So, that to me is just a wonderful statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1022)|
| 0:17:05| And, again, I think that whole mechanics area, every time I come over that hill, I look and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1025)|
| 0:17:10| a lot of people have done a lot of things right to make it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1030)|
| 0:17:14| And I just think, you know, publicly we need to thank Food City for the way they have really worked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1034)|
| 0:17:20| to integrate themselves into the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1040)|
| 0:17:22| And particularly it's impressed me that they have been willing to take over the old Bilo locations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| which could have left some neighborhoods with dismal situations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1048)|
| 0:17:33| And instead it's become more vibrant than ever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1053)|
| 0:17:36| And I think Steve Smith and his entire group of employees have just been incredible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1056)|
| 0:17:42| And you're right about the jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| It's just exciting because these are all local folks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1064)|
| 0:17:47| And then he mentioned the food growers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1067)|
| 0:17:51| And that was so exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1071)|
| 0:17:52| They had a little bit of food there and there were strawberries, these gorgeous, gorgeous strawberries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| They are grown just right here, just outside Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1076)|
| 0:18:00| And what was it, blackberries, he was bragging about as well, and introduced the food grower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1080)|
| 0:18:06| And he was saying that it's really their goal to use local growers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1086)|
| 0:18:10| And so they have really partnered with the East Tennessee region to try to join hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1090)|
| 0:18:16| and make us all more successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1096)|
| 0:18:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| Mr. Whitehall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| I also just want to congratulate Mechanicsville on a new grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1102)|
| 0:18:26| And I know Councilman Brown is going to just be all humble,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| but I want to thank you for your behind-the-scenes work in making that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| And it kind of speaks to what this green ribbon is all about because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1114)|
| 0:18:39| nothing stops a bullet like a job, really.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1119)|
| 0:18:43| And we need these kind of opportunities for our young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| Who's the manager at the store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1127)|
| 0:18:51| You hadn't asked me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| I could have told you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1132)|
| 0:18:53| Brewer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1133)|
| 0:18:54| Yes, Mary Brewer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Really, really sharp woman who did a great job of interviewing young people from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1136)|
| 0:19:01| and is really excited about, on some level, using this store as a ministry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1141)|
| 0:19:07| as a way to cultivate excellence in these young people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| So that's really exciting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1150)|
| 0:19:12| Second thing is this Saturday at 10 o'clock there's going to be a cleanup at Knoxville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1152)|
| 0:19:19| It's sponsored by AmeriCorps and Tribe One and Knoxville College itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1159)|
| 0:19:27| I was supposed to get a little flyer from Stan Johnson to kind of tell me more about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1167)|
| 0:19:32| but I do know it's starting at 10 o'clock,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1172)|
| 0:19:34| and if you are interested in helping out to weed eat and mow and pick up trash,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1174)|
| 0:19:41| please meet us at 10 o'clock at Knoxville College.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1181)|
| 0:19:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1184)|
| 0:19:45| Vice Mayor Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Okay, we're going to go to Councilman Becker first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1186)|
| 0:19:48| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1188)|
| 0:19:49| Two quick things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| One is just a cleanup issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1190)|
| 0:19:53| Two weeks ago was the Lonsdale cleanup,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| and I want to thank the Mayor and Councilman Grady for coming out for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| and especially all the residents of Lonsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| I think we had well over 100 people out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1201)|
| 0:20:04| Next year when it comes up, you all should come out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1204)|
| 0:20:06| It's a lot of fun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1206)|
| 0:20:07| The follow-up food music event, even in the rain, was a blast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| The folks in Lonsdale know how to have fun, and this was a great event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1212)|
| 0:20:15| It was wonderful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1215)|
| 0:20:16| It made me really proud of the city and who we've got and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1216)|
| 0:20:21| The second is, again, sort of related to community involvement and people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1221)|
| 0:20:25| I believe the budget is a really important thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1225)|
| 0:20:27| and I'm wondering if there's some minor luncheon about it this Friday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1227)|
| 0:20:30| and I wondered if the Mayor could remind people of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| Castle Park at noon, we'll be presenting the budget then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1233)|
| 0:20:36| It's right in the middle of Super 6.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| Excellent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| I just wanted to say thanks to Councilman Woodall for the kind words,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1242)|
| 0:20:45| but there are a lot of folks that played big roles in past administration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1245)|
| 0:20:51| past council, and this council in making that food city happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1251)|
| 0:20:54| And some of the other things that are coming online,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| just a little further on down Western Avenue out there in Mechanicsville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1257)|
| 0:21:00| and the neighborhood out there in Omni| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1260)|
| 0:21:02| and all those folks who live in that community who are striving to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| that Mechanicsville is the place that they want it to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1265)|
| 0:21:09| and a great place that we're already proud of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1269)|
| 0:21:12| And I want to commend this administration for going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| and continuing some of the vision of some of these development activities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| not only in Mechanicsville but other parts of this city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1280)|
| 0:21:23| And I think it's going to bode well for us as we grow as a community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1283)|
| 0:21:27| And I applaud this council for embracing development in areas like Mechanicsville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| and Vestal and Lonsdale and Five Points and Broderton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1292)|
| 0:21:35| because we've got to deal with those issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1295)|
| 0:21:37| And I'm glad to see that this council is willing to stand up to the table and do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1297)|
| 0:21:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1301)|
| 0:21:42| Councilman Hulquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| Well, we all know that the conditions are drier than normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1304)|
| 0:21:48| And, of course, we had a fire yesterday on Sharps Ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1308)|
| 0:21:51| And I just want to express appreciation to Chief Key and the Fire Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1311)|
| 0:21:56| as well as, of course, Tennessee Forestry for their fire suppression efforts on Sharps Ridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1316)|
| 0:22:00| because it could have been a lot worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1320)|
| 0:22:04| I mean, there are a lot of major television broadcast facilities up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1324)|
| 0:22:08| And it could have been much worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| I mean, it could have done a lot more damage than it did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1331)|
| 0:22:13| So I just want to express my appreciation, I'm sure, all of council, for those fire suppression efforts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1333)|
| 0:22:20| Thank you, Councilman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| They did a great job up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1341)|
| 0:22:22| It's very difficult terrain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1342)|
| 0:22:24| And they spent the day up there today also, still hitting some hot spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1344)|
| 0:22:29| But thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1351)|
| 0:22:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1352)|
| 0:22:33| Now you can go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1353)|
| 0:22:36| 9A is an ordinance amending Chapter 6 of the Knoxville City Code to add a new Article 2A,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1356)|
| 0:22:41| adopting 2006 edition of the International Residential Code, including appendices E, F, J, K, and M,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1361)|
| 0:22:47| with amendments as provided in this ordinance as the Residential Building Code of the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1367)|
| 0:22:54| Mr. Swanson, could we approve 9A, B, C, D all in one fell swoop?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1374)|
| 0:22:59| No, I'm afraid you have to do them separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1379)|
| 0:23:01| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1381)|

| 0:23:04| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1384)|
| 0:23:05| Actually, a quick question for, I guess, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1385)|
| 0:23:09| At the last meeting, you had said that there's some other codes that will be coming down to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1389)|
| 0:23:14| I had a constituent ask me about the International Energy Code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1394)|
| 0:23:17| and whether that was something we were going to be adopting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1397)|
| 0:23:21| And I should have issued this today, but I didn't think of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1401)|
| 0:23:25| That is something that we'll be evaluating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1405)|
| 0:23:27| I don't think that decision has been made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| There are some energy sections of the International Residential Code that will be a part of what we're adopting now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1409)|
| 0:23:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1414)|
| 0:23:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1415)|
| 0:23:36| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1416)|

| 0:23:42| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1422)|

| 0:27:20| There's been a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1640)|
| 0:27:23| Is there anybody lined up to speak, applicant, citizens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1643)|
| 0:27:28| No, there's not on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| Well, I think we have people on both sides that want to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1650)|
| 0:27:33| They may not have signed up, but I think the appellate or whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1653)|
| 0:27:38| the person that applied for the appeal wants to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1658)|
| 0:27:42| and I think the original applicants want to speak also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1662)|
| 0:27:44| Okay, then Ms. Leslie, would you like to come forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1664)|
| 0:27:49| and give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1669)|
| 0:27:52| Amy Leslie, 3206 Gilbert Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1672)|
| 0:27:56| Thank you for listening to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1676)|
| 0:27:58| taking into consideration this matter of the appeal that I have about the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1678)|
| 0:28:04| across the street from me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1684)|
| 0:28:07| I'm here representing my immediate neighbors who are not happy with having a house built on that program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1687)|
| 0:28:14| and also the same concern regarding the property immediately adjacent to that said property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1694)|
| 0:28:23| I ask my neighborhood association for permission to come before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| and receive that from them with their approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1708)|
| 0:28:32| And you have comments before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1712)|
| 0:28:35| If you see this, it says, to whom it may concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1715)|
| 0:28:40| These are from the two immediate neighbors that are really attached right next to the property that I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1720)|
| 0:28:51| And also on the back of that, there are petitions signed by 23 of the immediate neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1731)|
| 0:28:58| Now, that is, when I say immediate, that is within, I'd say, 300 or 400 feet of the property that is mentioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1738)|
| 0:29:08| Now, I personally am at peace with whatever you all decide on this with your recommendations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1748)|
| 0:29:16| and I'll abide by your decision, whatever it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1756)|
| 0:29:20| But I would prefer for the lots to remain as they are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1760)|
| 0:29:24| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1764)|
| 0:29:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1766)|
| 0:29:28| Is there anybody else that would like to speak in favor of the appeal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| Anyone like to speak in opposition to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1773)|
| 0:29:36| Please come forward, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1776)|
| 0:29:48| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| My name is Carter, with K-H-A-D-E-R, Sakala, S-A-K-A-L-A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1792)|
| 0:29:57| This is my wife, Melanie, and I'm representing Robert Hawes, the owner of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1797)|
| 0:30:03| And they were proposing to build a house for sale on that piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1803)|
| 0:30:10| and it's not going to be on any program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| It's just a house for sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1813)|
| 0:30:15| And we thought that this would be an easy process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1815)|
| 0:30:21| A variance is approved usually, my understanding, and it was approved in the first hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1821)|
| 0:30:27| We just don't understand why it's being objected to right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| I'd like an explanation if someone can give me why.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1831)|
| 0:30:36| I'm sorry, you'd like an explanation to what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1836)|
| 0:30:39| Why is it being disapproved or is it going to be disapproved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1839)|
| 0:30:43| or just the reason why they're objecting to it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1843)|
| 0:30:46| Well, there's an appeal, and she stated what her reasons were,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1846)|
| 0:30:50| and then counsel can decide which way that they want to go on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1854)|
| 0:30:55| And then actually you can file an appeal to court after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1855)|
| 0:30:59| Either side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Yeah, either side can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1860)|
| 0:31:01| So, Mr. Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1861)|
| 0:31:05| Can you just go over what the variance you're asking for is and why you need it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1865)|
| 0:31:11| Well, to get a permit, we have to have 25 feet sit-back from the front of the house to the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1871)|
| 0:31:20| and we only have a 50-feet wide lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1880)|
| 0:31:24| So based on that, the house that we're proposing to build is 28 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1884)|
| 0:31:30| That's why we need the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| And move it closer to the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1892)|
| 0:31:33| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| Other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| Mr. Becker, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| Well, I guess I'm going to ask a question for both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1901)|
| 0:31:45| This was decided at the BZA meeting back in October.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1905)|
| 0:31:50| What else happened since then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1910)|
| 0:31:52| Have you all been talking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1912)|
| 0:31:53| Has there been any progress?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| They asked us to give them the floor plan and elevations of the house that we're proposing to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1915)|
| 0:32:02| We gave them all the information that they asked us for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1922)|
| 0:32:05| We cooperated with the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| We communicated with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| And we thought it was resolved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1929)|
| 0:32:12| Did you ever sit down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1932)|
| 0:32:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1934)|
| 0:32:15| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1935)|
| 0:32:16| Ms. Leslie, do you want to add anything to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1936)|
| 0:32:18| I mean, conversations that have been good or bad?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| We've had very good conversations between us and no problems whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1942)|
| 0:32:28| It's just a problem of, excuse me, of I represent myself also, but I do represent the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1948)|
| 0:32:37| And that's really what I'm talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| And right now they did present plans for us where they have moved it back 12 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1961)|
| 0:32:48| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1968)|
| 0:32:49| Twelve feet from the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| But now it's only five feet from the back lot, from the back corner of the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| which would be their backyard, would only be five feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1976)|
| 0:33:00| And we just don't think that's a good plan for our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1980)|
| 0:33:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1986)|
| 0:33:07| Mr. Hultquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1987)|
| 0:33:09| Following up on Mr. Becker's question, the reason that we've had these postponements is so these conversations could take place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1989)|
| 0:33:15| And I've been party to most of those conversations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| We've met on more than one occasion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| The Sacalas and Ms. Leslie and myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2003)|
| 0:33:28| and Ms. Leslie representing not only herself but her neighbors, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2008)|
| 0:33:33| trying to see if there's a reasonable way to work through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2013)|
| 0:33:38| It's an extremely difficult lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2018)|
| 0:33:41| It's very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2021)|
| 0:33:42| It's only 50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2022)|
| 0:33:43| In reality, it fronts Gilbert, although technically the address is on price.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2023)|
| 0:33:50| And if you measure from Gilbert, the total lot depth is 50 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2030)|
| 0:33:56| There are actually two lots there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2036)|
| 0:33:58| and one of the suggestions that I made was that they combine the two lots so that they could shift any structure uphill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2038)|
| 0:34:06| so that it wasn't forced directly up against a house but was essentially straddling backyards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2046)|
| 0:34:13| and the lot line that separated those rear yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2053)|
| 0:34:17| And they said that they were not willing to combine the two lots and do a one-lot subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2057)|
| 0:34:23| So they wanted to keep the two lots separate, which means, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2063)|
| 0:34:26| that the other lot we could be dealing with the same issue in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2066)|
| 0:34:34| They have, I think, very much to the Sacalas' credit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| they have tried to work out something in terms of sort of a plan for the house itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2077)|
| 0:34:43| a house that would address the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| It's something I encouraged them to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2085)|
| 0:34:48| So originally the idea was going to be a house that sort of sat down in this hole that crowded the back lot line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2088)|
| 0:34:55| And, of course, the lot line issue doesn't change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2095)|
| 0:34:57| But they've now come up with a plan that puts a house on a basement slash garage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2097)|
| 0:35:05| so that the house is up level with more or less even with the Gilbert Avenue street level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2105)|
| 0:35:12| and fronts and presents itself to Gilbert and has a front door facing Gilbert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2112)|
| 0:35:18| So that solves that one issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| It doesn't address the issue of a crowded backyard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2124)|
| 0:35:29| Now, technically, according to, and we have Mr. Norman here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2129)|
| 0:35:36| according to our building official, and this apparently is a long-term interpretation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| when you have a corner lot you have two front yards, but you only have one rear yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2141)|
| 0:35:47| That's the interpretation of the code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| And whoever the property owner, applicant, et cetera, is gets to decide which yard is the rear,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2150)|
| 0:35:57| which side is the rear yard and which side is the side yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2157)|
| 0:36:02| And I'm not sure if that's such a great idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2162)|
| 0:36:05| In fact, this has got me thinking about doing a code clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2165)|
| 0:36:09| that says that that has to be determined that they're both rear yards unless no variance is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2169)|
| 0:36:15| because that allows for further scrutiny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2175)|
| 0:36:18| But for now, apparently, that's the way the chief building official interprets,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| is let the applicant decide which is the rear yard and which is the side yard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| The lady that lives behind this property, and I don't remember her name, but I'll. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2188)|
| 0:36:41| Ms. Collinger, an elderly lady who was not. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2201)|
| 0:36:45| I think her letter is included in the material that was provided to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2205)|
| 0:36:53| If I'm not mistaken. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| It's on top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2215)|
| 0:36:56| Okay, yeah, it's the one on top.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2216)|
| 0:36:59| She's in her 80s and didn't feel like she could make it, but she apparently objects to the crowding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2219)|
| 0:37:07| She did not make the BZA meeting and I don't think presented anything to BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2227)|
| 0:37:13| I don't know what happened in terms of communication, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2233)|
| 0:37:19| But she's the one that's most directly impacted, and she objects, I think, to this current proposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2239)|
| 0:37:29| And that's just sort of come forth recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2249)|
| 0:37:34| So it's a difficult situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2254)|
| 0:37:38| I would certainly have felt better about it if they had combined the lots, as I'd suggested,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2258)|
| 0:37:44| further up the hill so that it didn't crowd anybody's immediate, their houses, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2264)|
| 0:37:52| with a backyard facing a side yard, although technically, by current interpretation, that is allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2272)|
| 0:37:59| So it's been a tough one and it's a tough call,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| but the applicant and the neighborhood association are still appealing the variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2282)|
| 0:38:13| And, you know, I thought maybe we were going to get to a place where we could work something out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2293)|
| 0:38:19| and I think maybe the applicant thought we had worked something out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2299)|
| 0:38:24| But especially given the information from Mrs. Collinger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2304)|
| 0:38:28| and given the fact that the parties that are appealing are not comfortable with going ahead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2308)|
| 0:38:38| I feel incumbent upon me to support the appeal at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2318)|
| 0:38:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2324)|
| 0:38:48| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2328)|
| 0:38:50| There's a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2330)|
| 0:38:54| I just would like to comment that I seconded the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2334)|
| 0:38:57| Councilman Hawke was speaking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2337)|
| 0:39:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| Councilman Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| Without a variance, is it going to be possible to build on this piece of property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2347)|
| 0:39:11| I mean, I guess that's, Gary, you might know that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2351)|
| 0:39:17| Without a variance, is it going to be possible to build?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| No, I was going to ask Gary Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2360)|
| 0:39:22| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| Mark, if you can answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2364)|
| 0:39:27| Tom Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2367)|
| 0:39:29| Tom, if you can help, come on down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2369)|
| 0:39:33| Tom Reynolds, I'm building zoning plans for the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2373)|
| 0:39:38| This particular lot, I remember it coming through BZA, is a small lot of record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2378)|
| 0:39:44| which would be allowed to have different setbacks than a typical regular size lot in R1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2384)|
| 0:39:52| That means that the side yard setbacks would allow to be, one of them would allow to be five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2392)|
| 0:39:57| the other one would be allowed to be, add up to be a total of 12 on a legal lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2397)|
| 0:40:03| With the corner lot, however, the ordinance dictates that you have two front yards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| That's by ordinance, so that's the way we look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2409)|
| 0:40:12| Then we're left with two other setbacks to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| One of them is a side and one of them would be a rear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| And typically, historically, what we've done is worked with the homeowner to place a house on a lot such as this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2419)|
| 0:40:28| so that it could be built on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2428)|
| 0:40:31| Now, this particular lot was 50 foot wide, and if you looked at the property from Price and from Gilbert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2431)|
| 0:40:44| would have 25 yard setbacks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| That means if you just looked at it from Gilbert, through that part of the lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2446)|
| 0:40:55| If you have a five yard setback on the side yard, we would call a side and a 25 from Gilbert, that's 30 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2455)|
| 0:41:03| And then you would be left with 20 feet wide area to build on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| So you would have a legal area without a variance to be able to build 20 feet wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2469)|
| 0:41:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2476)|
| 0:41:17| Further questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2477)|
| 0:41:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2479)|
| 0:41:20| There's a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2480)|
| 0:41:22| You ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| Is everybody clear?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2483)|
| 0:41:25| Let me just say that there is a concern, and I've taken my position on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2485)|
| 0:41:30| but there is a concern that because we cannot prohibit double wide mobile homes that that's something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2490)|
| 0:41:38| if it was a 20 foot wide double wide, it would be able to fit on this with that interpretation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2498)|
| 0:41:47| It would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2507)|
| 0:41:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2508)|

| 0:44:13| Actually, I don't think they were all on one resolution. They are all separate resolutions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2653)|

| 0:45:38| There's not a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| Mr. Becker, go ahead if you'd like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| These are the ones, as you recall, on Dutch Valley came up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2743)|
| 0:45:46| There was some opposition in the neighborhood because the current sector plan said no commercial office development on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| north side of Dutch Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2752)|
| 0:45:55| The sector plan is currently being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2755)|
| 0:45:57| At this moment, the sector plan is allowing office development in this area with some conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2757)|
| 0:46:05| And what I'd like to do is to send 12B and 12C, and I think I can do this in one motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| to send them back to MPC to ask them to revise these, revise the approval to meet the conditions that are being developed in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2769)|
| 0:46:20| sector plan so that they'll fit with the future development we want to see happen there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2780)|
| 0:46:25| So that's a motion to move them back to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2785)|
| 0:46:28| There's a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2788)|

| 0:46:37| There are a few people who'd like to see the applicant have to apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2797)|
| 0:46:40| Actually, there are a few people who want to make sure we wait for the sector plan to be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2800)|
| 0:46:46| The sector plan right now, while it's in final form, we have to wait like a month for the printing to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2806)|
| 0:46:53| And I'd like to move the process a little quicker if we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil070424?start=2813)|
