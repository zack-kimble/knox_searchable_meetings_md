| 0:01:00| been going? We've not had any issues. The officers that worked the event didn't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=60)|
| 0:01:06| any issues. People were able to freely come and go and get from Volunteer Landing and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=66)|

| 0:02:00| DASOs on Parkside Drive, we understand this applicant wants to withdraw that application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=120)|
| 0:02:05| Yes, ma'am. All right. So moved. Second. Any discussion? All in favor say aye. Aye. Opposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=125)|

| 0:02:21| Okay. You've got another one? Yes, sir. Okay. It's not ready yet. It'll be a minute or two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=141)|
| 0:02:27| Yeah, it is. It's next. Come on back down here. Sorry about that. Just because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=147)|
| 0:02:33| pizza. Yeah. You get charged double for that. Let's try that again. Could I have your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=153)|
| 0:02:40| Gavin Lawyer, 181 Derby Run Drive, Farragut, 37934. Officer Huskey? No record. Ms. Martin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=160)|
| 0:02:48| Okay. We need a long list of stuff. Sales tax registration, corporate charter, certificate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=168)|
| 0:02:54| of zoning, approval from the building inspector, fire inspector, health department, task program| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=174)|
| 0:02:59| certification, and a final business tax return from the former owner at that site. Not that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=179)|
| 0:03:06| bad. Councilman Filo? My question is just going to be what are your plans? What is your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=186)|
| 0:03:12| schedule for opening? Hopefully the 15th. 15th of what? November. Wow. Well, you have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=192)|
| 0:03:20| a lot of work to do. I've been working every day. Are none of these? Most of them are done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=200)|
| 0:03:26| The charter is done. I took the test already. The only thing I don't have is I didn't know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=206)|
| 0:03:32| the sales tax from the previous owner. We'll help you with the details and you just need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=212)|
| 0:03:37| to bring the documentation into us. Okay. I will call everyone else and that all will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=217)|
| 0:03:41| be done hopefully by the next term. Councilman Becker? You said you did the task program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=221)|
| 0:03:47| Yes. I have the certificate right here. Is it? I'd sort of like to, Officer Huskey, do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=227)|
| 0:03:55| you know, have you seen the certificate or can you? He says he has it right there if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=235)|
| 0:03:59| you want. Why don't you bring it up here? Bring that up then. Good. That'll help. Gosh,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=239)|
| 0:04:03| why didn't he? That's it. She'll give it to one. That's good. Sir? Why don't you give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=243)|
| 0:04:20| that to Ms. Day? Councilman Pilo? Well, I guess my question would be if you have a number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=260)|
| 0:04:30| of these items taken care of, you had not shared that with the office. I went back over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=270)|
| 0:04:39| there. In fact, I talked to Wanda. Wanda was on vacation when I came back. She said I needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=279)|
| 0:04:48| to fax over my application, which I did. And then I went back to filing, which was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=288)|
| 0:04:52| last week. And I've repaid again to get the 710 Gay Street permit. And I just got this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=292)|
| 0:05:02| with all the check marks on it about three days ago. And I knew I had to get this stuff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=302)|
| 0:05:06| anyway. But I will be getting all this stuff hopefully by next time I come in here. I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=306)|
| 0:05:12| most of the stuff. I have the charter. I have the Tennessee state sales tax, but they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=312)|
| 0:05:18| all from Parkside. I already got the name change, but I'm waiting for the paperwork| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=318)|
| 0:05:24| from them. Councilman Becker? Well, it feels like Ms. Pilo, to me, of the long list of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=324)|
| 0:05:33| things, the two that were really under his control were the task program and the corporate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=333)|
| 0:05:40| charter. And he's got the task done. So it doesn't feel like he's that far behind. Most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=340)|
| 0:05:47| of what he's waiting on is stuff that the city does, the inspections, the zoning. I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=347)|
| 0:05:51| understand, but... I have the charter right here if you'd like to see it. But the inspections...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=351)|
| 0:05:57| The inspections I haven't done yet because they're not ready to be inspected. Well, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| know, I'm just talking out loud, but it doesn't appear to me that he's going to be ready to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=363)|
| 0:06:07| open by November 15th. I'll try my hardest. If I don't, then I guess it'll be the first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=367)|
| 0:06:14| of December. Councilman Frost? Thank you. I guess there's a chance he might be ready| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=374)|
| 0:06:26| to be opened by November 15th, but not ready to serve beer by November 15th. That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=386)|
| 0:06:31| Correct. I have no problem with that. Vote on this to the November beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=391)|
| 0:06:41| Second. What is the date on that? It'll be the... 18th? 18th, maybe? I'm sorry. My old| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=401)|
| 0:06:58| fashion. We meet on November the 4th. So it'll be the 18th of November. Okay. So that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=418)|
| 0:07:05| mean opening just about five days later. Councilman Bailey? Is that okay if we just wait until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=425)|
| 0:07:12| the next beer board meeting? Yeah. That'd be after your 15th. Yes. Can I still open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=432)|
| 0:07:17| up without serving alcohol? Yeah. Okay. I have a question for you now. The wine, I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=437)|
| 0:07:23| going to be a Thai restaurant also, pizzeria. Now I can't serve wine there? That's a different...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=443)|
| 0:07:29| You need an ABC license. That's the liquor license. Yes. Now if someone wanted to bring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=449)|
| 0:07:35| wine in there, can they do that or no? You can if you have the state license. Okay. Now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=455)|
| 0:07:42| also I have another question. I'm using Marsala wine and white wine in my dishes. I'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=462)|
| 0:07:51| to buy that, but I'm told that I can't do that and get exempt with my taxes. Let me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=471)|
| 0:07:58| suggest that the beer board's not really in a position to give you legal advice. Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=478)|
| 0:08:03| You should contact your attorney so that he or she can research the appropriate and applicable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| law for you. Okay? Thank you. Is there any further discussion? All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=488)|
| 0:08:17| Aye. Opposed, no. The ayes have it. Thank you. Okay. I have support for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=497)|

| 0:13:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=811)|
| 0:13:32| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| I just, Council Member Becker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=814)|
| 0:13:35| I sort of have just one legal question for, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=815)|
| 0:13:39| Council on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=819)|
| 0:13:40| This is actually zoned RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=820)|
| 0:13:42| And my recollection, with RP1, there's a certain amount of commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=822)|
| 0:13:47| that's allowed in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=827)|
| 0:13:49| And I don't know if anybody knows this well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=829)|
| 0:13:52| I didn't get to look this up beforehand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=832)|
| 0:13:54| But usually RP1 is a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| I'm a little surprised about liquor going in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| I was a little surprised about the zoning because this is Stokes Electric Company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=841)|
| 0:14:07| a motel, a landmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=847)|
| 0:14:09| Isn't that where you're located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=849)|
| 0:14:12| We are on East.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=852)|
| 0:14:13| On Peppermill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=853)|
| 0:14:14| Yeah, on East side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=854)|
| 0:14:15| On the West side of landmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| And on the East side of Stokes Electric Company and the motel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=862)|
| 0:14:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=863)|
| 0:14:24| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=864)|
| 0:14:25| We are east of I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=865)|
| 0:14:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=869)|
| 0:14:31| There is also a discount store at that other location that I was infusing you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=871)|
| 0:14:39| Discount store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=879)|
| 0:14:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=880)|
| 0:14:41| No, I didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=881)|
| 0:14:42| The back ones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=882)|
| 0:14:43| Back in the development somewhere, in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=883)|
| 0:14:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=885)|
| 0:14:46| The Mexican store back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=886)|
| 0:14:50| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=890)|
| 0:14:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=892)|
| 0:14:53| I noticed under the certificate of zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=893)|
| 0:14:56| it says a use on review for commercial retail center was approved for the subject property in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=896)|
| 0:15:03| The uses are limited to shopping center uses and include package stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=903)|
| 0:15:10| Good catch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=910)|
| 0:15:12| Interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=912)|
| 0:15:13| Thank you, Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=913)|
| 0:15:16| I'm wondering if Councilman Becker, are you still toed around your code and charter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=916)|
| 0:15:22| No, although we do have this thing that marks up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=922)|
| 0:15:26| Don't wait on me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=926)|
| 0:15:30| You want to look at zoning and I'll look up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=930)|
| 0:15:34| And would that potentially be a state regulation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=934)|
| 0:15:42| I would suggest somebody look under, you know, go to the city website, then click on MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=942)|
| 0:15:50| and then I'll take you to the city code and then go to the definitions under MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=950)|
| 0:15:56| and I'm sure package store will be defined.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=956)|
| 0:16:00| Ms. Martin, did you all look at that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| We did not look at the definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=964)|
| 0:16:05| We were just relying on the statement on the certificate of zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=965)|
| 0:16:10| When you all went to MPC, did they say anything to you about you didn't have to get a zoning change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=970)|
| 0:16:18| Never mind, you wouldn't have been to MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=978)|
| 0:16:20| Never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=980)|
| 0:16:28| The only thing I can offer with my help is that MPC issued the certificate of zoning without any advisements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=988)|
| 0:16:38| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=998)|
| 0:16:42| Let me do this, make this suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1002)|
| 0:16:45| Will you move this to the end of the agenda, the very end of the agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1005)|
| 0:16:50| because probably Mark Donaldson from MPC will get here, and if he gets here early, we might be able to ask him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1010)|
| 0:16:58| Good thinking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| How does that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| I'll second that motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1021)|
| 0:17:03| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1025)|
| 0:17:06| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1026)|
| 0:17:07| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1028)|
| 0:17:10| We have postponed you to the end of our agenda just so they can do some research.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1030)|
| 0:17:17| So hang with us a few minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1037)|
| 0:17:19| Probably be five minutes to seven or so when we deal with this one, something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1039)|
| 0:17:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1044)|
| 0:17:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| About in five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1047)|
| 0:17:28| To what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1048)|
| 0:17:30| Is it going to end up there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1050)|
| 0:17:33| It will probably be in about 30, 40 minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1053)|
| 0:17:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1058)|
| 0:17:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1059)|
| 0:17:44| Sonny Real Pitt Barbecue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1064)|
| 0:17:56| Could you give us your name and address, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1076)|
| 0:17:59| John Johnson, 7008 Pembroke Shire Lane, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1079)|
| 0:18:05| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1085)|
| 0:18:06| No affidavit of record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1086)|
| 0:18:07| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1087)|
| 0:18:08| We're waiting on a certificate of zoning approval from the building inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1088)|
| 0:18:12| task program certification, and a final business tax return from the former owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1092)|
| 0:18:17| You're missing part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| Yes, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1100)|
| 0:18:22| Is Ms. Johnson here with you tonight to address this application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1102)|
| 0:18:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1105)|
| 0:18:26| Could you come forward, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1106)|
| 0:18:30| Ms. Quinn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1110)|
| 0:18:31| They both did?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1111)|
| 0:18:34| Are you all right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1114)|
| 0:18:35| And is Ms. Quinn here tonight?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| No, she's one of the managers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1117)|
| 0:18:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1119)|
| 0:18:40| On the application, there are a number of important questions that need to be answered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1120)|
| 0:18:43| and on both Ms. Johnson and Ms. Quinn's application, under the question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1123)|
| 0:18:47| do you understand both the state laws and the local laws regulating the sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1127)|
| 0:18:52| and distribution of beer in the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| you marked no, you did not understand those laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1134)|
| 0:18:58| So is there a part about our code that you need further explanation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1138)|
| 0:19:02| or something provided to you so that you would understand how to legally sell beer in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1142)|
| 0:19:07| That was prior to her task.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1147)|
| 0:19:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1150)|
| 0:19:11| My question is can that be amended on the fly tonight on her application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1151)|
| 0:19:17| I believe it can be amended on her application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1157)|
| 0:19:19| However, on Ms. Quinn's application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1159)|
| 0:19:21| it probably might need to be approved subject to further documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1161)|
| 0:19:25| I would think we would need Ms. Quinn to indicate that she understands the laws of the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1165)|
| 0:19:31| before she is licensed as a server at this establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| So I would defer to the rest of the beer board as to how they would prefer to handle this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| since this is in Ms. Pila's district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1179)|
| 0:19:45| Well, I think we could apparently handle that by approving it pending further documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1185)|
| 0:19:52| that to include a revisit of Ms. Quinn's and Mrs. Johnson's application form.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1192)|
| 0:20:02| So that would be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1202)|
| 0:20:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1204)|
| 0:20:08| Is there any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1208)|
| 0:20:11| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1211)|
| 0:20:12| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1212)|
| 0:20:13| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1213)|
| 0:20:14| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1216)|
| 0:20:25| Sunrise Supermarket.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1225)|
| 0:20:36| Could you give us your name and address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1236)|
| 0:20:39| It's Chong-Pei Wu, 8509 Kingston Pike, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1239)|
| 0:20:46| Officer Husky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1246)|
| 0:20:49| No applicable record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| We're waiting on approval from the Building Inspector, Fire Inspector, and Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1252)|
| 0:21:01| I move approval pending further documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1261)|
| 0:21:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1265)|
| 0:21:06| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1266)|
| 0:21:09| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| I'll ask my question later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| I can ask her later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1272)|
| 0:21:14| No, I'm curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1274)|
| 0:21:15| When are you planning to open there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1275)|
| 0:21:20| November 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1280)|
| 0:21:21| November 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1281)|
| 0:21:22| This is the old CVS Drug Store at Walker Springs Shopping Center, in case any of you are interested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1282)|
| 0:21:29| So it's going to be converted into a, I guess, grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1289)|
| 0:21:33| The grocery store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1293)|
| 0:21:34| Just oriental products or Asian products?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| We'll have both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| International.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1298)|
| 0:21:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1299)|
| 0:21:40| Well, good luck there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1300)|
| 0:21:42| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1302)|
| 0:21:43| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1303)|
| 0:21:44| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1304)|

| 0:21:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1311)|
| 0:21:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1312)|
| 0:21:53| Looking at your addendum to tonight's agenda, presenting to you tonight for the first time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1313)|
| 0:22:00| on Jackson Avenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1320)|
| 0:22:03| They have completed the requirements, and we have released that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1323)|
| 0:22:08| Sometimes that happens between when we start this and when we get here at the board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1328)|
| 0:22:15| Great Wraps Cafe on Cumberland Avenue, and they've completed the requirements, and we've released that permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1335)|
| 0:22:24| Previously presented for board consideration, Farm at 1204 North Central Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1344)|
| 0:22:30| We granted extensions on July 15th, August 26th, and September 23rd, and the requirements are not complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1350)|
| 0:22:41| Councilman Farrell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1361)|
| 0:22:42| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1362)|
| 0:22:43| I was going to say, these are Daniel's shoes, and in the past he's always called me to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1363)|
| 0:22:49| if he wasn't coming here, he needed more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1369)|
| 0:22:51| I haven't heard from him this go-round.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1371)|
| 0:22:57| I know he's moving forward, and he's, you know, maybe asked to postpone this another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1377)|
| 0:23:04| to the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting, asking him to show up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1384)|
| 0:23:08| You need to give him an extension of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1388)|
| 0:23:10| Move to extend him until the next regularly scheduled beer board meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1390)|
| 0:23:16| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1397)|
| 0:23:19| That would be for both Farm and Happy Holler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1399)|
| 0:23:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1402)|
| 0:23:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1403)|

| 0:23:25| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1405)|
| 0:23:26| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1408)|
| 0:23:31| That leaves us with Mama Jan's at 35 Market Square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1411)|
| 0:23:35| We received a voicemail message yesterday saying they wished to withdraw their application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1415)|
| 0:23:43| and we've learned that the business is closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| I think if you take no action, it goes away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1426)|
| 0:23:52| Or you can withdraw it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1432)|
| 0:23:56| I didn't hear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1436)|
| 0:24:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1446)|
| 0:24:08| So are we going to go into recess now and wait until Mr. Donaldson comes along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1448)|
| 0:24:13| or has our legal minds over here found something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1453)|
| 0:24:19| I haven't found anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1459)|
| 0:24:21| I'm going to look at Mr. Holquist's computer, though, but maybe recess is a good idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1461)|
| 0:24:25| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1466)|
| 0:24:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1467)|
| 0:24:32| Need a motion to recess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1472)|
| 0:24:35| Yeah, give us a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1475)|
| 0:24:36| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1476)|
| 0:24:38| We stand in recess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1478)|
| 0:24:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| You can get all four of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1486)|
| 0:24:48| You know how to get technical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1488)|
| 0:24:56| We've got a smoke and beer discount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1496)|
| 0:24:58| Would you come back up to the microphone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1498)|
| 0:25:02| Have you great legal minds here came to any conclusions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1502)|
| 0:25:10| Yes, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1510)|
| 0:25:12| We may have discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| Oh, dear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| Where's our attorney?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| We're in trouble.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1519)|
| 0:25:20| Is there a motion on the table?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1520)|
| 0:25:22| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1522)|
| 0:25:23| There's a motion to approve and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1523)|
| 0:25:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1528)|
| 0:25:29| I made that motion in my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| And I just wanted to clarify what the issue is on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1532)|
| 0:25:40| Well, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1540)|
| 0:25:41| In the zoning certification letter we received from MPC, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| Councilman Becker pointed out that this land is zoned RP1, as parcel is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1546)|
| 0:25:50| But it says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1550)|
| 0:25:52| a use on review for a commercial retail center was approved for the subject property in 2002.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1552)|
| 0:25:58| The uses are limited to shopping center uses and include package stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1558)|
| 0:26:05| We're trying to find out what the definition of package store was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1565)|
| 0:26:08| While we were in recess, I went up to MPC and looked in every office for Mr. Donaldson to no avail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1568)|
| 0:26:19| Ms. Day or Ms. Martin, was this file complete?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1579)|
| 0:26:25| We're just waiting on the fire inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1585)|
| 0:26:30| I guess my concern is if we do something that we shouldn't have done without the opportunity to look it over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1590)|
| 0:26:38| And I certainly understand these gentlemen's situation of being in a predicament.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| I didn't know if a friendly motion to postpone for two weeks so it could be researched,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1603)|
| 0:26:51| and we have a special meeting at 655 on November the 4th would be an option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1611)|
| 0:26:57| Could I just comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1617)|
| 0:26:59| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| I just learned, I think the officer just spoke with them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| and they are making a decision on whether or not to finish out this space and locate here after they receive their beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1626)|
| 0:27:16| They have some very expensive purchases that will be necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1636)|
| 0:27:20| and in wisdom they want to get their permit before they have all their inspections except the fire inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1640)|
| 0:27:26| So I think we would have to ask them, but it seems a two-week postponement even might be a bit of a problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1646)|
| 0:27:36| How would a two-week postponement affect you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1656)|
| 0:27:39| That's fine, but we wanted to know as soon as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1659)|
| 0:27:43| We already ordered the cooler, you know, working cooler and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1663)|
| 0:27:46| I think this is their problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1666)|
| 0:27:47| It's going to take at least three weeks to come in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1667)|
| 0:27:50| And let me tell you, right next to me, building number is 4617.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1670)|
| 0:27:55| They got the liquor permit back there already, right next to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1675)|
| 0:28:00| You are saying that there is a liquor store located next door to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1680)|
| 0:28:04| Same strip mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1684)|
| 0:28:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1686)|
| 0:28:07| But what the Eason Review provided for package stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1687)|
| 0:28:11| Councilman Frost, there is the individual you were looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1691)|
| 0:28:14| Mr. Donaldson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1694)|
| 0:28:16| What do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1696)|
| 0:28:17| Just in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1697)|
| 0:28:19| Almost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1699)|
| 0:28:23| We have a beer permit, Mr. Donaldson, that is for a parcel of property that is zoned RP1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1703)|
| 0:28:32| There was a Eason Review in 2002 was granted for a commercial retail center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1712)|
| 0:28:39| and the uses were limited to shopping center uses and include package stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1719)|
| 0:28:47| We looked and we were unable to find a definition of the package stores,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1727)|
| 0:28:52| and these gentlemen are, you know, obviously wanting to get their beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1732)|
| 0:28:57| Could you help us with the zoning, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1737)|
| 0:29:02| I'll have to look and see if there is a definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| We didn't find one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| We didn't find one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1748)|
| 0:29:09| You do it for a living, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1749)|
| 0:29:12| You know, let me one of the interesting things is in the list of approved uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1752)|
| 0:29:17| there's both a liquor store and a package store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| implying that there's some difference between them, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| Well, you know, I'm just a little country girl,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1763)|
| 0:29:25| but it used to be that you talked about package stores because culturally around here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1765)|
| 0:29:31| talking about a liquor store was just kind of something you didn't talk about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1771)|
| 0:29:36| So I'm just almost going under a cultural presumption, not a legal presumption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1776)|
| 0:29:42| that it means something that is purchased and packaged in some way and taken out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| And this is an off-premise request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1788)|
| 0:29:51| So absent a definition, I guess I would almost apply my own little cultural definition to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1791)|
| 0:30:01| And I would say that's probably appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| With the lack of a definition within the zoning ordinance, we would default to a common definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| And yours is probably pretty good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| Based on that analysis, a convenience store that's selling beer would not fall under that cultural definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1817)|
| 0:30:26| of package store or that lay definition of package store?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1826)|
| 0:30:31| I would think that it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1831)|
| 0:30:32| A package store might be for the sale of liquor to be consumed off-premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1832)|
| 0:30:40| And this is beer in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1840)|
| 0:30:43| Beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1843)|
| 0:30:44| I would think it would include beer and wine even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1844)|
| 0:30:47| So you're saying in planned residential, beer sales are allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| In planned residential, you know, depending on the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| and the number of dwelling units within that development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1856)|
| 0:31:01| you can have limited commercial uses that would include beer sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1861)|
| 0:31:08| A package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| It clearly includes liquor sales.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1869)|
| 0:31:11| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1871)|
| 0:31:12| And package stores.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1872)|
| 0:31:19| From the KGIS information, it says 1.33 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1879)|
| 0:31:25| That's the parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1885)|
| 0:31:27| It's the strip mall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1887)|
| 0:31:28| I mean, this is obviously a large RP1 development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| I mean, at some level, it's not exactly on the table now, but the way the law is set up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1893)|
| 0:31:38| the allowed commercial in RP1 is the same as the allowed commercial in SC1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1898)|
| 0:31:43| and that doesn't quite seem right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| It seems like it ought to be C1 as opposed to SC1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| That's probably a long-term thing to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1909)|
| 0:31:52| But just my gut before Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| I was getting ready to say if there's both the definition of package store and liquor store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| if there's not definitions but there's a listing that says both liquor store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| and package store, to my mind, that implies liquor store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1924)|
| 0:32:07| and the kind of thing you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1927)|
| 0:32:11| But I submit that they have different sets of laws that govern them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1931)|
| 0:32:17| I mean, this city beer board hears beer permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1937)|
| 0:32:20| Beer board does not hear liquor permits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1940)|
| 0:32:22| That goes through the ABC at the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1942)|
| 0:32:26| You know, they can correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| I thought I heard that they might be able to live with a two-week postponement while it's being studied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1948)|
| 0:32:36| but it's not, you know, it's not the district I represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1956)|
| 0:32:41| Councilwoman Boehler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1961)|
| 0:32:42| I don't think I'm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1962)|
| 0:32:43| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1963)|
| 0:32:46| I don't know why I'm advocating for them, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| I really don't know how to explain that to myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1969)|
| 0:32:52| But let me say that I didn't hear you say that a two-week postponement was fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1972)|
| 0:33:01| I heard you say that you had ordered some expensive coolers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1981)|
| 0:33:05| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1985)|
| 0:33:06| And they were expensive to be delivered at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1988)|
| 0:33:09| So I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1989)|
| 0:33:11| I didn't mean to disagree with you, Councilman Frost, but I heard that a bit differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1991)|
| 0:33:16| So I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=1996)|
| 0:33:21| You know, I heard what Councilman Frost heard, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=2001)|
| 0:33:23| I heard they were going to be delivered in three weeks and that two weeks was okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| You just needed to know what so you would know how to act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| That's what I had heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=2010)|
| 0:33:31| I didn't know that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=2011)|
| 0:33:33| And so help me understand your situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| Would a two-week postponement while this issue is being researched adversely affect you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=2017)|
| 0:33:42| Would the coolers be delivered before then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=2022)|
| 0:33:44| Not before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=2024)|
| 0:33:46| Two weeks is okay, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=2026)|

| 0:33:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=2030)|
| 0:33:51| If we come back and two weeks is determined this is somehow not right, then you'll be able to deal with the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/beerbrd081021?start=2031)|
