| 3:15:55| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11755)|
| 3:15:57| I would have to imagine that for a licensed facility that the state would prohibit drug and alcohol on the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11757)|
| 3:16:05| Okay, the state would do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11765)|
| 3:16:07| Okay, then who comes in and checks to make sure that they're not bringing that in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11767)|
| 3:16:11| Do you have people regulating that inside the facility itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11771)|
| 3:16:17| Are you talking about facilities in general or the specific facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11777)|
| 3:16:21| Well, any facility that says no alcohol, no drugs, who does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11781)|
| 3:16:26| Does it outside come in every so often and check to make sure that they're holding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11786)|
| 3:16:30| that there's not any drugs sneaking in and things of that sort in those facilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11790)|
| 3:16:35| I don't know the answer to that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11795)|
| 3:16:37| How that's regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11797)|
| 3:16:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11798)|
| 3:16:39| Okay, so we don't know with these facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11799)|
| 3:16:42| It goes in here that these people will bring in some other substances and being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11802)|
| 3:16:46| We don't know how that's regulated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11806)|
| 3:16:48| Is that correct, is what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11808)|
| 3:16:52| I'm sure that there is a methodology and a mechanism for the regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11812)|
| 3:16:56| I'm not positive what it is at this point off the top of my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11816)|
| 3:17:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11820)|
| 3:17:02| Commissioner Skirmack, could I ask you a couple questions, please, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11822)|
| 3:17:06| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11826)|
| 3:17:07| Are you suggesting a different zoning class for recovery houses versus supportive housing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11827)|
| 3:17:14| No, I'm suggesting a separate ordinance, one that's tailored for the folks here in the back of the room| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11834)|
| 3:17:23| for recovery housing to duplicate what they're doing at their facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11843)|
| 3:17:27| They don't allow drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11847)|
| 3:17:28| They don't allow alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11848)|
| 3:17:31| And let them operate like they have for the past two and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11851)|
| 3:17:36| But I think if you have one catch-all ordinance, if you have one catch-all ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11856)|
| 3:17:44| I just don't think that's the way to go because that's not what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11864)|
| 3:17:48| Now, do we either want to do this right or just have one, have MPC give us one ordinance that covers a whole multitude of things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11868)|
| 3:17:57| It's y'all's districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11877)|
| 3:17:58| It's going to be your phone calls, your decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11878)|
| 3:18:01| What would you suggest would be the difference in the two ordinances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11881)|
| 3:18:05| Alcohol, drugs, yes and no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11885)|
| 3:18:10| The amendment he made would not satisfy that, that he's suggesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11890)|
| 3:18:15| Can I have, and I apologize, we talked last week at the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11895)|
| 3:18:19| Do you mind coming down to the microphone, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11899)|
| 3:18:24| Go ahead, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11904)|
| 3:18:27| You don't have to get in the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11907)|
| 3:18:29| While she's on her way down here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11909)|
| 3:18:32| I'm addressing her place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11912)|
| 3:18:36| I'll wait my turn, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11916)|
| 3:18:40| I just recognized him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11920)|
| 3:18:41| Oh, I'm sorry, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11921)|
| 3:18:47| Go ahead, Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11927)|
| 3:18:53| I think the answer, as best I can understand the concern, is what entities are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11933)|
| 3:19:07| We chose the term supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11947)|
| 3:19:11| That's a collaboration, if you will, between us and the person at MPC who wrote the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11951)|
| 3:19:21| As I understand it, Mr. Commissioner Schoonmaker would, in essence, change the term supportive housing to recovery housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11961)|
| 3:19:36| We thought that denoted things other than what we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11976)|
| 3:19:44| So the term supportive housing was what was decided upon to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11984)|
| 3:19:51| If, in fact, Commissioner Schoonmaker is concerned about somebody who wants to do something different than what we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=11991)|
| 3:20:05| then there's nothing to keep him or you or MPC from writing another ordinance to deal with some other problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12005)|
| 3:20:15| But the definition of supportive housing is precisely what we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12015)|
| 3:20:23| And that's the reason we support that particular ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12023)|
| 3:20:32| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12032)|
| 3:20:33| Holly Evans, 717 Ebenezer Road, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12033)|
| 3:20:41| I don't even understand what the question was, Mr. Schoonmaker, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12041)|
| 3:20:45| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12045)|
| 3:20:49| In our conversation this past week, you've been able to operate just the same way you always have been able to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12049)|
| 3:20:58| Nobody in Knox County, just because you're doing a rezoning, has bothered you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12058)|
| 3:21:03| Is that still correct as of this day?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12063)|
| 3:21:06| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12066)|
| 3:21:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12067)|
| 3:21:08| And when you market your services, how do you actually explain to the potential clients what you do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12068)|
| 3:21:15| I mean, the way that we do it, we are long-term recovery services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12075)|
| 3:21:20| That was the key term, recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12080)|
| 3:21:22| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12082)|
| 3:21:23| And keep going, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12083)|
| 3:21:24| You want me just to give you my sales pitch, so to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12084)|
| 3:21:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12087)|
| 3:21:28| I mean, we're a long-term recovery program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12088)|
| 3:21:30| What we do, we do not do detox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12090)|
| 3:21:32| They have to be detoxed by the time they get to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12092)|
| 3:21:34| Most have been clean, abstinent from drugs or alcohol for a given time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12094)|
| 3:21:42| You know, at least a couple weeks usually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12102)|
| 3:21:45| A lot of times longer than that, months and months, even a year into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12105)|
| 3:21:51| What we do is we get them in there, we help them find jobs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12111)|
| 3:21:57| we provide transportation to anywhere that I require them to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12117)|
| 3:22:01| We get them there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12121)|
| 3:22:04| That, for me, that cuts down on a whole lot of issues that you could have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12124)|
| 3:22:09| because they're not out walking, riding the bus, getting transportation from whoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12129)|
| 3:22:15| You know, I'm getting them where they've got to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12135)|
| 3:22:17| We only allow them to work certain hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12137)|
| 3:22:20| We only allow them to work in about a three-and-a-half mile radius.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12140)|
| 3:22:25| And aside from that, we have a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12145)|
| 3:22:29| I mean, we do several classes, groups.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12149)|
| 3:22:33| We outsource most of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12153)|
| 3:22:36| Mental health, same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12156)|
| 3:22:37| We outsource it to one of the, there's about five facilities around that we do outsource.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12157)|
| 3:22:43| And we take them to local AA, NA, Celebrate Recovery meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12163)|
| 3:22:48| Usually they get two a day of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12168)|
| 3:22:51| So we teach them how to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12171)|
| 3:22:54| That's what we try to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12174)|
| 3:22:55| We teach them how to live without using drugs or alcohol| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12175)|
| 3:22:58| because you take drugs or alcohol out of the picture,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12178)|
| 3:23:02| you've still got an addict and an alcoholic, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12182)|
| 3:23:05| They don't know how to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12185)|
| 3:23:06| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12186)|
| 3:23:07| So that's what we try to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12187)|
| 3:23:10| Number one and number two rules at my facility and most facilities of my kind,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12190)|
| 3:23:15| no drugs, no alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12195)|
| 3:23:19| Well, and as a testament, you guys had operated for almost two years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12199)|
| 3:23:24| and nobody even realized you were there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12204)|
| 3:23:26| So that's kind of a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12206)|
| 3:23:28| And that's all I'm saying is let's have an ordinance that addresses your situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12208)|
| 3:23:33| call it recovery housing, and just like you, number one and number two,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12213)|
| 3:23:38| no alcohol, no drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12218)|
| 3:23:40| To me, this is something very simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12220)|
| 3:23:42| And then you have a separate ordinance that says supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12222)|
| 3:23:46| The attorney somehow didn't catch it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12226)|
| 3:23:48| but I have never said I'm changing supportive out of I'm having two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12228)|
| 3:23:54| I'm asking for two separate ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12234)|
| 3:23:56| one that would have worked for you guys and one for the other entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12236)|
| 3:24:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12241)|
| 3:24:03| Commissioner Nystrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12243)|
| 3:24:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12247)|
| 3:24:10| Much like Commissioner Schoonmaker, when we get to a final outcome on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12250)|
| 3:24:13| I want to be clear that I don't want to see us to do anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12253)|
| 3:24:16| that will truly get in the way of stopping your business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12256)|
| 3:24:20| I'm quite familiar with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12260)|
| 3:24:21| I'm very familiar with the owner of the land that you're working with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12261)|
| 3:24:26| and I frankly would follow my sword for her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12266)|
| 3:24:29| So I'm glad to see us finally getting to some sort of resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12269)|
| 3:24:34| If it's passing this ordinance with the new language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12274)|
| 3:24:37| or passing a second ordinance that maybe changes it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12277)|
| 3:24:41| I think, John, maybe what you might be getting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12281)|
| 3:24:44| I've been involved in some things and not directly involved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12284)|
| 3:24:48| but there's the permanent supportive housing that has been used to help folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12288)|
| 3:24:52| find long-term housing, and that's kind of a different beast from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12292)|
| 3:24:57| but it uses that word that we're all getting hung up on a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12297)|
| 3:25:03| I'm just helping get that out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12303)|
| 3:25:05| So I understand where Commissioner Schoonmaker is coming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12305)|
| 3:25:07| because in some of the other language for other types of programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12307)|
| 3:25:11| that's what it's called,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12311)|
| 3:25:14| and I think that's what has caused some of the confusion on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12314)|
| 3:25:17| But either with a second ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12317)|
| 3:25:19| or I do respect and think that was a good addition on there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12319)|
| 3:25:22| because effectively that also talks to the folks with disabilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12322)|
| 3:25:27| by adding that that is applied equally across the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12327)|
| 3:25:32| as opposed to just targeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12332)|
| 3:25:34| So if that's a concern, your addition, I think, is effective in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12334)|
| 3:25:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12338)|
| 3:25:42| Did you want to comment on that, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12342)|
| 3:25:45| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12345)|
| 3:25:46| I just wanted to, again, clarify that this particular ordinance amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12346)|
| 3:25:52| does not involve in any way any issue regarding homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12352)|
| 3:25:59| or supportive housing for anything other than individuals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12359)|
| 3:26:04| who are suffering from chronic health conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12364)|
| 3:26:07| including substance abuse recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12367)|
| 3:26:10| So if the goal is to have one ordinance that addresses what we're discussing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12370)|
| 3:26:17| as supportive housing from the homeless perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12377)|
| 3:26:20| and then to have a separate ordinance that deals with the health conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12380)|
| 3:26:25| including substance abuse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12385)|
| 3:26:27| well, this ordinance only addresses that second issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12387)|
| 3:26:30| So if we think that we need two ordinances that address the two issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12390)|
| 3:26:35| well, then a separate ordinance can be enacted later on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12395)|
| 3:26:39| to address the homeless concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12399)|
| 3:26:41| but this is only addressing the substance abuse| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12401)|
| 3:26:44| and chronic health condition issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12404)|
| 3:26:47| And, you know, if we want to ensure that drugs and alcohol are not permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12407)|
| 3:26:52| at this type of facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12412)|
| 3:26:54| all we have to do is add the simple language as an additional standard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12414)|
| 3:26:59| in the supplementary regulations, as I suggested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12419)|
| 3:27:06| Commissioner Buster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12426)|
| 3:27:08| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12428)|
| 3:27:10| Mr. Schoonmaker, I've got to ask this question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12430)|
| 3:27:13| What you're talking about, and Holly, let me ask you too,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12433)|
| 3:27:17| when people get to your facility, you want to step up to the mic here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12437)|
| 3:27:21| I understand that you said they are detoxed, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12441)|
| 3:27:25| They've been at least, what, two weeks without any substances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12445)|
| 3:27:29| I mean, I'm just giving you an estimate, yeah, at least that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12449)|
| 3:27:33| So this is a different kind of supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12453)|
| 3:27:39| that you're not dealing with trying to get somebody off of drugs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12459)|
| 3:27:42| you're just trying to make them assimilate back into the regular life| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12462)|
| 3:27:48| without having some sort of substance helping you get into the life, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12468)|
| 3:27:52| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12472)|
| 3:27:53| Now, what I think John is asking about, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12473)|
| 3:27:58| if we pass this ordinance, you've got your type of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12478)|
| 3:28:03| but there's another type of housing that has to do with detoxing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12483)|
| 3:28:08| and things of that sort in another area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12488)|
| 3:28:10| but all you're talking about in your zoning is a, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12490)|
| 3:28:15| a psychological help to get them back in, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12495)|
| 3:28:19| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12499)|
| 3:28:20| And I think, John, are you talking about the two different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12500)|
| 3:28:23| like you're worried that the housing is going to bring in some people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12503)|
| 3:28:29| still using substances to deal with, is that what you're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12509)|
| 3:28:36| I'm just trying to think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12516)|
| 3:28:37| Yes, sir, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12517)|
| 3:28:41| I guess I'm having a failure to communicate properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12521)|
| 3:28:45| All I'm trying to say is what they're doing is phenomenal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12525)|
| 3:28:50| I want to protect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12530)|
| 3:28:52| I want to have an ordinance that says if they're coming near my neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12532)|
| 3:28:57| this is what exactly they're going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12537)|
| 3:29:00| because it's going to be listed as recovery housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12540)|
| 3:29:03| it will probably sail right through the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12543)|
| 3:29:06| and then you won't even have any problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12546)|
| 3:29:08| When you use a one term to cover a variety of issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12548)|
| 3:29:13| like the term supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12553)|
| 3:29:16| it just creates a nightmare for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12556)|
| 3:29:24| So why don't you propose the second ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12564)|
| 3:29:28| How many times have I asked the MPC staff if they would write that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12568)|
| 3:29:32| We've had the work session, the public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12572)|
| 3:29:35| This is the third MPC person that has come to one of those meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12575)|
| 3:29:41| but it seems to fall on deaf ears, as it is now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12581)|
| 3:29:47| Mr. Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12587)|
| 3:29:48| If I'm not mistaken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12588)|
| 3:29:49| the MPC kicked the bucket last week by saying that they went to Nashville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12589)|
| 3:29:57| and they decided that they would do this one ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12597)|
| 3:30:00| instead of breaking it down into two ordinances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12600)|
| 3:30:02| Is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12602)|
| 3:30:05| Something along that line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12605)|
| 3:30:06| That was what we were told last week by not Mr. Kelly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12606)|
| 3:30:09| but by someone else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12609)|
| 3:30:10| that today if we were to change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12610)|
| 3:30:14| and whoever came up with supportive is not a good word for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12614)|
| 3:30:19| Supportive is too broad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12619)|
| 3:30:20| They should have come up on this one as recovery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12620)|
| 3:30:24| And I know Mr. King and whoever worked real hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12624)|
| 3:30:26| have come up with the word supportive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12626)|
| 3:30:28| but it's not a good word at this point in time for this ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12628)|
| 3:30:36| Does this ordinance not also cover people who don't have substance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12636)|
| 3:30:39| and alcohol abuse problems, such as physical disabilities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12639)|
| 3:30:43| Wouldn't that be a term of supportive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12643)|
| 3:30:46| Yes, it does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12646)|
| 3:30:47| It covers both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12647)|
| 3:30:48| It covers any facility housing six or more people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12648)|
| 3:30:54| who have chronic health conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12654)|
| 3:30:56| including substance abuse problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12656)|
| 3:31:03| If the concern is worth the word supportive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12663)|
| 3:31:07| and that really seems to be the primary concern is that one term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12667)|
| 3:31:11| We've got a two-page, one-and-a-half-page amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12671)|
| 3:31:16| and the concern seems to be with the one word supportive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12676)|
| 3:31:20| I don't know if we would want to change it to group or recovery| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12680)|
| 3:31:24| or, you know, it seems like if that's truly the primary concern,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12684)|
| 3:31:29| then a name change of the definition would solve the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12689)|
| 3:31:34| without having to change the definition or the standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12694)|
| 3:31:38| Could it be supportive slash recovery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12698)|
| 3:31:41| and you had to choose which one it was when you filed your application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12701)|
| 3:31:47| We have no issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12707)|
| 3:31:50| Just as long as the definition, that is attached to the definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12710)|
| 3:31:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12714)|
| 3:31:55| Commissioner Bussard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12715)|
| 3:31:56| So a while ago you were talking about a use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12716)|
| 3:32:02| Is there something that under this category that you put use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12722)|
| 3:32:06| which would mean we categorize the people, like she's got one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12726)|
| 3:32:14| she's using a house that they're detoxed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12734)|
| 3:32:18| but then you have another supportive housing that helps them get off the drugs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12738)|
| 3:32:23| Is that under use on review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12743)|
| 3:32:25| Every facility that would come in through this definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12745)|
| 3:32:29| would qualify under this definition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12749)|
| 3:32:31| would have to go through the use on review process before it could be located anywhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12751)|
| 3:32:36| Then who defines the type of house that these people need to go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12756)|
| 3:32:42| Again, the amendment itself talks about what target population are you trying to serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12762)|
| 3:32:49| What are the treatments that are going to be provided?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12769)|
| 3:32:52| What is the program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12772)|
| 3:32:55| Who are the people?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12775)|
| 3:32:56| Where are they coming from?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12776)|
| 3:32:58| Those types of things like that are to be answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12778)|
| 3:33:02| That's information that they are supposed to be provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12782)|
| 3:33:05| And a drug and alcohol facility that's offering detox and more of a medical type facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12785)|
| 3:33:14| may or may not be located where you would want to do a facility such as they're operating right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12794)|
| 3:33:23| A larger facility that offers detox would have more of an impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12803)|
| 3:33:35| than a facility where basically what they're doing is housing and counseling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12815)|
| 3:33:40| and shepherding these people back into everyday life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12820)|
| 3:33:49| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12829)|
| 3:33:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12830)|
| 3:33:51| Can we say supportive and recovery services with a housing component?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12831)|
| 3:34:02| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12842)|
| 3:34:05| Mr. Kelly, what was the definition of supportive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12845)|
| 3:34:10| Well, supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12850)|
| 3:34:13| You can call it supportive slash recovery housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12853)|
| 3:34:16| You can call it whatever you want to call it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12856)|
| 3:34:19| as long as it means housing for six or more persons with no limit on stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12859)|
| 3:34:25| that is occupied by a target population as defined below| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12865)|
| 3:34:29| and that is linked to on and off site services, assist, supportive, that whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12869)|
| 3:34:36| You know, if you want to substitute supportive slash recovery housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12876)|
| 3:34:44| as long as you attach that definition to it, that's what it means.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12884)|
| 3:34:50| Will illegal drugs be allowed in supportive or recovery housing, either one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12890)|
| 3:34:56| The amendment that Mr. Garceau has offered would prohibit drugs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12896)|
| 3:35:07| and alcohol in facilities which are offering substance abuse treatment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12907)|
| 3:35:14| There are a lot of supportive housing type facilities, you know, HIV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12914)|
| 3:35:21| Dementia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12921)|
| 3:35:22| All these, you know, I don't know that drinking alcohol would be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12922)|
| 3:35:29| that you would think would go on with someone with dementia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12929)|
| 3:35:34| but I don't know that we would limit them to say, no, you can't have a drink.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12934)|
| 3:35:41| I know most of the assisted living facilities and nursing homes do not allow alcohol in the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12941)|
| 3:35:48| Some do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12948)|
| 3:35:49| Some have bars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12949)|
| 3:35:51| Yeah, but my question was would illegal drugs be allowed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12951)|
| 3:35:55| Illegal drugs are going to be illegal drugs whether they're allowed or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12955)|
| 3:35:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12959)|
| 3:36:00| So if the amendment said no alcohol, whether it's supportive or recovery, it's no alcohol then, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12960)|
| 3:36:10| That would be correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12970)|
| 3:36:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12971)|
| 3:36:16| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12976)|
| 3:36:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12978)|
| 3:36:21| I just did a quick Google search and just typed in the word supportive housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12981)|
| 3:36:26| First thing that pops up is a place in Commissioner Gill's district called| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12986)|
| 3:36:31| Elizabeth Holmes Traditional Supportive Housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12991)|
| 3:36:35| First line says program assists families in transition from homelessness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=12995)|
| 3:36:40| through provision of supporting housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13000)|
| 3:36:44| Do they have to have a chronic illness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13004)|
| 3:36:49| That I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13009)|
| 3:36:51| We know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13011)|
| 3:36:53| That's my point is when you hear that term supportive housing, it has another connotation to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13013)|
| 3:37:00| and that's why I'm trying to protect these folks here by having a separate entity to identify what they're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13020)|
| 3:37:06| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13026)|
| 3:37:07| If you want to change the name, that would be fine just as long as the definition that we have here goes along with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13027)|
| 3:37:17| Commissioner Nostrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13037)|
| 3:37:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13039)|
| 3:37:20| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13040)|
| 3:37:21| Let's say we change this to recovery housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13041)|
| 3:37:23| That would be a change in the name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13043)|
| 3:37:26| And if we add your addition to the ordinance, would that then apply if you have ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13046)|
| 3:37:36| I'm trying, I guess, to make this more of a rifle than a shotgun.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13056)|
| 3:37:40| If you have an HIV type of housing or, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13060)|
| 3:37:45| I've got an acquaintance that I'm a power of attorney for that's in a nursing home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13065)|
| 3:37:50| She is allowed one glass of wine a day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13070)|
| 3:37:55| So I want to quickly kind of bring this to closure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13075)|
| 3:37:58| but also avoid any unintended consequences with this bill by not accidentally going to someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13078)|
| 3:38:06| who might be an HIV supportive place or someone who is in a supportive senior type of place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13086)|
| 3:38:12| I don't want them to not be able to get a drink if that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13092)|
| 3:38:17| That seems like overstepping our bounds as a governmental entity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13097)|
| 3:38:23| I think that the language that I proposed takes into consideration that concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13103)|
| 3:38:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13110)|
| 3:38:31| So I'll read it again just so you can ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13111)|
| 3:38:33| Read it again just for clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13113)|

| 3:38:41| whose target population includes people recovering from or experiencing substance abuse problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13121)|
| 3:38:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13129)|
| 3:38:50| Commissioner Brantley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13130)|
| 3:38:51| I think that says it perfectly plain, exactly what they do, and they don't allow that in their ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13131)|
| 3:38:58| now, a nursing home, I think we're just building on this thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13138)|
| 3:39:03| You know what I mean?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13143)|
| 3:39:04| Let's just let ‑‑ let's okay this and let these folks go back and not have to come back here anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13144)|
| 3:39:11| And if we make a mistake, we'll go back and correct it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13151)|
| 3:39:14| But we're going into ‑‑ the things that I'm hearing is we're dealing into psychology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13154)|
| 3:39:19| we're dealing into all types of scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13159)|
| 3:39:22| I mean, they run an alcohol recovery unit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13162)|
| 3:39:25| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13165)|
| 3:39:27| It doesn't have anything to do with anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13167)|
| 3:39:30| Mr. Schoonmaker, the word supportive housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13170)|
| 3:39:36| is it the fear that it's going to make people think that there's transitional homeless housing coming to their neighborhood?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13176)|
| 3:39:45| Partially, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13185)|
| 3:39:47| If these folks who are doing a great job, and we know they're doing recovery housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13187)|
| 3:39:52| and they file an application with MPC and it says they're putting in a supportive housing location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13192)|
| 3:39:58| what do you think is going to be translated to the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13198)|
| 3:40:03| It's going to totally, totally ‑‑ what they're trying to do, it's going to ‑‑ never mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13203)|
| 3:40:11| I haven't heard them object to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13211)|
| 3:40:16| Well, you can't take something that's ‑‑ a duck is a duck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13216)|
| 3:40:22| I don't care where you put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13222)|
| 3:40:24| It's going to be a duck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13224)|
| 3:40:30| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13230)|
| 3:40:31| You know, every facility that ‑‑| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13231)|
| 3:40:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13233)|
| 3:40:34| And Commissioner Schoonmaker referenced the facility that is in East Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13234)|
| 3:40:40| It is right down the street from where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13240)|
| 3:40:44| The community is okay with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13244)|
| 3:40:46| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13246)|
| 3:40:47| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13247)|
| 3:40:49| This facility is less than 11 houses from where I live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13249)|
| 3:40:57| We're good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13257)|
| 3:41:02| Is there a motion on the floor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13262)|
| 3:41:03| There is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13263)|
| 3:41:05| Motion that we approve with the amendment as long as it's not a substantial change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13265)|
| 3:41:10| And with the six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13270)|

| 3:41:14| The six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13274)|
| 3:41:15| Is that going to be a substantial change, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13275)|
| 3:41:17| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13277)|
| 3:41:18| So, Mr. Garzo's amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13278)|
| 3:41:20| Has it been submitted to the clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13280)|
| 3:41:22| Have you submitted that in writing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13282)|
| 3:41:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13284)|
| 3:41:25| Mr. Sanders has it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13285)|
| 3:41:46| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13306)|
| 3:41:47| Man, I've never written a script.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13307)|
| 3:41:48| Let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13308)|
| 3:41:50| I make a motion to approve Ordinance 017A‑8102, establishing regulations for recovery housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13310)|
| 3:42:01| facilities, provided the word supportive is changed to recovery throughout the proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13321)|
| 3:42:06| ordinance, and that the definition of recovery housing in Article II, Section 2.20, is revised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13326)|
| 3:42:14| to mean housing for six persons or more instead of five‑person threshold proposed by MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13334)|
| 3:42:19| and providing that an additional standard is added to Article IV, Section 4.105, stating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13339)|
| 3:42:27| alcohol and illegal drugs shall not be permitted on the premises of any supportive housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13347)|
| 3:42:32| facility whose target population includes people who are recovering from or experiencing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13352)|
| 3:42:36| substance abuse problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13356)|
| 3:42:40| Can we talk about change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13360)|
| 3:42:42| It's good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13362)|
| 3:42:44| A second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13364)|
| 3:42:45| Right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13365)|
| 3:42:46| Go, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13366)|
| 3:42:49| We have a first and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13369)|
| 3:42:51| Mr. King.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13371)|
| 3:42:52| Point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13372)|
| 3:42:53| Daniel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13373)|
| 3:42:54| Give him the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13374)|
| 3:42:55| On a sort of a point of order interpretation, Daniel, I believe the amendment amended supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13375)|
| 3:43:06| to be recovery, and yet in the body of the amendment being read, it referred to supportive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13386)|
| 3:43:15| housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13395)|
| 3:43:16| So as long as the amendment carries through both places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13396)|
| 3:43:22| That's the way I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13402)|
| 3:43:24| I didn't mark out supportive in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13404)|
| 3:43:28| That's the way I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13408)|
| 3:43:35| We have a motion before us with a proper second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13415)|

| 3:44:49| to this, so I don't think that there's a whole lot on this one since they did have all their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13489)|
| 3:44:54| answers, all their questions answered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13494)|

| 3:45:47| was returned after the last regular stated meeting that was addressed to Travis Fuller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13547)|
| 3:46:01| as not being delivered and then I have one that was returned to me today that I had to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13561)|
| 3:46:09| go back home and pick up from the postman that was addressed to Thomas Brooks as not deliverable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13569)|
| 3:46:18| I returned both of these to the commission office to be filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13578)|
| 3:46:24| I have spoken with Mr. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13584)|
| 3:46:27| He admitted that part of this was his fault.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13587)|
| 3:46:31| He did not get the notice that that was to be picked up at the post office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13591)|
| 3:46:37| He said he probably did get the snail mail normal delivery.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13597)|
| 3:46:43| He was working under a couple of assumptions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13603)|
| 3:46:47| We set this up to try to keep developers from rolling the meeting to wear down their opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13607)|
| 3:46:54| This was a very simple zoning change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13614)|
| 3:46:59| He went to MPC, applied for a sector change in the zoning change, was put on consent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13619)|
| 3:47:08| was told that he really didn't have to be there unless somebody pulled it off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13628)|
| 3:47:14| Nobody pulled it off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170925?start=13634)|
