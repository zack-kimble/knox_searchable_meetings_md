| 2:57:50| anymore you have to figure out a way to use your property and use your land for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10670)|
| 2:57:55| what you know and that's why we're asking for this small portion to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10675)|
| 2:57:59| rezoned so that way I can use skills that I've learned over the last 10 or 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10679)|
| 2:58:03| years to host small events. Thank you I applaud you for wanting to keep the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10683)|

| 2:58:32| amendment and the reason is that the unused and blighted property from a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10712)|
| 2:58:37| previous commercial greenhouse operation warrants the reconsideration the land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10717)|
| 2:58:41| use plan to rural commercial and allow potential redevelopment. Second. We have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10721)|
| 2:58:49| motion by Commissioner Clancy a second by Commissioner Browning to adopt this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10729)|

| 2:59:30| Thank you. Thank you. We are on to agenda item number 35. This is applicant Cannon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10770)|
| 2:59:49| and Coopers LLC location southeast side of East Beaver Creek Drive east of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10789)|
| 2:59:57| Ghiradella Drive Road. Approximate size of the tract is 2.43 acres. Present zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10797)|
| 3:00:04| is a agricultural. Zoning requested is PR planned residential. Existing land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10804)|
| 3:00:11| is rural residential and the proposed use is residential subdivision. Density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10811)|
| 3:00:16| proposed is five dwelling units per acre. Staff recommendation is to recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10816)|
| 3:00:22| that County Commission approve PR planned residential zoning up to four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10822)|
| 3:00:27| dwelling units per acre. The applicant requested five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10827)|
| 3:00:31| Is the applicant present? Is there opposition? Sir do you want to go first| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10831)|
| 3:00:39| or the opposition? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10839)|
| 3:00:53| I'm Mary Sue Tovino. I live at 906 East Beaver Creek Drive 37918 and I I'm not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10853)|
| 3:01:01| really opposed to this. I just had questions as to whether when it when I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10861)|
| 3:01:06| called and asked I was told that this property could possibly be used for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10866)|
| 3:01:12| apartments condos etc but now I see that it's going to be individual houses and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10872)|
| 3:01:18| would like to ask is there a conceptual plan in place? Not yet that would come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10878)|
| 3:01:25| this is the rezoning request and the next step would be for conceptual plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10885)|
| 3:01:29| I encourage you to watch the Knox planning website and look at the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10889)|
| 3:01:35| also the applicant would be required to post a sign on the property for the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10895)|
| 3:01:40| concept plan review. Okay so the recommendation by Planning Commission it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10900)|
| 3:01:45| would be four homes per acre? That's the staff recommendation and it's up to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10905)|
| 3:01:50| Planning Commission whether they accept that or some other density and just stay| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10910)|
| 3:01:54| tuned for a few minutes and we'll all find out. Okay thank you. I might also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10914)|
| 3:01:58| recommend that you get with the applicant and let them know that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10918)|
| 3:02:02| you'd like to be notified when there is a plan ready or when it's going to come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10922)|
| 3:02:08| to Planning Commission. Okay thank you. Certainly. We actually have a concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10928)|
| 3:02:16| plan that has been submitted for the July meeting so it's available upstairs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10936)|
| 3:02:23| that you could see what has been submitted at this point in time. That'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10943)|
| 3:02:28| be before the Planning Commission right now scheduled for July. So it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10948)|
| 3:02:32| sounds like yeah we'll see you again next month. Okay sir. I'll be up higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10952)|
| 3:02:40| on the agenda next month so maybe you won't have to stay as long. Garrett| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10960)|
| 3:02:47| Tucker Robert Campbell and Associates 7523 Taggart Lane Knoxville. Yes we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10967)|
| 3:02:54| started out thinking of a condo development and so we were looking at it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10974)|
| 3:02:58| first and we inquired with MPC about the density and they indicated five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10978)|
| 3:03:05| units per acre was the most that we could get and so we dropped down and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10985)|
| 3:03:11| made it a single-family subdivision which is more compatible with what's in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10991)|
| 3:03:15| that area and with that with the density of five units per acre we're able to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=10995)|
| 3:03:20| 12 lots. We're putting a private road in with a hammerhead at the end and it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11000)|
| 3:03:28| works out a pretty nice little subdivision with 12 lots and a detention| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11008)|
| 3:03:32| pond and by going to the four units per acre we're you know we're losing three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11012)|
| 3:03:38| units which is it's kind of a waste you know with the land and we can show you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11018)|
| 3:03:43| the concept plan. I've got some copies and I'm glad to pass those out but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11023)|
| 3:03:49| think the five units per acre is very good. There's five units per acre just up the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11029)|
| 3:03:53| road at Cala Crossing. There's a piece of property the fourth or fifth one up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11033)|
| 3:03:59| across from Cala Crossing was approved at five units per acre last month so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11039)|
| 3:04:06| think the five units per acre is is reasonable and and that's what we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11046)|
| 3:04:10| like to request. Okay Commissioner Clancy. I'd like to make a motion that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11050)|
| 3:04:17| recommend the County Commission approved PR planned residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11057)|
| 3:04:21| of up to 4.5 units per acre. Second. We have a motion by Commissioner Clancy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11061)|
| 3:04:28| second by Commissioner Browning to approve planned residential. I guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11068)|
| 3:04:33| you're splitting the difference between the five and the four. Yep. Right. I don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11073)|
| 3:04:38| see any other lights on. All in favor? Aye. Any opposed? Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11078)|
| 3:04:48| We've got 36 next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11088)|
| 3:04:54| That was 35. No 36. Okay next on the agenda is item number 37. Applicant is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11094)|
| 3:05:08| Masana Investments LLC. Location is east side of Old Rutledge Pike, north side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11108)|
| 3:05:14| Mascot Road. The approximate size of the tract is 10.09 acres. The present zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11114)|
| 3:05:22| is CA general business slash A agricultural. Zoning requested is PR| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11122)|
| 3:05:28| planned residential. Existing land use is rural residential vacant. The proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11128)|
| 3:05:34| use is residential development. The density proposed is one to five dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11134)|
| 3:05:39| units per acre. The staff recommendation is to recommend that County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11139)|
| 3:05:45| approve PR planned residential zoning up to four dwelling units per acre and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11145)|
| 3:05:51| applicant had requested five. Is the applicant present? Is there opposition? Do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11151)|
| 3:05:59| not see any opposition sir. Once again your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11159)|
| 3:06:06| I'm Drew Statton again. Masana Investments PO Box 11315 Knoxville, Tennessee 37939 and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11166)|
| 3:06:13| would like to request a five dwelling units per acre given the LDR sector| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11173)|
| 3:06:18| plan goes up to five units per acre and so that is what we would prefer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11178)|
| 3:06:26| Based on that just we noticed we did notice that the adjacent subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11186)|
| 3:06:31| is roughly given the RA zoning I think it was 2.8 I believe dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11191)|
| 3:06:37| give or take and recognize that is in place but given it was developed 15 or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11197)|
| 3:06:42| 20 years ago we just don't really see the relevance there compared to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11202)|
| 3:06:46| prospective piece of property and then just a couple miles south there on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11206)|
| 3:06:50| Mascot Road more a more recent subdivision was developed there and that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11210)|
| 3:06:55| was at one to five and so it's kind of in the area that's a little farther east| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11215)|
| 3:07:01| north east anyways I'd like to ask staff to did you have anything else you wanted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11221)|
| 3:07:12| to say no ma'am okay I'd like to ask staff to respond to that request you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11232)|
| 3:07:17| know when staff did the analysis of the adjacent densities it just was not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11237)|
| 3:07:25| staff felt that the four dwelling use acres was more in context with what's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11245)|
| 3:07:28| surrounding it you know as the applicant mentioned 2.8 dwelling units per acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11248)|
| 3:07:34| adjacent to this and otherwise it's relatively lower density residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11254)|
| 3:07:40| thank you and just to add to that we realize it's less than the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11260)|
| 3:07:45| requested but it is still a jump from the character of the neighborhood so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11265)|
| 3:07:51| thought instead of a radical change a somewhat more gradual maybe still some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11271)|
| 3:07:57| I'm sure when the concept plan comes I'm surprised there's no one here now but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11277)|
| 3:08:02| concept plan comes in maybe neighbors opposed to even four units an acre but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11282)|
| 3:08:06| we feel that's a reasonable application and as I'm mr. sat and said the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11286)|
| 3:08:11| developments had been built some years ago so we are cognizant of the desire| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11291)|
| 3:08:17| for smaller lots to feel that 40 dwelling units an acre would enable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11297)|
| 3:08:21| that thank you commissioner Clancy I'd like to make a motion that we recommend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11301)|
| 3:08:28| that County Commission approved PR planned residential zoning up to four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11308)|
| 3:08:32| four dwelling units per acre second we have a motion by Commissioner Clancy a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11312)|
| 3:08:36| second by Commissioner Browning to approve the planned residential zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11316)|
| 3:08:40| commissioner a sin I have I guess I have some concerns about this one about why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11320)|
| 3:08:45| we're not going with five understand staff looking at the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11325)|
| 3:08:48| neighborhoods but but this this section road clock has utilities is that correct| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11328)|
| 3:08:55| that's correct and looking at the parcel it's not on a hillside or steep slope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11335)|
| 3:09:00| it's not heavily forested it looks like the perfect parcel for for the higher| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11340)|
| 3:09:08| density of five you make good points I won't debate you and it's a you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11348)|
| 3:09:15| it's a challenge for staff trying to enable higher density where appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11355)|
| 3:09:20| but not be too out of character with the existing neighborhoods it's just but I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11360)|
| 3:09:27| some of the same points that you made went through my head when I look at this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11367)|
| 3:09:31| so I can understand your your question your points that you may and then I have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11371)|
| 3:09:36| a question for Commissioner Clancy why you split the difference on the last one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11376)|
| 3:09:40| and not this one because this one had lower density just adjacent to it and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11380)|
| 3:09:47| know it's an older subdivision but it just seemed more appropriate to buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11387)|
| 3:09:53| you know I could support five but I just felt like with the 2.8 right next to it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11393)|
| 3:09:59| that was a that was a concession and splitting splitting the baby on that one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11399)|
| 3:10:06| so that's that's why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11406)|
| 3:10:12| okay we do have a motion on the floor by Commissioner Clancy a second by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11412)|

| 3:19:17| two issues we have if you look at handout I think it's nine and ten of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11957)|
| 3:19:24| course we we know the economic benefits to this center are significant on number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11964)|
| 3:19:30| nine but number ten we have we've worked hard with the staff we're parked with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11970)|
| 3:19:37| TDOT willing to put in the median triangle to correct that issue in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11977)|
| 3:19:44| median that's not being enforced across the street if that's ultimately what TDOT| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11984)|
| 3:19:49| wants to do but we don't feel like we need to be micromanaged so to speak on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11989)|
| 3:19:55| the Jiffy Lube access which their customers have used for 20 years or on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=11995)|
| 3:20:03| the small 2400 square foot building that the staff staff's recommending a to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12003)|
| 3:20:10| block that off there's numerous places in my developments and other you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12010)|

| 3:20:23| works fine the there but it's a right in right out we just don't see this issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12023)|
| 3:20:28| so with that said we request Planning Commission to approve our use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12028)|

| 3:22:37| and with city engineering staff to go over this stuff to look at the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12157)|
| 3:22:42| out there and we identified the basically those four intersection areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12162)|

| 3:24:04| early on with the applicant to try to address what we felt were important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12244)|
| 3:24:09| safety improvements that were needed without requiring a full traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12249)|
| 3:24:14| and evaluation and I think if a full re-evaluation was done of this site with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12254)|
| 3:24:20| a new traffic study there may even be more improvements that would be needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12260)|
| 3:24:24| as a result of that analysis so the recommendation that staff has made with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12264)|
| 3:24:30| those conditions three through seven are recommendations that were result of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12270)|
| 3:24:37| TDOT city engineering and planning staff identifying what we thought were safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12277)|
| 3:24:42| improvements the issue on the median and I'm just going to highlight just a couple| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12282)|
| 3:24:49| of those the median issue at the target entrance one of the options that TDOT is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12289)|
| 3:24:56| actually looking at is closing that median opening and that would eliminate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12296)|
| 3:25:01| any left turns out of target it would eliminate left turns into target they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12301)|
| 3:25:07| had suggested a J turn which would allow left turns in the applicant has come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12307)|
| 3:25:12| come up with this other island design which TDOT had indicated would require| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12312)|
| 3:25:18| modification to approve something similar to that it may approve extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12318)|
| 3:25:22| of the curb line in both directions at that location our condition is basically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12322)|
| 3:25:27| recommending that they work with TDOT and coming up with a final solution on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12327)|
| 3:25:32| having some restriction on access in that median just enforcing the right in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12332)|
| 3:25:39| right out island across from the target entrance on the other side of the highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12339)|
| 3:25:45| if you look at that design that was approved previously on that there's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12345)|
| 3:25:50| nothing in that design that would restrict somebody from making starting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12350)|
| 3:25:54| to make a right out to go into the median to go left and even though you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12354)|
| 3:25:59| not supposed to do that nature of people is that they will do that so TDOT is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12359)|
| 3:26:04| will be looking at revised changes and we feel that our condition on them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12364)|
| 3:26:10| working out the details with the applicant on that median design is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12370)|
| 3:26:15| appropriate way to go on the issue of access point number four in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12375)|
| 3:26:21| discussions we've had with the applicant on that our concern is the close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12381)|
| 3:26:26| proximity of that parallel driveway even though they're showing a slight left| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12386)|

| 3:26:42| tend to if they want to go out to make a right to go out they're gonna they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12402)|
| 3:26:46| not going to be restricted to do that going into the exit out of the interior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12406)|

| 3:27:03| where the references have been made to most people using the traffic light kind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12423)|
| 3:27:09| in front of GB shoes as access in and out of the center those kind of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12429)|
| 3:27:16| movements are made without these new buildings and turn lanes or drive-thru| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12436)|
| 3:27:22| lanes and stuff that changes traffic throat flow through the center so if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12442)|
| 3:27:27| still if people use the traffic light is to make access point we feel just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12447)|
| 3:27:32| closing that southern access point from that drive-thru for that 2400 square| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12452)|
| 3:27:38| foot building will eliminate that safety or conflict area so close to the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12458)|
| 3:27:43| Callahan Road entrance the other one that I think the only other one that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12463)|
| 3:27:48| had any comment about was the one between Jiffy Lube access point number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12468)|
| 3:27:54| one it was a recommendation about restricting access on to Clinton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12474)|
| 3:28:03| Highway at that point that would be right and only the alternative was to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12483)|
| 3:28:06| allow the right and right out there not to change but just have the traffic flow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12486)|
| 3:28:11| between Jiffy Lube and the target parcel be eastbound into the target to restrict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12491)|
| 3:28:17| all access going right and the concern there was that traffic flow additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12497)|
| 3:28:22| traffic flow coming out at that point people will be getting into Clinton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12502)|
| 3:28:26| Highway very close to the traffic signal and would be looking at making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12506)|
| 3:28:31| crossing three lanes to get over into the left turn lane into the Walmart side| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12511)|
| 3:28:37| being that close we weren't talking about closing that access it was still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12517)|
| 3:28:41| out to Jiffy Lube to go on to the target parcel and go through the center and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12521)|
| 3:28:46| they have to two additional access points so yeah I think we're pretty much| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12526)|
| 3:28:50| in agreement it's just you know the issues or what recommendation we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12530)|
| 3:28:54| making is in line with what the city and TDOT have had discussions with us and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12534)|
| 3:28:59| the applicant and we would recommend that and actually Dwayne Rainbows here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12539)|
| 3:29:05| from TDOT if you have any questions for them thank you that was a very thorough| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12545)|
| 3:29:13| explanation Mr. Green did you have no I was Tom beat me to it I was just going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12553)|
| 3:29:19| to note that there is a TDOT staffer here exploited patiently through the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12559)|
| 3:29:24| entire meeting so if you have questions for more detail regarding TDOT's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12564)|
| 3:29:28| concerns or recommendations you'd be happy to answer I'm sorry I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12568)|
| 3:29:35| respond to a few of Tom's comments if I can certainly thank you if you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12575)|
| 3:29:43| our handout number one it's kind of confusing because there's a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12583)|
| 3:29:47| access discussion here but I want to be sure and maybe you do and maybe I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12587)|
| 3:29:56| trying to oversimplify it but when we were first presented with the Jiffy Lube| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12596)|
| 3:30:05| closing they're closing Jiffy Lube access the course TDOT's I believe I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12605)|
| 3:30:12| not trying to put any words in Dwayne's mouth but really didn't like the access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12612)|
| 3:30:16| at right at the traffic light if you look at the plan that comes off the main| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12616)|
| 3:30:23| entrance where our traffic light is and we were able to get Jiffy Lube's consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12623)|
| 3:30:27| to do that and I think that was really big because they've had it forever and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12627)|
| 3:30:32| their customers have used this drive in front of our proposed new 8,000 foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12632)|
| 3:30:38| building for 20-something years most of the people that go there are going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12638)|
| 3:30:42| Jiffy Lube coming from the center certainly some but but you can't the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12642)|
| 3:30:49| concern about exiting Jiffy Lube and going across to the Walmart you can't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12649)|
| 3:30:56| legislate poor driving I mean we've got that all over the city we know that you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12656)|
| 3:31:02| can't and so if somebody wants to do that or jump the curb which I'm guilty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12662)|
| 3:31:08| of doing before not there I'm just saying in general but but we've we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12668)|
| 3:31:16| owned the center 23 years and we've never had any issues in fact we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12676)|
| 3:31:21| zero lawsuits we've never been sued about anything on our entrances and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12681)|
| 3:31:26| have seven entrances to traffic lights that people use most of the time and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12686)|
| 3:31:33| just don't see an issue with the exit and last thing I'd say is we have a big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12693)|
| 3:31:37| investment here and you know after 30-something years I think grand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12697)|
| 3:31:42| corporations earned the trust of our community that we do good projects and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12702)|
| 3:31:47| if something broken we're going to fix it and so that's a I'm not I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12707)|
| 3:31:55| the Jiffy Lube issue of making it is a real issue but if it becomes the issue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12715)|
| 3:32:00| we'll address it the the and kind of the same thing up here on Cal and Road which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12720)|
| 3:32:09| will be a city issue which my good engineer back here will probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12729)|
| 3:32:15| wrestle with a little bit but we don't see it as an issue but if it becomes an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12735)|
| 3:32:21| issue we're sure going to take care of it the we disagree with Tom on the trips| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12741)|
| 3:32:29| because these two out parcels are not freestanding therefore we get the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12749)|
| 3:32:38| benefit of the trip count of a shopping center because most people go on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12758)|
| 3:32:42| shopping center just going to add this to their trip so we get to use the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12762)|
| 3:32:48| shopping center trip count which is what CDM Smith say it would be 390 or so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12768)|
| 3:32:54| trips which is way below NPCs use on review that requires any kind of traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12774)|
| 3:33:00| impact study which I think 750 so we disagree on that now we've had good| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12780)|
| 3:33:13| meetings with TDOT we expect to work out something in the right away and we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12793)|
| 3:33:18| not we're not trying to delete anything in this use on review that says anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12798)|
| 3:33:23| about having to work with TDOT we just disagree with the two points on the two| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12803)|
| 3:33:29| access points and that's it and we're in agreement with everything else so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12809)|

| 3:34:30| ought to close I don't I don't agree with putting a median there I think they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12870)|
| 3:34:34| ought to close the median there but what everybody does is they'll go all the way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12874)|
| 3:34:38| down to the light and they'll wait till it turns and they'll make a u-turn there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12878)|
| 3:34:41| to get to the liquor store or to the car wash or Salsaritas or even to Chili's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=12881)|

| 3:37:28| properly released and inspected and given them that nature now as far as the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13048)|
| 3:37:34| median is mr. Clancy says closing it that's TDOT's opinion too but that's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13054)|
| 3:37:39| what my best understanding what the developer wants we just want to make it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13059)|
| 3:37:43| more restrictive to prevent people from making those illegal u-turns in what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13063)|
| 3:37:48| they proposed would do that with you know some slight modifications on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13068)|
| 3:37:52| curbing and things still gonna they're still gonna stop traffic right there in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13072)|
| 3:37:56| the middle of the traffic flow to go left I don't think they would it is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13076)|
| 3:37:59| gonna be designed the way that it would be designed it would be restrictive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13079)|
| 3:38:03| people could come out of target and go across and go left people could turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13083)|
| 3:38:07| left from Clinton Highway into their facility but there would be no way for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13087)|
| 3:38:11| anybody to come make a left turn and get through there hey art art if you look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13091)|
| 3:38:17| on up the road through the s-curve Beaver Creek that comes into Clinton| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13097)|
| 3:38:22| Highway yeah I think that's what they're talking we have obviously I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13102)|
| 3:38:26| know I understand that but I think the the Kroger and target will have a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13106)|
| 3:38:32| problem if they lose or left out which is but I think we this triangle that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13112)|
| 3:38:37| we've come up with and probably extending it is what TDOT suggested I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13117)|
| 3:38:42| think we can work that out where it'll it'll prevent that I can go down to item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13122)|
| 3:38:48| number seven and TDOT being required to work on that is is that covers it I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13128)|
| 3:38:57| mean for rather than take half of four out that doesn't address it the part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13137)|
| 3:39:01| that addresses this I think is also addressed in seven so that's why I took| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13141)|
| 3:39:06| it out all together okay you're still working with TDOT yeah and that's how| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13146)|
| 3:39:11| that permit goes I I have it in a filing cabinet in my cubicle it's still open| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13151)|
| 3:39:16| the problem being is back then in the way things changed is surety was a form| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13156)|
| 3:39:23| of a small check back in the 90s or whenever that was done so it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13163)|
| 3:39:26| enough to cover what they did wrong to get it done right and things have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13166)|
| 3:39:32| changed now since it's been updated so there are more strongholds for TDOT to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13172)|
| 3:39:36| have that done but to answer your question it hasn't been released from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13176)|
| 3:39:39| TDOT standard that they did it right so technically it's an illegal entrance and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13179)|
| 3:39:45| that's where TDOT was of the opinion to we can stop the whole thing if we close| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13185)|
| 3:39:50| the whole median but I don't think that's what anybody wants and we've been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13190)|
| 3:39:53| trying to work towards alleviating that that solution there were some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/PlanningR399190613?start=13193)|
