| 2:57:32| and that curve would be straightened out as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10652)|
| 2:57:37| It wouldn't be a 90-degree angle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10657)|
| 2:57:39| but it would be alleviated by bringing some of the current West Gallagher Ferry onto our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10659)|
| 2:57:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10667)|
| 2:57:51| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10671)|
| 2:57:53| Any other questions from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10673)|
| 2:57:57| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10677)|
| 2:57:58| When you move the road, is there any –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10678)|
| 2:58:01| I'm guessing you're approving the road since you're making a new road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10681)|
| 2:58:04| Are we widening the road at the intersection, or –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10684)|
| 2:58:07| Mr. Snowden, could you maybe speak to that, what the plan is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10687)|
| 2:58:09| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10689)|
| 2:58:10| We would be widening it through the area that we touch to make sure that it's compliant with the current standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10690)|
| 2:58:25| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10705)|
| 2:58:27| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10707)|
| 2:58:28| I guess this is a two-fold question, one for the Planning Commission and one for the Law Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10708)|
| 2:58:36| This is in the rural growth area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10716)|
| 2:58:41| Yes, it's in the rural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10721)|
| 2:58:45| Are we allowed to go over three units an acre in the rural growth area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10725)|
| 2:58:51| I will defer to your law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10731)|
| 2:58:58| It's a difficult question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10738)|
| 2:59:01| If the growth plan is still in effect, I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10741)|
| 2:59:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10752)|
| 2:59:13| All the tech has changed since the last time I was here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10753)|
| 2:59:17| So if the growth plan is still valid, the maximum density is three units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10757)|
| 2:59:23| It is the position of the law director's office that the growth plan is no longer valid,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10763)|
| 2:59:28| because the agreement with the city of Knoxville expired by its own terms in 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10768)|
| 2:59:35| because the plan was designed to be a 20-year plan, which is now, as one of our speakers earlier pointed out, 22 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10775)|
| 2:59:42| So our belief, our feeling, is that it is no longer in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10782)|
| 2:59:48| So if it is not in effect, I believe, and I stand to be corrected,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10788)|
| 2:59:53| but I believe that is the only restriction that would limit you to three units per acre would be the growth plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10793)|
| 3:00:01| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10801)|
| 3:00:04| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10804)|
| 3:00:05| Any further questions or discussion from the Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10805)|
| 3:00:10| Commissioner Hill, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10810)|
| 3:00:19| Hello, Mr. Ekey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10819)|
| 3:00:21| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10821)|
| 3:00:26| What you're proposing on this road is much needed and will be appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10826)|
| 3:00:35| I'd also like to ask Mr. Snowden to address that whole area there has been impacted through the years by a great deal of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10835)|
| 3:00:48| and would you just give us an overview of exactly what the plan is there with Hardin Valley Road, West Gallagher View,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10848)|
| 3:01:02| Hickory Creek, and, you know, how that is going to be all tying in now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10862)|
| 3:01:08| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10868)|
| 3:01:09| I'd be glad to, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10869)|
| 3:01:11| Obviously, just immediately to the east of there is a real kind of an odd intersection of East Gallagher Ferry, Hickory Creek, and Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10871)|
| 3:01:19| You've got a hard 90-degree curve, and then pretty much 100 feet upstream of there is an intersection of Hickory Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10879)|
| 3:01:27| So we actually have completed the design, acquired the necessary right-of-way in partnership with Ball Homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10887)|
| 3:01:34| and have that project out to build a roundabout kind of off-alignment there to the south,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10894)|
| 3:01:43| and hopefully we'll have that construction contract to you guys for approval in February,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10903)|
| 3:01:49| anticipated to be somewhere in the neighborhood of $1.3 million of public improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10909)|
| 3:01:55| 25 percent of which Ball Homes is paying for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10915)|
| 3:01:58| That was codified as part of the traffic analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10918)|
| 3:02:01| So we're excited about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10921)|
| 3:02:05| That curve sees a lot of crashes because it's a long tangent section and makes a really sharp turn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10925)|
| 3:02:11| So we're excited that we think that will be a significant capacity and safety improvement for that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10931)|
| 3:02:20| And that's in addition to what Mr. Hickey has just talked about and you've shared as far as the straightening of West Gallagher?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10940)|
| 3:02:29| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10949)|
| 3:02:30| That would be a separate issue that we would codify as this plan moved forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10950)|
| 3:02:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10955)|
| 3:02:37| Well, that is much appreciated, and it's kind of a lot of it so much after the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10957)|
| 3:02:44| because all this development had to occur to make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10964)|
| 3:02:47| But having that said, I very much support those improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10967)|
| 3:02:52| and very much support West Gallagher View and the safety factor that that could bring if this sector plan amendment is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10972)|
| 3:03:07| We are on that, not the density, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10987)|
| 3:03:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10990)|
| 3:03:12| I'd like to go ahead and make a motion that we approve the change in the sector plan as requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10992)|
| 3:03:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=10999)|
| 3:03:20| I have a motion by Commissioner Hill, second by Commissioner Ward to amend the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11000)|
| 3:03:25| Is that per recommendation of the Planning Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11005)|
| 3:03:29| Thank you. Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11009)|
| 3:03:31| Thank you, Chairman Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11011)|
| 3:03:33| Director Snowden, whenever you say the roundabout, is that going to take any of the covered bridge property away?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11013)|
| 3:03:39| It won't, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11019)|
| 3:03:41| We're moving it into kind of the new ball homes development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11021)|
| 3:03:47| That helps us build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11027)|
| 3:03:50| We can essentially build the roundabout off of Lima and then turn traffic into it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11030)|
| 3:03:55| so it will be a big benefit from the maintenance of traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11035)|
| 3:03:57| It will be less inconvenient to the folks that drive the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11037)|
| 3:04:01| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11041)|
| 3:04:04| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11044)|
| 3:04:06| Commissioner Hill, your light is still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11046)|
| 3:04:08| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11048)|
| 3:04:09| We have a motion by Commissioner Hill with a second by Commissioner Ward to amend the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11049)|
| 3:04:14| Per the recommendation of the Planning Commission, any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11054)|
| 3:04:18| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11058)|
| 3:04:19| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11059)|
| 3:04:20| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11060)|
| 3:04:21| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11061)|
| 3:04:23| Madam Clerk, next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11063)|
| 3:04:25| Item number 46, request of ball homes LLC for rezoning from agricultural to PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11065)|
| 3:04:32| up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11072)|
| 3:04:34| Property located at 2205 West Gallagher Ferry Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11074)|
| 3:04:38| Personal ID 12905 in the 6th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11078)|
| 3:04:44| Thank you, Madam Clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11084)|
| 3:04:45| I'll ask the applicant, if you would please, to state your name and address one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11085)|

| 3:04:57| I represent Ball Homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11097)|
| 3:05:00| And I would stand on what I had said before and only add to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11100)|
| 3:05:04| Once again, you see where we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11104)|
| 3:05:06| I do need to ask if there's opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11106)|
| 3:05:08| Sorry, Mr. Banks, I didn't mean to interrupt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11108)|
| 3:05:10| Okay. Mr. Murphy, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11110)|
| 3:05:12| Ms. Frazier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11112)|

| 3:05:19| Chair will recognize Ms. Brooks, then I'll return to Mr. Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11119)|
| 3:05:22| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve PR plan residential zoning up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11122)|
| 3:05:29| Because it is consistent with the growth policy plan by vote of 14-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11129)|
| 3:05:33| Thank you, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11133)|
| 3:05:34| Mr. Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11134)|
| 3:05:36| Once again, we have a developer who participates in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11136)|
| 3:05:40| Ball Homes has always done, in all of their developments in this community, has done what they said they're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11140)|
| 3:05:47| They've always added a little bit more than what they were supposed to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11147)|
| 3:05:51| As in this case, they're helping straighten out a road that needs straightening out in the worst possible way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11151)|
| 3:05:59| As I said before, we asked for four, got three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11159)|
| 3:06:02| In order for this development to work with the reductions in the acreage, we have to have 3.5 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11162)|
| 3:06:08| and that's what we're asking this commission to give us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11168)|
| 3:06:14| Thank you, Mr. Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11174)|
| 3:06:15| Mr. Murphy, you're recognized, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11175)|
| 3:06:20| Thank you, Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11180)|
| 3:06:21| Kevin Murphy, 4508 Murphy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11181)|
| 3:06:24| There was a question raised about the growth plan validity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11184)|
| 3:06:27| I would like to, and what else might apply,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11187)|
| 3:06:29| I do want to bring your attention to a couple of items in the zoning ordinance general plan and sector plan that are pertinent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11189)|
| 3:06:37| Knox County zoning ordinance 6.30.01.D deals with amendments to the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11197)|
| 3:06:45| and it says, proposed amendments shall be consistent with and not in conflict with the general plan of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11205)|
| 3:06:50| including any of its elements, major road plan, et cetera.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11210)|
| 3:06:55| The general plan of Knox County, page 68 and 69,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11215)|
| 3:07:00| has a development policy that guides density for residential development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11220)|
| 3:07:05| and it says, it has one that says low density, one to three dwelling units in rural areas with infrastructure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11225)|
| 3:07:11| one unit in rural areas where you may have infrastructure inadequate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11231)|
| 3:07:16| So there is a policy in the general plan that says you're limited to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11236)|
| 3:07:22| Finally, more specifically for this area, is the northwest county sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11242)|
| 3:07:26| which is an element of the Knox County general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11246)|
| 3:07:29| On page 67, there's a land use classification table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11249)|
| 3:07:32| That table sets out what your recommended zonings are per land use category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11252)|
| 3:07:38| You've just voted for rural residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11258)|
| 3:07:41| And in that, it has a recommend zoning program in county's rural areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11261)|
| 3:07:45| It talks about open space, blah, blah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11265)|
| 3:07:47| But it says, in the county rural area, planned residential at densities of one dwelling unit per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11267)|
| 3:07:52| if dwellings are clustered in one portion of a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11272)|
| 3:07:55| You may also consider it has a guideline there of ag or PR in the growth plan's rural area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11275)|
| 3:08:01| at densities up to three dwelling units per acre or less if dwelling units are clustered in one portion of a subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11281)|
| 3:08:06| So the general plan and the sector plan both have limits that hit three units per acre at the very maximum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11286)|
| 3:08:13| The recommended zoning in the rural residential area is one unit per acre for PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11293)|
| 3:08:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11298)|
| 3:08:21| Thank you, Mr. Murphy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11301)|
| 3:08:23| Are there any questions or comments from the commissioners on this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11303)|
| 3:08:28| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11308)|
| 3:08:30| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11310)|
| 3:08:32| Director Brooks, the applicant in the previous discussion mentioned the slope analysis in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11312)|
| 3:08:42| And in looking at the slope analysis that NOx Planning put into place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11322)|
| 3:08:51| it looks like the maximum density is two dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11331)|
| 3:08:56| and then the proposed density from the applicant in the original application was four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11336)|
| 3:09:05| Did the planning commission, in essence, split the difference when they saw two units per acre and four units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11345)|
| 3:09:15| and came up with three dwelling units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11355)|
| 3:09:21| Staff's recommendation was PR zoning up to three dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11361)|
| 3:09:29| That's correct, but I'm saying to justify their position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11369)|
| 3:09:34| did they look at the slope analysis and then what the original applicant applied for at four units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11374)|
| 3:09:41| and decided to follow the staff's recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11381)|
| 3:09:45| I don't recall a significant discussion on the slope analysis for this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11385)|
| 3:09:58| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11398)|
| 3:09:59| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11399)|
| 3:10:02| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11402)|
| 3:10:04| Director Snowden, approximately how much land will be given up to make the realignment with West Gallaher Ferry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11404)|
| 3:10:12| That's hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11412)|
| 3:10:14| We're still in the kind of preliminary discussions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11414)|
| 3:10:20| Let me look here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11420)|
| 3:10:23| Down at the intersection proper, there'll be quite a bit of area that they'll have to give up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11423)|
| 3:10:29| because it comes down at West Gallaher Ferry and tees in at Hickory Creek at such a skewed angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11429)|
| 3:10:34| We're going to have to go from essentially 45 to 90.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11434)|
| 3:10:38| So, I mean, there would be a significant amount of property that would be dedicated to the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11438)|
| 3:10:44| that they otherwise wouldn't have to do if it was just a major road plan dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11444)|
| 3:10:50| Do you think it would be more than 3.9 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11450)|
| 3:10:53| 3.9 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11453)|
| 3:11:01| It's hard to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11461)|
| 3:11:07| I'd hazard to even guess, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11467)|
| 3:11:10| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11470)|
| 3:11:11| It's just without having a set of plans, it's so hard to gauge those right-of-ways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11471)|
| 3:11:15| I would hate to give an opinion and it be incorrect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11475)|
| 3:11:21| We're looking at a 23.8-acre site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11481)|
| 3:11:26| If I run the numbers at three and a half, then I run them at three minus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11486)|
| 3:11:36| I guess what I'm trying to say is it's going to be really close to the same build-out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11496)|
| 3:11:44| You get a road improvement or you die.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11504)|
| 3:11:46| It's going to be close to the same number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11506)|
| 3:11:50| And if it's over four units an acre, they're actually going to lose houses by doing it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11510)|
| 3:12:02| Thank you, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11522)|
| 3:12:03| I have a question for Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11523)|
| 3:12:06| Was the three-unit per acre limit as set for rural areas under the general plan and growth plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11526)|
| 3:12:13| considered by the staff in recommending three units per acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11533)|
| 3:12:17| Yes, it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11537)|
| 3:12:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11538)|
| 3:12:24| Any other questions from the commissioners?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11544)|
| 3:12:30| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11550)|
| 3:12:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11552)|
| 3:12:35| I do notice that the developments immediately across the street and next to it are zoned at three or less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11555)|
| 3:12:46| And I would feel very comfortable giving a recommendation at three per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11566)|
| 3:12:52| So that is my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11572)|
| 3:12:57| I have a motion by Commissioner Hill to approve the rezoning at three units per acre per the Planning Commission's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11577)|
| 3:13:06| Is that correct, Commissioner Hill?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11586)|
| 3:13:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11588)|
| 3:13:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11589)|
| 3:13:10| The second by Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11590)|
| 3:13:12| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11592)|
| 3:13:13| Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11593)|
| 3:13:15| If we do three an acre, we don't get any road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11595)|
| 3:13:19| If we do 3.5, we build the same amount of houses, basically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11599)|
| 3:13:25| Because we're giving up the curve and we're giving up the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11605)|
| 3:13:31| I don't see why we don't do 3.5 so we get road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11611)|
| 3:13:36| We have the same amount of building houses that we're going to get out of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11616)|
| 3:13:44| Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11624)|
| 3:13:45| Mr. Stone, is that the way you would interpret that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11625)|
| 3:13:52| Could you state the question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11632)|
| 3:13:54| What I'm saying is if they do 3.5, they've agreed to do the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11634)|
| 3:14:00| So at three, they're not doing the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11640)|
| 3:14:04| So at 3.5, they're going to take land away from the development to acreage away, to strain out the bend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11644)|
| 3:14:13| and then to also straighten out and go 90 at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11653)|
| 3:14:17| So they're losing an acreage that they cannot build on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11657)|
| 3:14:21| So we're either approving it at three, getting no road improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11661)|
| 3:14:27| or we approve it at 3.5, get the same amount of houses, but also get the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11667)|
| 3:14:34| It makes sense to do 3.5 so we get the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11674)|
| 3:14:37| Why wouldn't we not do that if we're building the same amount of houses at three| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11677)|
| 3:14:40| with no road improvements versus 3.5 with road improvements?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11680)|
| 3:14:44| Because we're taking away acreage at the 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11684)|
| 3:14:47| So I'm going to make a substitute motion to do 3.5 units an acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11687)|
| 3:14:52| because I would much rather have our roads improved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11692)|
| 3:14:55| and have the same amount of houses built at three than at 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11695)|
| 3:15:00| I have a substitute motion by Commissioner Ward to approve this rezoning at 3.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11700)|
| 3:15:18| If there is no second, we will return to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11718)|
| 3:15:23| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11723)|
| 3:15:26| Commissioner Bussler, you seconded the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11726)|
| 3:15:28| There are other lights on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11728)|
| 3:15:30| Before you is Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11730)|
| 3:15:33| No, you can take a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11733)|
| 3:15:34| I have a clarifying question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11734)|
| 3:15:36| Well, the second is noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11736)|
| 3:15:38| So the second motion is on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11738)|
| 3:15:39| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11739)|
| 3:15:40| How many units would be built with three or 3.5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11740)|
| 3:15:46| Is it indeed the same number of actual houses?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11746)|
| 3:15:49| So where we are is we need to build right at 85 houses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11749)|
| 3:15:56| based on our calculation to make the road improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11756)|
| 3:16:00| and make it a feasible project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11760)|
| 3:16:03| Eighty-five houses at 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11763)|
| 3:16:06| Well, 85 houses divided by the total acreage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11766)|
| 3:16:11| If it's 3.5 units an acre, you will build 85 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11771)|
| 3:16:15| Yes or no?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11775)|
| 3:16:18| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11778)|
| 3:16:19| I didn't look at it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11779)|
| 3:16:20| I'm trying to answer Commissioner Ward's question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11780)|
| 3:16:22| Is it the same number of homes at either density?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11782)|
| 3:16:25| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11785)|
| 3:16:26| Give me the difference in the homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11786)|
| 3:16:28| About nine units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11788)|
| 3:16:30| So it's 85 at the 3.5?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11790)|
| 3:16:33| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11793)|
| 3:16:34| And then it's 76 at the 3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11794)|
| 3:16:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11800)|
| 3:16:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11801)|
| 3:16:42| I just wanted to clarify.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11802)|
| 3:16:43| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11803)|
| 3:16:44| It's not the same number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11804)|
| 3:16:45| No, not exactly, but they need the money off of those extra nine homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11805)|
| 3:16:49| to pay for the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11809)|
| 3:16:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11811)|
| 3:16:52| Because if they don't get the extra nine homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11812)|
| 3:16:53| then they don't pay for the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11813)|
| 3:16:56| Because the money has to come from somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11816)|
| 3:17:03| It's nine units, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11823)|
| 3:17:04| It's about nine units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11824)|
| 3:17:06| I mean, you know, we have 23 acres of land invested in, 23 1⁄2 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11826)|
| 3:17:14| We give up a set amount to do a road improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11834)|
| 3:17:16| We contribute to a road improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11836)|
| 3:17:18| And at the end of the day, it takes more density to get more money back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11838)|
| 3:17:28| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11848)|
| 3:17:30| Mr. Hickey, I'm hearing you right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11850)|
| 3:17:33| You're not going to do the project unless you get the 3.5, or do the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11853)|
| 3:17:37| unless you get the 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11857)|
| 3:17:38| Is that what you're saying?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11858)|
| 3:17:40| Essentially, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11860)|
| 3:17:42| Mr. Snowden, can we require road improvements as part of the development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11862)|
| 3:17:51| They have frontage along Hickory Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11871)|
| 3:17:55| so they could install an entrance along Hickory Creek and avoid the intersection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11875)|
| 3:18:01| and then the county wouldn't necessarily –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11881)|
| 3:18:04| we couldn't necessarily bring them into the conversation to improve the existing intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11884)|
| 3:18:10| because they have frontage along the existing road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11890)|
| 3:18:13| In your opinion, would that be better as far as traffic flow?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11893)|
| 3:18:18| No, I would rather them come in at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11898)|
| 3:18:22| That way we – a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11902)|
| 3:18:24| One, we can get the intersection improved at a reduced cost to the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11904)|
| 3:18:30| with their partnership, as well as we limit conflict points along Hickory Creek Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11910)|
| 3:18:35| So there's a benefit to the public, in my eyes, in my professional opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11915)|
| 3:18:40| to allow and work with the developer to put the intersection in at the current location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11920)|
| 3:18:49| My calculator is not working because my phone tore up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11929)|
| 3:18:52| Somebody tell me what 23 point – what was it, three?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11932)|
| 3:18:58| Times three times 3.5.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11938)|
| 3:19:02| What's the total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11942)|
| 3:19:09| At three it's 71.4.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11949)|
| 3:19:12| At three point five it's 83.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11952)|
| 3:19:14| At four it's 95.2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11954)|
| 3:19:26| I'm kind of disappointed that you're not holding that over us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11966)|
| 3:19:30| After all –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11970)|
| 3:19:31| After all that we gave you approval for in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11971)|
| 3:19:38| it's kind of disappointing that you would hold that over us as far as that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11978)|
| 3:19:45| It's kind of disappointing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11985)|
| 3:19:47| Well, Mr. Day, I'm not trying to hold anything over anyone's head at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11987)|
| 3:19:52| I take that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11992)|
| 3:19:54| We'll just disagree on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11994)|
| 3:19:59| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=11999)|
| 3:20:01| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12001)|
| 3:20:03| Mr. Snowden, if we have to come back later on and improve that road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12003)|
| 3:20:07| what would it cost the county to do the improvement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12007)|
| 3:20:12| It would be obviously much harder for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12012)|
| 3:20:16| because if they were to choose to do an alternate alignment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12016)|
| 3:20:20| and have a road in off of Hickory Creek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12020)|
| 3:20:24| all we would get would be the standard right-of-way dedication of 25 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12024)|
| 3:20:29| So for us to align the roadway in a better fashion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12029)|
| 3:20:34| we'd probably have to buy right-of-way from a homeowner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12034)|
| 3:20:39| and potentially pay damages to that landowner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12039)|
| 3:20:42| because the right-of-way wouldn't be set back very far.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12042)|
| 3:20:45| So it could be an expensive proposition for the county to fix that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12045)|
| 3:20:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12051)|
| 3:20:52| And go a little bit farther.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12052)|
| 3:20:54| The safety factor about doing what you want to do now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12054)|
| 3:20:58| what he wants to do now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12058)|
| 3:21:00| which is the heightened safety for the people out there in that area as far as?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12060)|
| 3:21:07| It's much better, in my professional opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12067)|
| 3:21:10| to limit access points along a busy roadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12070)|
| 3:21:14| So by doing the proposal that would require the road straightening| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12074)|
| 3:21:22| and the road realignment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12082)|
| 3:21:24| it would be a much safer situation in my professional opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12084)|
| 3:21:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12090)|
| 3:21:34| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12094)|
| 3:21:35| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12095)|
| 3:21:37| Director Snowden, just a clarification question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12097)|
| 3:21:43| Let's say this property is 25 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12103)|
| 3:21:46| It takes them 3 acres to do the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12106)|
| 3:21:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12110)|
| 3:21:52| We would still, if we allowed him at 3 units per acre times 25 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12112)|
| 3:21:58| be 75 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12118)|
| 3:21:59| We'd still allow him to build 75 homes on that property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12119)|
| 3:22:05| even though he agreed to dedicate 3 acres back to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12125)|
| 3:22:11| We would not penalize him on those extra units, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12131)|
| 3:22:18| I'm not sure if I understand the question, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12138)|
| 3:22:22| He's got 25 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12142)|
| 3:22:24| We zone it for 3 units per acre, so that's 75 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12144)|
| 3:22:30| In your discussions with him, you need 3 acres to align the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12150)|
| 3:22:34| like you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12154)|
| 3:22:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12156)|
| 3:22:37| So he has to dedicate those 3 acres back to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12157)|
| 3:22:41| He does not lose the 75 units that he's able to build on that property, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12161)|
| 3:22:50| Even though he's given up 3 acres, which could potentially be 9 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12170)|
| 3:22:57| If this body chooses to give him the additional density, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12177)|
| 3:23:03| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12183)|
| 3:23:04| I agree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12184)|
| 3:23:15| See what I'm getting at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12195)|
| 3:23:16| He's not losing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12196)|
| 3:23:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12197)|
| 3:23:18| Because he's negotiated with Knox County to allow them to make a road improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12198)|
| 3:23:26| So he's still going to get the total number of units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12206)|
| 3:23:30| I'm just using round numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12210)|
| 3:23:31| 3 units per acre, 25 acres, 75 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12211)|
| 3:23:34| He's not going to lose out on 75 homes if that's what this body votes for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12214)|
| 3:23:39| to follow the general plan and all that, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12219)|
| 3:23:45| And Ms. Brooks, do you need to weigh in on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12225)|
| 3:23:52| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12232)|
| 3:23:54| As an engineering director, I need to make recommendations about engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12234)|
| 3:23:59| That feels more like a discussion for the body rather than my position personally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12239)|
| 3:24:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12250)|
| 3:24:12| So in other words, if this body wanted to do 3 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12252)|
| 3:24:17| they could make a motion to allow him 3 units per acre based on the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12257)|
| 3:24:24| of the 23.2 acres that he currently holds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12264)|
| 3:24:28| And if he decides to dedicate 3 or 3.5 acres to a roadway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12268)|
| 3:24:34| he would still be able to maintain that same density of houses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12274)|
| 3:24:40| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12280)|
| 3:24:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12282)|
| 3:24:43| Would you say that into the record instead of nodding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12283)|
| 3:24:45| Yes, and that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12285)|
| 3:24:47| The guys in community TV can't figure out what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12287)|
| 3:24:51| That would be my understanding based on the questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12291)|
| 3:24:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12294)|
| 3:24:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12295)|
| 3:24:57| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12297)|
| 3:24:59| Mr. Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12299)|
| 3:25:01| Go ahead, Mr. Hickey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12301)|
| 3:25:04| If I'm understanding you right, if we have 23 acres out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12304)|
| 3:25:07| and I give 3 acres to whoever in that property zone, that 3 units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12307)|
| 3:25:14| do I now have 20 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12314)|
| 3:25:17| Not for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12317)|
| 3:25:18| If the motion is made to allow you whatever units, 3 units times 23 point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12318)|
| 3:25:25| is it 23.2 acres?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12325)|
| 3:25:26| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12326)|
| 3:25:28| Yes, sir, but zoning runs with land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12328)|
| 3:25:32| If we say that you're able to build 75 units on that acre, on those acres of ground,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12332)|
| 3:25:38| because what happens if you come back and have to give 5 acres for the frontage?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12338)|
| 3:25:43| You're still protected that you're able to build 75 homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12343)|
| 3:25:46| So I guess I'm getting confused where you're on a per unit per acre basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12346)|
| 3:25:53| I'm telling you total number of homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12353)|
| 3:25:55| Then you're going to total number of homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12355)|
| 3:25:57| Total number of lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12357)|
| 3:26:00| If the numbers come out to 71.75 lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12360)|
| 3:26:05| then we would make a motion that you get 72 lots with no penalty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12365)|
| 3:26:11| or allowing Knox County to have a certain number of acres to improve the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12371)|
| 3:26:16| and your access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12376)|
| 3:26:18| I think I'm good with that in theory, but how do you ever control the parcels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12378)|
| 3:26:23| Well, hopefully you've got a good engineering staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12383)|
| 3:26:26| surveying staff to be able to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12386)|
| 3:26:28| Is that the question you'd like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12388)|
| 3:26:30| No, Mr. Schoonmaker, what I'm saying is you've got 25 acres because I've seen this happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12390)|
| 3:26:35| You've got 25 acres and someone has zoned it at 1 unit an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12395)|
| 3:26:40| And now all of a sudden you've got someone that bought 24 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12400)|
| 3:26:45| They built one house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12405)|
| 3:26:47| There's 1 acre left over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12407)|
| 3:26:50| Do you have 24 units left on that 1 acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12410)|
| 3:26:57| One, I don't think you'd get through a concept plan if you had 24 homes on 1 acre of ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12417)|
| 3:27:04| That never happened in Knox County, I would hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12424)|
| 3:27:07| But if we allowed you on 23.8 acres to build X number of homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12427)|
| 3:27:18| and we vote on that and that's approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12438)|
| 3:27:21| and you decide that Ball Homes needs to give 4 acres to Knox County to improve the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12441)|
| 3:27:27| and improve your entrance and exit, then you're not penalized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12447)|
| 3:27:31| You still get that total number of homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12451)|
| 3:27:35| I see where you're going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12455)|
| 3:27:42| Can I ask a point of clarification for the law director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12462)|
| 3:27:46| Are we allowed to set numbers and not zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12466)|
| 3:27:51| I've never had this question come up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12471)|
| 3:27:53| but my understanding is that the duty of the county commission is to set the zone and the density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12473)|
| 3:28:00| not the total number of parcels that can be split out of project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12480)|
| 3:28:04| I've never seen that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12484)|
| 3:28:07| Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12487)|
| 3:28:08| I've never seen it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12488)|
| 3:28:10| But ordinarily, and this is what the planning commission looks at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12490)|
| 3:28:15| this is what you look at, what's the zoning going to be, what's the density going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12495)|
| 3:28:23| So I've never seen a county commission zone a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12503)|
| 3:28:29| and say you may have 75 or whatever the number is, parcels on this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12509)|
| 3:28:35| and whatever the zoning or whatever the density has to be to make that happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12515)|
| 3:28:39| that's what your density is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12519)|
| 3:28:41| I've not seen that done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12521)|
| 3:28:43| I've never had the question raised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12523)|
| 3:28:45| So I don't want to say definitively that it can't be done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12525)|
| 3:28:49| because this is legislative action by the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12529)|
| 3:28:52| but it would be very unusual in my experience to do it that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12532)|
| 3:29:03| I haven't sworn in, but I'm Ball Homes' general counsel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12543)|
| 3:29:05| I just thought I might at least respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12545)|
| 3:29:07| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12547)|
| 3:29:08| Can you state your name, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12548)|
| 3:29:09| Buddy Goodwin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12549)|
| 3:29:10| Did you say you were sworn in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12550)|
| 3:29:11| I have not been sworn in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12551)|
| 3:29:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12552)|
| 3:29:13| Buddy Goodwin, General Counsel, Ball Homes, 1914 Pinnacle Point Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12553)|
| 3:29:18| Yeah, you weren't sworn in or were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12558)|
| 3:29:20| No, I was not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12560)|
| 3:29:21| You saw me swear in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12561)|
| 3:29:22| Oh, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12562)|
| 3:29:23| Yes, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12563)|
| 3:29:24| The testimony you back to the end would be the truth, the whole truth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12564)|
| 3:29:25| and nothing but the truth, so up you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12565)|
| 3:29:26| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12566)|
| 3:29:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12567)|
| 3:29:28| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12568)|
| 3:29:29| I just want to be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12569)|
| 3:29:30| I don't want you guys ever thinking there's some kind of wool being pulled here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12570)|
| 3:29:32| because, I mean, this is the way I understand this would work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12572)|
| 3:29:34| And you have to remember, every time we do a development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12574)|
| 3:29:36| and you're going to just right away kind of like it's like pulling the numbers out of density and stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12576)|
| 3:29:42| I mean, that's not really how it works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12582)|
| 3:29:44| I mean, even the developments we do, all the roads are in the middle of the developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12584)|
| 3:29:48| They end up being dedicated as right away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12588)|
| 3:29:50| I mean, we dedicate right away in every development we do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12590)|
| 3:29:54| And that doesn't reduce the density or increase the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12594)|
| 3:29:57| I mean, I think this is a real kind of simple scenario, and I don't think, you know, Mr. Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12597)|
| 3:30:02| I just want you to understand we're not trying to hold anything over anybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12602)|
| 3:30:05| We got this property under contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12605)|
| 3:30:08| We think it's a good piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12608)|
| 3:30:09| It lays really well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12609)|
| 3:30:11| We laid out a plan, and my understanding is we ended up through the engineering department talking with you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12611)|
| 3:30:16| and you thought it might be a good idea to redo this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12616)|
| 3:30:19| So we responded to that, and we thought, well, how can we, you know, redo this plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12619)|
| 3:30:23| and maybe respond to that request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12623)|
| 3:30:25| And keep in mind, in your process, the cart comes a little before the horse in different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12625)|
| 3:30:32| We're here trying to get density, but yet the concept plan is where this gets worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12632)|
| 3:30:36| And this is where we come back and we figure it all out, and we actually go down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12636)|
| 3:30:39| and he gets to come and say, hey, we agree with what they've done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12639)|
| 3:30:42| and, you know, they're participating well and they're doing good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12642)|
| 3:30:46| Because when I hear you talking about dedicating right away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12646)|
| 3:30:49| I think on something like this it might be some dedication.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12649)|
| 3:30:52| He might want us to participate in some of the cost of doing this and that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12652)|
| 3:30:56| That will get worked out, and we will do it in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12656)|
| 3:30:59| But what we're talking about here, and I realize there are issues in this area with a lot of density,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12659)|
| 3:31:05| but the 3 to 3.5 here, this is not, you know, 2,000 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12665)|
| 3:31:09| It's eight or nine units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12669)|
| 3:31:11| Eight or nine units, which we thought, well, if we relay this out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12671)|
| 3:31:15| and we kind of bring the road into play in our development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12675)|
| 3:31:19| can we get some more units to try to help accommodate that and make a better plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12679)|
| 3:31:22| that will use the density better, stop sprawl, use the land the best we can,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12682)|
| 3:31:27| and help with the road improvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12687)|
| 3:31:29| That's where we are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12689)|
| 3:31:31| And so that's what we're asking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12691)|
| 3:31:32| We're asking for nine units so we can make that happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12692)|
| 3:31:34| If it doesn't happen, I mean, if we don't get it done and he doesn't like what we're contributing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12694)|
| 3:31:39| he's going to be at the concept plant telling them, you know, this isn't going to work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12699)|
| 3:31:44| So just understand, there's no hand-wringing here or no holding over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12704)|
| 3:31:49| It's just part of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12709)|
| 3:31:50| We don't have all the answers right now because we haven't got to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12710)|
| 3:31:54| I just want to make sure that's clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12714)|
| 3:31:56| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12716)|
| 3:31:59| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12719)|
| 3:32:00| I believe I'm going to go to Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12720)|
| 3:32:03| Commissioner Ward is the maker of the motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12723)|
| 3:32:05| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12725)|
| 3:32:08| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12728)|
| 3:32:12| As a legislative body, we're not here to make money for the applicant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12732)|
| 3:32:18| and we're not trying to mess over the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12738)|
| 3:32:21| What we're here to do is to take a look at what the developer said he would do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12741)|
| 3:32:27| Now, if he said that he gets 3.5 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12747)|
| 3:32:31| he's going to fix a road that in some ways would be a little bit safer for the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12751)|
| 3:32:38| If he doesn't, the road is not fixed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12758)|
| 3:32:41| and then down the road we've got a problem because he's going to have to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12761)|
| 3:32:45| from what I understand from Mr. Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12765)|
| 3:32:48| he would have to bring the road entrance into the subdivision someplace else, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12768)|
| 3:32:55| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12775)|
| 3:32:56| And there could be an option presented that they would have an access point independent of West Galahar Ferry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12776)|
| 3:33:04| So we can either do one of two things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12784)|
| 3:33:07| We can either do something that will take care of a safety issue and a problem down the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12787)|
| 3:33:13| which will not affect the taxpayers and could and would help the community in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12793)|
| 3:33:19| Or we could do three and put another dangerous entrance on a dangerous road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12799)|
| 3:33:25| So it's the choice there between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12805)|
| 3:33:29| I don't care if he goes in there and gets a concept plan and he comes back and they said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12809)|
| 3:33:35| Mr. Snowden says, well, you only can get this many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12815)|
| 3:33:38| But he's made a commitment publicly that if we zone it that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12818)|
| 3:33:42| he's going to have to fix it before he can get that many units or not from the concept plan, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12822)|
| 3:33:48| I didn't hear a bit of the last part of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12828)|
| 3:33:51| Okay, if you take a concept plan to Mr. Snowden here and he says it will not work with that many units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12831)|
| 3:34:00| even with 3.5 units, this is what you can get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12840)|
| 3:34:04| You still commit to fix the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12844)|
| 3:34:08| If you get the zoning and the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12848)|
| 3:34:11| I think that's the point is we have to go through that process to confirm we can do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12851)|
| 3:34:15| And if we can't do it, then what does it matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12855)|
| 3:34:18| We're not using the density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12858)|
| 3:34:20| We're only building three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12860)|
| 3:34:21| We're only building two and a half if we don't use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12861)|
| 3:34:24| So, Mr. Bussler, what I'll say we'll do is that we will put an appropriate number of lots in this subdivision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12864)|
| 3:34:32| and build an appropriate infrastructure that satisfies Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12872)|
| 3:34:38| What about the road work?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12878)|
| 3:34:40| It will improve the roadway to satisfy Knox County Engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12880)|
| 3:34:44| Even if you can't get to 3.5 per unit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12884)|
| 3:34:47| Yeah, if we're at 3.4 or 3.3, but, I mean, it's hard to nail down right now, guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12887)|
| 3:34:55| Okay, I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12895)|
| 3:34:57| But what I'm saying is if the concept plan comes back and you don't get, let's say, three units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12897)|
| 3:35:05| even though it's a zone for 3.5 because the plan just will not work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12905)|
| 3:35:10| At some point in time, it wouldn't make financial sense to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12910)|
| 3:35:15| The cost of the road improvement would be greater than, you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12915)|
| 3:35:20| I understand that, but we're committing to something now for that zoning on that piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12920)|
| 3:35:26| and we don't have a concept plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12926)|
| 3:35:28| I think that's ...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12928)|
| 3:35:29| That's your process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12929)|
| 3:35:30| But, anyway, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12930)|
| 3:35:33| If I don't get a commitment, they do the concept plan and they can't get the units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12933)|
| 3:35:41| then we're still stuck with a bad road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12941)|
| 3:35:45| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12945)|
| 3:35:46| Commissioner Durrett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12946)|
| 3:35:48| I have a question for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12948)|
| 3:35:53| You just said that the growth plan is no longer valid, but what about the general plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12953)|
| 3:35:58| Does that apply and limit what we can do in this situation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12958)|
| 3:36:04| Commissioner Durrett, I'm not prepared to answer that question tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12964)|
| 3:36:08| because it really wasn't brought to my attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12968)|
| 3:36:11| The planning commission limited three based on the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12971)|
| 3:36:15| so I did not look at the question of the growth of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12975)|
| 3:36:19| I don't know what the limitations are on the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12979)|
| 3:36:22| I defer to the director on that, but this is a legislative body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12982)|
| 3:36:29| and I think that anything you do that has a rational basis can be supported in law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12989)|
| 3:36:37| I don't know that your hands are tied by the general plan, but, like I said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=12997)|
| 3:36:42| what the Knoxville-Knox County planning was looking at was the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13002)|
| 3:36:51| at least based on their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13011)|
| 3:36:54| So I don't know if they considered whether or not they would be limited by the general plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13014)|
| 3:36:59| or the sector plan or anything else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13019)|
| 3:37:01| The only thing that they've said they were basing their three unit per acre limitation on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13021)|
| 3:37:07| was the growth policy plan, which we believe has expired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13027)|
| 3:37:12| So I would have to research that question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13032)|
| 3:37:15| I'm not prepared to answer the question tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13035)|
| 3:37:22| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13042)|
| 3:37:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13043)|
| 3:37:25| Director Brooks, did your staff base their decision on the general plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13045)|
| 3:37:35| We take into account a number of different pieces of information that we have at our disposal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13055)|
| 3:37:41| such as the hillside and rooftop plan, which is not an adopted plan by this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13061)|
| 3:37:45| the growth policy plan, as well as the adopted sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13065)|
| 3:37:48| which is a component of the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13068)|
| 3:37:50| So, yes, it was taken into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13070)|
| 3:37:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13072)|
| 3:37:56| Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13076)|
| 3:37:58| Is there any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13078)|
| 3:38:02| Before us is a substitute motion to approve this at a density of 3.5 units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13082)|
| 3:38:07| That motion was by Commissioner Ward with a second by Commissioner Bussle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13087)|
| 3:38:12| All in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13092)|

| 3:41:04| Seeing none, Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13264)|
| 3:41:07| Planning Commission recommends that County Commission approve A Agricultural Zoning because it's consistent with the Northwest County Sector Plan and surrounding zoning by a vote of 15-0 consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13267)|
| 3:41:17| Thank you, Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13277)|
| 3:41:18| Ms. Walter, would you like to speak to your request?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13278)|
| 3:41:23| There's not a lot of need to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13283)|
| 3:41:24| It's just going from industrial to agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13284)|
| 3:41:28| It's in an agricultural area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13288)|
| 3:41:29| It's within the sector plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13289)|
| 3:41:31| So that way, if I wanted to build a house on it down the line, I have the ability to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13291)|
| 3:41:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13298)|
| 3:41:39| Chair, we'll look for a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13299)|
| 3:41:40| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13300)|
| 3:41:41| I have a question for both the applicant and Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13301)|
| 3:41:47| For the applicant, you rezone property in the city in order to open up a couple of urban campsites.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13307)|
| 3:41:55| Is that your plan for this property, too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13315)|
| 3:41:58| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13318)|
| 3:41:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13319)|
| 3:42:00| Ms. Brooks, in the county zoning ordinances, under agricultural, can it be used for that purpose?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13320)|
| 3:42:09| I'll double-check just to confirm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13329)|
| 3:42:12| It's been a while since I have thought about this particular application case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13332)|
| 3:42:23| I believe so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13343)|
| 3:42:25| It could be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13345)|
| 3:42:27| I'll just confirm here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13347)|
| 3:42:30| I don't want to speak incorrectly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13350)|
| 3:42:40| 8.27 is open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13360)|
| 3:42:43| My understanding is that it needs to be an open space zone for that to be the case, but she confirmed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13363)|
| 3:42:56| I want to say it's allowed in open space specifically, but not in ag.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13376)|
| 3:43:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13385)|
| 3:43:10| I guess this is a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13390)|
| 3:43:12| I know you applied at the same time for both these zonings, and once you got it from the city, you kind of facked off this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13392)|
| 3:43:19| and I think that's when you discovered that our ag is different than the city's ag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13399)|
| 3:43:23| and our codes are different than their codes for what it could be used for under the ag zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13403)|
| 3:43:28| Am I still correct, Dr. Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13408)|
| 3:43:30| Dr. Director Brooks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13410)|
| 3:43:32| Yeah, I've been elevated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13412)|
| 3:43:34| That's some years to your education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13414)|
| 3:43:37| Yes, that's correct, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13417)|
| 3:43:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13419)|
| 3:43:40| Then I guess my question is, what is the purpose of going from industrial to ag?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13420)|
| 3:43:48| That way I can build a home on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13428)|
| 3:43:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13430)|
| 3:43:52| I have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13432)|
| 3:43:54| I have a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13434)|
| 3:43:56| Is that per Planning Commission recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13436)|
| 3:43:58| Per Planning Commission recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13438)|
| 3:44:00| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13440)|
| 3:44:02| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13442)|
| 3:44:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13444)|
| 3:44:05| This question is for Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13445)|
| 3:44:07| How many acres in the city did they have for the urban?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13447)|
| 3:44:13| That's probably a good question for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13453)|
| 3:44:15| A little over 10 acres, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13455)|
| 3:44:17| It's a special use permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13457)|
| 3:44:21| She has a house in a subdivision, and she has purchased two tracts behind it, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13461)|
| 3:44:28| It's three parcels, a little over 24 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13468)|
| 3:44:33| And some of that is in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13473)|
| 3:44:35| 10 acres is in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13475)|
| 3:44:37| The other two parcels are in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13477)|
| 3:44:41| There's two parcels in the county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13481)|
| 3:44:42| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13482)|
| 3:44:43| What's the other parcel in the county currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13483)|
| 3:44:45| It's agricultural, as well as the 10 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13485)|
| 3:44:49| That's the parcel farther to the west, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13489)|
| 3:44:52| Away from the railroad tracks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13492)|
| 3:44:53| Yeah, correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13493)|
| 3:44:55| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13495)|
| 3:44:57| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13497)|
| 3:44:59| This seems like a landlocked piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13499)|
| 3:45:02| I don't see any roads or infrastructure to get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13502)|
| 3:45:05| How would you build a house there if you have no infrastructure to access it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13505)|
| 3:45:09| I would build a driveway from my existing driveway to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13509)|
| 3:45:14| I'm trying to figure out where a driveway would go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13514)|
| 3:45:17| You don't own the parcels next to it, and it's a railroad track across the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13517)|
| 3:45:23| No, you're looking to the subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13523)|
| 3:45:25| That's where her house is, and she has a driveway there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13525)|
| 3:45:27| There is limited access across that railroad track, I think, for an industrial use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13527)|
| 3:45:36| Look in Huntington Hills West, back in that cul-de-sac.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13536)|
| 3:45:39| That's where her house is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13539)|
| 3:45:42| I'm correct, aren't I, ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13542)|
| 3:45:44| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13544)|
| 3:45:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13545)|
| 3:45:47| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13547)|
| 3:45:50| Yeah, I would vote for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13550)|
| 3:45:52| But Director Brooks, getting a rural retreat, anything in 20 acres, they can do a rural retreat?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13552)|
| 3:46:00| And if so, does that include the city's property, or is that just county property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13560)|
| 3:46:05| Just the county property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13565)|
| 3:46:07| They couldn't do a rural retreat because there's not enough land there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13567)|
| 3:46:11| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13571)|
| 3:46:15| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13575)|
| 3:46:16| Commissioner Jay, your light was still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13576)|
| 3:46:18| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13578)|
| 3:46:19| We have a motion by Commissioner Smith, seconded by Commissioner Bussler, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13579)|
| 3:46:24| to approve per Planning Commission recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13584)|
| 3:46:27| All those in favor, please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13587)|
| 3:46:28| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13588)|
| 3:46:29| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13589)|
| 3:46:31| That motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13591)|
| 3:46:33| Congratulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13593)|
| 3:46:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13594)|
| 3:46:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13595)|
| 3:46:38| We'll make one more call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13598)|
| 3:46:40| Is Mr. Sharma present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13600)|
| 3:46:44| Commissioners, I suppose we need to take some sort of action on Item 37.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13604)|
| 3:46:48| I look to the Rules Committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13608)|
| 3:46:49| Is that an automatic 30-day postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13609)|
| 3:46:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13612)|
| 3:46:55| Okay, number 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13615)|
| 3:46:57| 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13617)|
| 3:46:59| Oh, 40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13619)|
| 3:47:01| Oh, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13621)|
| 3:47:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13622)|
| 3:47:03| Is anyone here representing Mr. Wilkerson's estate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13623)|
| 3:47:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13630)|
| 3:47:12| That item will also be automatically postponed until the February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13632)|
| 3:47:16| Can we send another letter out?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13636)|
| 3:47:18| And I need to get his phone number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13638)|
| 3:47:21| Yes, we will notify that applicant that they need to be present at the February meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13641)|
| 3:47:26| We do have one more item under other business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13646)|
| 3:47:30| That is Item 48.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13650)|
| 3:47:31| Madam Clerk, please read it into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13651)|
| 3:47:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13654)|
| 3:47:40| Item number 48 is a discussion item regarding Planning Commission's request to review the planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13660)|
| 3:47:50| Chair, we'll look to Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13670)|
| 3:47:52| I believe this was put on by the Mayor's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13672)|
| 3:47:55| Yes, it was in combination with planning, and Amy and I can both talk about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13675)|
| 3:48:02| This is something that one of our planning commissioners, I think Planning Commissioner Smith,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13682)|
| 3:48:07| Eddie Smith, had asked about, that we had, I guess, started an update of the planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13687)|
| 3:48:15| before the Mayor had chosen to update the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13695)|
| 3:48:23| So we got into that, and then the comprehensive plan started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13703)|
| 3:48:27| So what Engineering and Public Works and the Mayor's Office felt most appropriate was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13707)|
| 3:48:34| seeing as how we're in the middle of this very large, comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13714)|
| 3:48:40| we didn't feel like, at the time, that we wanted to kind of defer the large-scale edits to the planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13720)|
| 3:48:50| because of that large plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13730)|
| 3:48:52| We felt like that it was kind of the tail wagging the dog a little bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13732)|
| 3:48:56| We wanted to let the comprehensive plan work through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13736)|
| 3:49:00| and then devote our energies into addressing the zoning coordinate specifics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13740)|
| 3:49:04| Now, we can make some minor text edits as need be, but it was my office's opinion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13744)|
| 3:49:10| as well as the Mayor's Office, and I'll let Amy speak to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13750)|
| 3:49:13| that we felt like actually updating the zone in the middle of a comprehensive plan was a little problematic for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13753)|
| 3:49:24| Ms. Brooks, would you like to add to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13764)|
| 3:49:26| I don't have too much more to add to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13766)|
| 3:49:28| Director Stone covered most of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13768)|
| 3:49:29| I will just reaffirm that it might be appropriate to consider some minor edits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13769)|
| 3:49:36| but given that this is the most frequently used residential zone in the county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13776)|
| 3:49:43| I think that letting the comprehensive land use and transportation plan play out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13783)|
| 3:49:47| and letting recommendations come out of that is really considered the best practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13787)|
| 3:49:53| You do your plan, and then you update your ordinances to implement the plan itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13793)|
| 3:50:00| Thank you both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13800)|
| 3:50:02| Any questions from the Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13802)|
| 3:50:05| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13805)|
| 3:50:07| I've got another subject, not questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13807)|
| 3:50:10| Okay, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13810)|
| 3:50:13| I'll let Commissioner Schoonmaker go, then I'll ask.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13813)|
| 3:50:15| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13815)|
| 3:50:16| Commissioner Schoonmaker, you are recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13816)|
| 3:50:19| Thank you for the deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13819)|
| 3:50:21| So this is dead in the water at this point, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13821)|
| 3:50:26| I believe we are open to direction from this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13826)|
| 3:50:33| The Planning Commissioner, Eddie Smith, had asked us what the timeline was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13833)|
| 3:50:37| So I think what our office, and I don't want to necessarily speak for Director Snowden,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13837)|
| 3:50:43| is that we're not necessarily saying it's dead, but that there is a time to update this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13843)|
| 3:50:48| We do think it needs to be updated, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13848)|
| 3:50:50| But is this the right time to do it, or do we wait until after we finish the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13850)|
| 3:50:54| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13854)|
| 3:50:55| Okay, and that's going to be your recommendation to the County Mayor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13855)|
| 3:50:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13858)|
| 3:50:59| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13859)|
| 3:51:00| Mr. Snowden, the camera can't figure out what you're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13860)|
| 3:51:03| I concur with Amy, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13863)|
| 3:51:05| We feel like it would be premature to undertake such a large edit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13865)|
| 3:51:10| when the comprehensive plan may change some other things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13870)|
| 3:51:13| and we have to go back and change it again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13873)|
| 3:51:15| So I just felt like it was premature.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13875)|
| 3:51:17| Okay, thank you, Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13877)|
| 3:51:18| I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13878)|
| 3:51:20| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13880)|
| 3:51:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13883)|
| 3:51:25| Okay, so there's no fear that we go through all the trouble of a comprehensive zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13885)|
| 3:51:28| where PR is our main driving factor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13888)|
| 3:51:33| and then it changes so much when we go to change the ordinance that it screws up the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13893)|
| 3:51:43| I'm not sure if I followed the question, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13903)|
| 3:51:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13907)|
| 3:51:48| I'll try again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13908)|
| 3:51:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13909)|
| 3:51:52| We're going to put together a comprehensive new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13912)|
| 3:51:55| That plan is going to be based upon the ordinances and zonings that we have already, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13915)|
| 3:51:59| Are we going to go ahead and change all those at the same time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13919)|
| 3:52:03| No, I don't think our comprehensive lane transportation plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13923)|
| 3:52:07| will not be focused on what we currently have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13927)|
| 3:52:13| It will be looking to the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13933)|
| 3:52:15| and ideally providing some new recommendations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13935)|
| 3:52:19| for possibly even different zones for this community to consider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13939)|
| 3:52:22| That's kind of what I was getting at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13942)|
| 3:52:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13943)|
| 3:52:24| If we design this whole plan around the current zonings we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13944)|
| 3:52:28| we get the plan done, and then we decide we're going to change the PR zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13948)|
| 3:52:33| It could lead to unintended consequences for the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13953)|
| 3:52:39| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13959)|
| 3:52:40| But you guys are advising that we wait to make any of those changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13960)|
| 3:52:44| until we've got the plan in place, or do it in the process of making the plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13964)|
| 3:52:51| Did you want to speak?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13971)|
| 3:52:54| Yes, I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13974)|
| 3:52:56| I think we would, Amy and I would, I, and I don't want to speak for Amy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13976)|
| 3:53:01| would agree that it would be prudent to wait and do large-scale edits to the PR zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13981)|
| 3:53:08| after the comprehensive plan is done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13988)|
| 3:53:11| and then we can do a more comprehensive review of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13991)|
| 3:53:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13994)|
| 3:53:15| I trust you guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13995)|
| 3:53:18| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13998)|
| 3:53:19| I'll let you guys fight over who goes first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=13999)|
| 3:53:21| Commissioner Daley, Commissioner Figgs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14001)|
| 3:53:24| This is a little bit of a subject change as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14004)|
| 3:53:26| Is there any documentation where you could prepare me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14006)|
| 3:53:31| or maybe my fellow commissioners as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14011)|
| 3:53:34| where the roundabout access and things of that nature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14014)|
| 3:53:37| how big they're going to be, how much land they're going to take up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14017)|
| 3:53:40| or is there somewhere you could refer me to for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14020)|
| 3:53:44| as well as whenever we're talking about widening the roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14024)|
| 3:53:46| and going into four-lane and divided highways and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14026)|
| 3:53:50| Obviously, I'm asking for maybe a cheat sheet is basically what I'm asking for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14030)|
| 3:53:55| when we come to these specific issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14035)|
| 3:53:57| Or is there something already out there that I can obtain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14037)|
| 3:53:59| We can put it together for you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14039)|
| 3:54:02| We can put together some general cost estimates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14042)|
| 3:54:05| or some general, you know, this size roundabout costs this much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14045)|
| 3:54:08| going from a two-lane to a four-lane costs this much,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14048)|
| 3:54:11| and the right-of-way associated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14051)|
| 3:54:12| So, yeah, we can prepare that and get it to all the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14052)|
| 3:54:15| I would like to base some of that off of the roundabout that's off North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14055)|
| 3:54:19| in, I believe, Concord Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14059)|
| 3:54:23| Yeah, because I know that one's been updated, and it's really nice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14063)|
| 3:54:26| But I really appreciate it, Director Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14066)|
| 3:54:28| I think that would help a lot whenever we're going through some of the issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14068)|
| 3:54:31| that we've seen tonight, just seeing something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14071)|
| 3:54:34| So, yeah, we'll get you that information early next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14074)|
| 3:54:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14077)|
| 3:54:38| If it's just me, I can come by and pick it up, but unless everybody else wants it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14078)|
| 3:54:42| I'm going to rest it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14082)|
| 3:54:44| Director Snowden, a lot of that is determined by the volume of traffic, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14084)|
| 3:54:48| The size of the roundabout, two lanes, four lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14088)|
| 3:54:51| It is, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14091)|
| 3:54:52| It is, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14092)|
| 3:54:53| We can generalize it to the point I think it would be useful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14093)|
| 3:54:57| and I'll be more than happy to email it to the entire group,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14097)|
| 3:55:01| so that everybody gets a copy of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14101)|
| 3:55:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14103)|
| 3:55:04| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14104)|
| 3:55:05| Commissioner Daley, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14105)|
| 3:55:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14107)|
| 3:55:08| Change of subject.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14108)|
| 3:55:10| We can bring it before the Rules Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14110)|
| 3:55:12| but Commissioner Stumacher brought up a good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14112)|
| 3:55:15| You know, with public signs up for zonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14115)|
| 3:55:21| is it five minutes or is it 15 minutes in our rules?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14121)|
| 3:55:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14124)|
| 3:55:26| I guess we need a clarification that they call in and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14126)|
| 3:55:29| I want to speak on zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14129)|
| 3:55:31| They need to know, tell them, say, hey, you've only got 15 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14131)|
| 3:55:35| or do you want us to look at changing that rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14135)|
| 3:55:40| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14140)|
| 3:55:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14141)|
| 3:55:42| I'm just throwing it open for a discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14142)|
| 3:55:44| If you want right before the rules, we can discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14144)|
| 3:55:47| And the bad part about it is you get it to the five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14147)|
| 3:55:52| you could have three hours' worth of importance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14152)|
| 3:55:56| I think there is a –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14156)|
| 3:55:58| I think there is a – granted, for instance, Drew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14158)|
| 3:56:03| I just want to say that the people who signed up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14163)|
| 3:56:06| they signed up online through the Commission Forum website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14166)|
| 3:56:10| They didn't call in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14170)|
| 3:56:11| They signed up online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14171)|
| 3:56:12| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14172)|
| 3:56:13| So if you want me to call them to inform them about the 15 minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14173)|
| 3:56:19| then that needs to be clarified and put in the rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14179)|
| 3:56:21| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14181)|
| 3:56:22| That would be part of this discussion, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14182)|
| 3:56:24| Yeah, that's part of the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14184)|
| 3:56:25| Not right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14185)|
| 3:56:26| Yeah, yeah, because I think, for instance, tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14186)|
| 3:56:30| virtually everybody in the audience was part of the opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14190)|
| 3:56:34| So if you give every person who's here in opposition five minutes each,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14194)|
| 3:56:42| you know, if a person has signed up and they're signing up in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14202)|
| 3:56:49| they're kind of part of the opposition's collective time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14209)|
| 3:56:52| unless you want to have a separate public forum,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14212)|
| 3:56:55| then also allow 15 minutes of opposition when the item is heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14215)|
| 3:56:59| That's the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14219)|
| 3:57:02| So, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14222)|
| 3:57:05| I'm sorry, Commissioner Jay, I think you actually had your light on first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14225)|
| 3:57:08| I wanted to comment on this, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14228)|
| 3:57:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14230)|
| 3:57:11| If that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14231)|
| 3:57:12| What are you going to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14232)|
| 3:57:14| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14234)|
| 3:57:18| I was guilty of this as chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14238)|
| 3:57:20| When it came to zoning, I let everybody speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14240)|
| 3:57:23| signed up as much as they wanted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14243)|
| 3:57:26| Because we heard many times tonight, people don't feel like they've been heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14246)|
| 3:57:30| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14250)|
| 3:57:31| And the worst thing that can happen is people leave here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14251)|
| 3:57:35| without feeling like they've been heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14255)|
| 3:57:38| So I've always, when I've been up here and people are screaming at us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14258)|
| 3:57:44| whenever I'm here, one in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14264)|
| 3:57:47| I've always known that I signed up for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14267)|
| 3:57:50| And whatever it takes to make sure that people feel that they've been heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14270)|
| 3:57:54| I'm willing to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14274)|
| 3:57:55| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14275)|
| 3:57:56| Thank you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14276)|
| 3:57:57| Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14277)|
| 3:57:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14278)|
| 3:57:59| Yeah, I would agree that the chairman has a lot of discretion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14279)|
| 3:58:01| And as long as there's a balanced approach to hearing it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14281)|
| 3:58:05| we do get into zonings at times where you do hear the same thing over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14285)|
| 3:58:10| and over and over and over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14290)|
| 3:58:11| And sometimes you have to sort of ask them to pick three or four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14291)|
| 3:58:14| or five people depending on the volume of the night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14294)|
| 3:58:16| But I think it's – I would argue that anything that happens after one is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14296)|
| 3:58:21| really bad, and I'll say that from experience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14301)|
| 3:58:23| So I would set your rules ahead of time before getting to that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14303)|
| 3:58:27| But in a totally different topic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14307)|
| 3:58:30| and following up a little bit on the earlier point, I have asked –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14310)|
| 3:58:34| and I know you have a tremendous amount on your plate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14314)|
| 3:58:37| but I have asked planning to essentially build a very basic cheat sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14317)|
| 3:58:42| for all zoning-related items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14322)|
| 3:58:45| I'm constantly – when it says, okay, it's two to five units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14325)|
| 3:58:49| I'm scanning the thing, I'm going to KGIS, I'm trying to zoom in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14329)|
| 3:58:53| I'm trying to get a visual of what that looks like from a neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14333)|
| 3:58:56| perspective and what is nine units an acre or one or da-da-da-da.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14336)|
| 3:59:00| And I've asked planning to sort of put together a basic visual cheat sheet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14340)|
| 3:59:03| of, like, here is three examples of a three units an acre and a five units an| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14343)|
| 3:59:07| acre and a 14 unit an acre and a hillside protection and a basic understanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14347)|
| 3:59:12| And I think, given that we have new commissioners coming in in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14352)|
| 3:59:16| I'd love to sort of accelerate that now so that we can have that as part of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14356)|
| 3:59:20| the toolbox because I'd love to be able to quickly flip through and go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14360)|
| 3:59:23| okay, I kind of get what that townhome looks like now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14363)|
| 3:59:26| and I think that would be helpful for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14366)|
| 3:59:28| I know everything is a little bit different, but you had said that you could| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14368)|
| 3:59:31| at least give three or four examples of what something looks like in a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14371)|
| 3:59:35| general sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14375)|
| 3:59:36| Yes, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14376)|
| 3:59:37| And, Commissioner Jay, we have developed what's called a density viewer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14377)|
| 3:59:40| based off of that request that you made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14380)|
| 3:59:44| And I will send that back out to everybody, a link to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14384)|
| 3:59:47| We need to continuously update it, but you can look across the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14387)|
| 3:59:52| and see different types of density and what that looks like locally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14392)|
| 3:59:55| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14395)|
| 3:59:56| Yeah, I remember you did introduce, like, an early version.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14396)|
| 3:59:58| But it would be beneficial probably for us to resend that out because it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14398)|
| 4:00:00| been a while since we had that conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14400)|
| 4:00:02| And I think engineering could add to that of, you know, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14402)|
| 4:00:04| here's what in a subdivision that is required to do a turn lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14404)|
| 4:00:08| basic turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14408)|
| 4:00:09| Here's what that looks like when they're required to do a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14409)|
| 4:00:11| here's a small roundabout, here's a big roundabout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14411)|
| 4:00:13| You know, some of the stuff, I think it's just helpful to see because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14413)|
| 4:00:16| we're trying to, we're doing so much of this on 2D paper, it's difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14416)|
| 4:00:20| So thank you very much for reintroducing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14420)|
| 4:00:23| Commissioner Smith, you're up again, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14423)|
| 4:00:25| Yeah, I'd just like to, you've got to bear in mind that density is very| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14425)|
| 4:00:29| different, you know, three units an acre with 5,000 square foot homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14429)|
| 4:00:33| versus three units an acre with 2,000 square foot homes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14433)|
| 4:00:37| It looks very different from above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14437)|
| 4:00:41| Is there any other, oh, Mr. Snow, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14441)|
| 4:00:44| Chairman, I just wanted to make sure, is your all's preference to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14444)|
| 4:00:50| I think I heard that you guys wanted to defer the PR zone major updates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14450)|
| 4:00:54| until after the comprehensive plan, but I didn't want to, Amy and I were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14454)|
| 4:00:58| talking and we weren't entirely sure, so we wanted to make absolutely sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14458)|
| 4:01:02| that that was your all's preference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14462)|
| 4:01:04| We'll certainly do either, but we just wanted to verify that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14464)|
| 4:01:08| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14468)|
| 4:01:09| Yes, that is the preference, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14469)|
| 4:01:11| We were not going to take any legislative action on that item tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14471)|
| 4:01:14| Okay, good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14474)|
| 4:01:15| Sounds fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14475)|
| 4:01:16| We appreciate your all's support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14476)|
| 4:01:17| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14477)|
| 4:01:18| Commissioner Biggs, I'm sorry, I want to do one more thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14478)|
| 4:01:20| Jim, you know, that pump truck, I feel like, saves some people's lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14480)|
| 4:01:25| And I just wanted to tell you, man, what a great job you're doing over there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14485)|
| 4:01:30| Because I believe it was you that brought that idea for the pump truck to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14490)|
| 4:01:34| So, in turn, that really had a huge impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14494)|
| 4:01:38| We'll take the credit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14498)|
| 4:01:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14499)|
| 4:01:40| You're being too kind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14500)|
| 4:01:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14501)|
| 4:01:47| Is there any other business to come before this commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14507)|
| 4:01:50| Chair wishes to adjourn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14510)|
| 4:01:51| Motion adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14511)|
| 4:01:52| And a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14512)|
| 4:01:53| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14513)|
| 4:01:54| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14514)|
| 4:01:55| Adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14515)|
| 4:02:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-267-220124?start=14520)|
