| 0:13:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| I just wanted to say for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=834)|
| 0:13:57| this is regarding case 45 that was heard on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=837)|
| 0:14:01| And I am pleased with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=841)|
| 0:14:04| I think that it's appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=844)|
| 0:14:06| But I wanted to comment on that particular area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| where that case takes place, which is in the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| It's in South Knoxville around Lancaster.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=855)|
| 0:14:19| There have been new sidewalks that have gone in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=859)|
| 0:14:22| It's right off of James White Parkway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=862)|
| 0:14:24| right around the urban wilderness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=864)|
| 0:14:26| And that area is happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=866)|
| 0:14:28| That's the best way to put it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=868)|
| 0:14:30| And I'm concerned because while this particular item was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=870)|
| 0:14:34| appropriate, there wasn't an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=874)|
| 0:14:36| for a lot of additional, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=876)|
| 0:14:41| community input or oversight in terms of a plan for that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=881)|
| 0:14:46| And I see that as a real need at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=886)|
| 0:14:49| So I'd just like to say for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=889)|
| 0:14:51| and hopefully moving on to council and for planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=891)|
| 0:14:53| that that area, that South Knoxville area that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| is growing so much right now, really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=897)|
| 0:14:58| could benefit from a more macro kind of planning document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=898)|
| 0:15:05| Duly noted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=905)|
| 0:15:06| And I see a lot of heads nodding in agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=906)|

| 0:16:00| This will require two motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=960)|
| 0:16:04| The staff recommendation is to postpone the plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=964)|
| 0:16:07| application to the August 8, 2024 Planning Commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=967)|

| 0:16:21| to the August 8, 2024 Planning Commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=981)|

| 0:16:55| Thunder Mountain Properties, requesting the amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1015)|
| 0:16:59| to the land use designation and a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1019)|
| 0:17:03| The present land use designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1023)|
| 0:17:05| consists of parks and open space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1025)|
| 0:17:08| That's the majority of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1028)|
| 0:17:09| Town center mixed use, and then a small portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1029)|
| 0:17:12| of traditional neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1032)|
| 0:17:14| We're requesting amendment to the land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1034)|
| 0:17:17| designation of the corridor mixed use, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1037)|
| 0:17:21| as you'll see on the map to the east and the southeast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1041)|
| 0:17:25| there is an existing corridor mixed use large area land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1045)|
| 0:17:30| designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1050)|
| 0:17:31| So this would be, in fact, an extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1051)|
| 0:17:32| of that land use designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1052)|
| 0:17:36| The corridor mixed used area is a mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1056)|
| 0:17:41| consisting of commercial, office, residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1061)|
| 0:17:45| It's considered a walkable mixed use development occurring| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1065)|
| 0:17:48| along major corridors, which would be something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1068)|
| 0:17:51| like Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1071)|
| 0:17:54| Changing conditions here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1074)|
| 0:17:57| Suspect the designation on the majority of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| that parks and open space was largely| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1080)|
| 0:18:03| based on this portion of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1083)|
| 0:18:04| being used as a ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1084)|

| 0:18:12| It's meant this destination is no longer appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1092)|
| 0:18:14| Based on the recent announcements Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1094)|
| 0:18:17| that a new Knox County Park is being developed on property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1097)|
| 0:18:20| located nearby directly to the east here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1100)|
| 0:18:24| from here across Sevierville Pike and Balgrove Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1104)|
| 0:18:29| This new park development was made possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1109)|
| 0:18:31| by my client, Thunder Mountain Properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1111)|
| 0:18:33| donation of 107 acres to Legacy Parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1113)|
| 0:18:37| which will then later be conveyed to Knox County Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1117)|
| 0:18:42| There will be, part of this will include the construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1122)|
| 0:18:45| development of brand new ball fields by the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1125)|
| 0:18:48| Parks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1128)|
| 0:18:50| The ball fields that are currently at the existing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1130)|
| 0:18:52| location are dated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1132)|
| 0:18:54| These will be brand new facilities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| on a section of that 107 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1135)|
| 0:18:59| It's about 23 acres of really flat, good usable area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1139)|
| 0:19:05| And again, that announcement of that donation was on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1145)|
| 0:19:10| So it includes ball fields there and some other public amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1150)|
| 0:19:14| as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1154)|
| 0:19:16| The present Bower Fields, they'll| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1156)|
| 0:19:18| continue to be available in the interim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1158)|
| 0:19:21| I know there was a lot of concern on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1161)|
| 0:19:23| There's an existing lease agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1163)|
| 0:19:25| with Knox County for the use of those facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1165)|
| 0:19:29| I think there's approximately 7 and 1 half years remaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1169)|
| 0:19:31| on that lease agreement between my client and Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1171)|
| 0:19:38| Submit that is an error in admission in the plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| In fact, the zoning on the entire frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1181)|
| 0:19:45| of this property, of this portion of this property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1185)|
| 0:19:47| all the way along Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1187)|
| 0:19:51| because this is about 7 acres, is in fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1191)|
| 0:19:53| zone CA, which that's the rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1193)|
| 0:19:55| that we are requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1195)|
| 0:19:58| The CA zoning is not a directly related or partially related| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1198)|
| 0:20:02| zoning designation under the comprehensive land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1202)|
| 0:20:06| plan for either the park and open space designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1206)|
| 0:20:10| the town center mixed use designation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1210)|
| 0:20:12| or the traditional neighborhood designation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| It is an appropriate land use designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| for the corridor mixed use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1216)|
| 0:20:20| Submit that the proposed change to the corridor mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1220)|
| 0:20:24| is supported by the policies and actions, goals, objectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1224)|
| 0:20:27| and criteria of the comprehensive land use plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1227)|
| 0:20:31| The amount of recent rezonings and development plan approvals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1231)|
| 0:20:34| in the area warrant the need for additional commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1234)|
| 0:20:36| development to further economic growth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| in this area of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1240)|
| 0:20:42| The requested amendment aligns with the vision and goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1242)|
| 0:20:47| related to the community care term recreation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1247)|
| 0:20:49| under the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1249)|
| 0:20:51| The corridor mixed use plan designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| aligns with the visions and goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1252)|
| 0:20:54| related to the community character and recreation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1254)|
| 0:20:57| As for the community character component,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1257)|
| 0:20:59| as the corridor mixed use contemplates,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1259)|
| 0:21:02| a mixed use type of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1262)|
| 0:21:05| Also requesting the rezoning to the CA for this portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1265)|
| 0:21:10| Again, as noted, this would be an extension| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| of the general commercial, the CA zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1272)|
| 0:21:16| that's along the frontage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1276)|
| 0:21:20| This property has similar characteristics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1280)|
| 0:21:24| to the considerations that have been applied and recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1284)|
| 0:21:30| by this planning commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1290)|
| 0:21:31| On the property that my client owns across Chapman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1291)|
| 0:21:34| to the south, similar type request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1294)|
| 0:21:36| with the general commercial or the CA on the front portion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1296)|
| 0:21:42| That was recommended for approval by this planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1302)|
| 0:21:44| commission in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1304)|
| 0:21:47| Support for the rezoning is the substantial improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1307)|
| 0:21:51| by TDOT to Chapman Highway, Sevierville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1311)|
| 0:21:53| the infrastructure, utilities, improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1313)|
| 0:21:56| that have been made in the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| With that, we'd request that you approve the land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| designation amendment to corridor mixed use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1320)|
| 0:22:02| as well as rezoning to CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1322)|

| 0:22:20| Seeing no opposition, let's commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| I guess I'll jump out there and start the discussion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1345)|
| 0:22:29| I think we did have a whole lot of discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1349)|
| 0:22:33| about this at the pre-agenda meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1353)|
| 0:22:35| I think the first one is staff was originally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1355)|
| 0:22:39| or is recommending postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1359)|
| 0:22:43| Mike, could you speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1363)|
| 0:22:44| And then I think there'll probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1364)|
| 0:22:46| be some follow-up questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| Because I think we determined in the stat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1368)|
| 0:22:50| or in the pre-agenda meeting that we don't necessarily| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1370)|
| 0:22:54| have to postpone it until next month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1374)|
| 0:22:56| and then it could be read today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1376)|
| 0:23:04| Our recommendation is still to postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1384)|
| 0:23:07| to align with the set schedule for plan amendments in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1387)|
| 0:23:18| Commissioner, would you like me to provide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1398)|
| 0:23:20| a little bit of background on why| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1400)|
| 0:23:23| we recommended postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1403)|
| 0:23:24| Is that what you're asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1404)|
| 0:23:26| Well, just staff's position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1406)|
| 0:23:27| But I think we established that, if memory serves me correctly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1407)|
| 0:23:31| and please correct me if I'm not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| I mean, this application was applied for many months ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1413)|
| 0:23:37| and tabled and then taken off the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1417)|
| 0:23:40| And I understand what your staff's trying to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1420)|
| 0:23:43| is we're trying to align it with the new growth policy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1423)|
| 0:23:46| plan, which would be read next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1426)|
| 0:23:50| However, given the fact that it had already been applied for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1430)|
| 0:23:53| and been on the table and pulled off the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1433)|
| 0:23:55| that we had the ability to read it today if the commission so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1435)|
| 0:24:00| chose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1440)|
| 0:24:01| Is that accurate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1441)|
| 0:24:03| Yes, I would say that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1443)|
| 0:24:06| Yes, to align with the new schedule| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1446)|
| 0:24:09| for the comprehensive plan that was recently adopted in April,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1449)|
| 0:24:13| to the quarterly amendment schedule starts next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1453)|
| 0:24:16| But I'll just reference page 72 in that adopted plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| It says that county commissioner or planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1460)|
| 0:24:23| may initiate plan amendments at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| but consideration of amendments from applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| is to occur quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1467)|
| 0:24:28| And so that is the basis for our recommendation for postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1468)|
| 0:24:32| Yeah, totally understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1472)|
| 0:24:34| But my personal feeling is I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1474)|
| 0:24:39| we need to go ahead and hear it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1479)|
| 0:24:41| I mean, it's not going to make any difference| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1481)|
| 0:24:43| if we postpone a month or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1483)|
| 0:24:46| I think we can have our healthy discussion about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1486)|
| 0:24:50| send up a recommendation to approve or not approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1490)|
| 0:24:53| At that stage, county commission can actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1493)|
| 0:24:56| postpone it if they so choose, if they feel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1496)|
| 0:24:59| like it needs another 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1499)|
| 0:25:00| So that said, Mike, I mean, does the staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1500)|
| 0:25:04| have a basic recommendation that they| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1504)|
| 0:25:07| would have given next month on this file that we can discuss?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1507)|
| 0:25:14| We do have some, I guess, a framework for recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1514)|
| 0:25:19| I would say we haven't had a chance to dive deep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| into the review of this case yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| But we do have a framework for review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1525)|
| 0:25:29| Yeah, if it's OK, if we could hear your thoughts on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1529)|
| 0:25:32| I'd appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1532)|
| 0:25:33| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1533)|
| 0:25:37| So this is approximately 38 acre site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1537)|
| 0:25:41| However, it's not a full site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1541)|
| 0:25:46| We'll not have to have either a plan amendment or rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| So when we look at acreage, just know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| that there is some fluctuation in what we're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1551)|
| 0:25:54| in acreage between the two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1554)|
| 0:25:57| They are asking for the community mixed use place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1557)|
| 0:26:01| type, which allows a mixture of commercial, office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1561)|
| 0:26:05| residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| It's not too dissimilar from the town center mixed use, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1569)|
| 0:26:14| is partly on the property already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1574)|
| 0:26:16| That land use or place type does not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1576)|
| 0:26:18| allow consideration of the requested CA zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1578)|
| 0:26:21| However, so that's why they're requesting that portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1581)|
| 0:26:24| be changed to CMU as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1584)|
| 0:26:30| So you can tell the property has a lot of furniture| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1590)|
| 0:26:33| on Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| It has steep slopes on the northwest side of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1594)|
| 0:26:39| And then as you go back away from Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1599)|
| 0:26:41| it kind of gets skinnier to a point along Evans Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1601)|
| 0:26:45| And there's a, what shows up on a map, it's a blue line stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1605)|
| 0:26:49| I don't know if it's truly a stream| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| or if a study has been done on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| But what staff is recommending is that rather than rezone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1614)|
| 0:26:58| and amend the plan for the entire site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1618)|
| 0:27:01| is to concentrate the amendment to the front portion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1621)|
| 0:27:06| of the property, which then better aligns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1626)|
| 0:27:10| with where residential uses are proposed and existing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1630)|
| 0:27:15| So as you can see on the screen here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1635)|
| 0:27:21| what staff is recommending for the plan amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1641)|
| 0:27:23| is what you see in the cross-hatched area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1643)|
| 0:27:26| So it concentrates the development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1646)|
| 0:27:30| towards Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| It's basically where the blue line stream on the map begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1651)|
| 0:27:35| It's pretty much where we suggest cutting off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1655)|
| 0:27:38| the commercial zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1658)|
| 0:27:41| The back portion of the property, by our recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1661)|
| 0:27:44| would just kind of stay as is today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1664)|
| 0:27:48| And the rezoning pretty much aligns with that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1668)|
| 0:27:51| They already have a strip of CA general business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1671)|
| 0:27:54| on the front of the property, so it'd be just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| extending the CA zoning back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1676)|
| 0:27:59| We are recommending one condition to the CA zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1679)|
| 0:28:03| that there be no grading or building permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1683)|
| 0:28:10| until a development plan is approved by the Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1690)|
| 0:28:13| Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1693)|
| 0:28:13| Particularly the CA zone, a lot of the uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1693)|
| 0:28:16| would just go straight through a permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1696)|
| 0:28:18| So this condition would be to ensure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1698)|
| 0:28:21| that the proposal that is presented in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1701)|
| 0:28:25| aligns with the CMU land use classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| So it's kind of generality of trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1710)|
| 0:28:32| to incorporate the CMU intent into the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1712)|
| 0:28:38| Thank you, Mike, for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1718)|
| 0:28:39| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1719)|
| 0:28:41| Does the attorney, do you have any comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1721)|
| 0:28:45| about what staff is proposing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1725)|
| 0:29:01| I guess not understanding exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1741)|
| 0:29:02| what the condition of the development plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1742)|
| 0:29:06| process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Is it a use on review type approach?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1747)|
| 0:29:12| Or what all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Yeah, the commercial rezoning that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| happened on the south side of Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| which is the same property owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| had the same condition attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1762)|
| 0:29:25| So that's the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| It's not use on review technically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1766)|
| 0:29:27| It's a development plan review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1767)|
| 0:29:29| During development plan review, the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| also can look at adopted plans and recommendations of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| to help guide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| Would that be an administrative type review?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| No, it'd have to come back to the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1780)|
| 0:29:41| just like the condition on the south side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1781)|
| 0:29:53| Let that condition be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1793)|
| 0:30:06| You want to make a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1806)|
| 0:30:08| Or do we have other lines?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| Oh, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1810)|
| 0:30:11| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1811)|
| 0:30:12| These lines are hard to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1812)|
| 0:30:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1814)|
| 0:30:16| I guess, are you willing to postpone and accept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1816)|
| 0:30:20| staff's recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1820)|
| 0:30:28| No, we're asking to go ahead and go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1828)|
| 0:30:30| As Commissioner Huber pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1830)|
| 0:30:32| this was filed and then tabled for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1832)|
| 0:30:35| It's been kind of sitting around for a while| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1835)|
| 0:30:37| and trying to move these forward now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1837)|
| 0:30:42| and not agreeable to the postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| I guess one of the things that I would like personally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1845)|
| 0:30:48| in order to make this decision is I know that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1848)|
| 0:30:51| granted, this is a new plan that we're all trying to work with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1851)|
| 0:30:53| but I know that this is a partially-related use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1853)|
| 0:30:59| within the Corridor Mixed Use, the CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1859)|
| 0:31:02| And part of the description was that we should also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1862)|
| 0:31:06| be reviewing it with a development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1866)|
| 0:31:08| and conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1868)|
| 0:31:09| Were you prepared to present that in order for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1869)|
| 0:31:16| Commissioner Midas, if I'm not misunderstood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1876)|
| 0:31:18| I think that was a condition that he put on it in his motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1878)|
| 0:31:22| that it would come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1885)|
| 0:31:25| Oh, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1885)|
| 0:31:26| Or in the discussion, that was part of the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1886)|
| 0:31:29| When would it come back?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1889)|
| 0:31:31| It would come back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1891)|
| 0:31:33| As a development plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1893)|
| 0:31:34| That's how I understood it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1894)|
| 0:31:35| But it's already going to be already CA at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| Correct, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| So if they wanted to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| before they can move forward with their development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| staff's recommendation is that they come back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| with a development plan that you all would review here first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1905)|
| 0:31:49| But we're having to decide on the CA appropriateness today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1909)|
| 0:31:54| That's what they're requesting, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1914)|
| 0:31:56| I mean, I would prefer a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| I know it's your workflow, it's planning's workflow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1920)|
| 0:32:03| It sounds like it's probably easier for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| That's what staff recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1927)|
| 0:32:09| Commissioner Biggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1929)|
| 0:32:11| I'm also in favor of a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1931)|
| 0:32:12| While I appreciate that this has been in the hopper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1932)|
| 0:32:16| if you will, for a few months, it's a dynamic situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1936)|
| 0:32:19| There was just a major deal announced on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1939)|
| 0:32:22| regarding the donation of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1942)|
| 0:32:24| So it hasn't been a static situation for several months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1944)|
| 0:32:28| It's been evolving and changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| And so I'm in favor of going with staff's recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1949)|
| 0:32:34| postponing for a month, giving the community more time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| to react to the news that was announced on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1956)|
| 0:32:39| if there are additional questions or comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1959)|
| 0:32:41| So I'll be voting in favor of staff's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1961)|
| 0:32:44| Thank you, Commissioner Biggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1964)|
| 0:32:45| Commissioner Higgins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1965)|
| 0:32:47| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1967)|
| 0:32:49| We may have discussed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1969)|
| 0:32:50| And while I was looking through some things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1970)|
| 0:32:52| I might have missed this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1972)|
| 0:32:53| But how did this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1973)|
| 0:32:54| Like, why was this not already put on next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1974)|
| 0:32:58| Because typically, if you apply for this type of change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1978)|
| 0:33:02| it would not be heard until that month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1982)|
| 0:33:05| Why are we wasn't even on this agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1985)|
| 0:33:10| As it was stated, this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1990)|
| 0:33:13| was originally submitted in December of 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| And then it was placed on the table at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=1998)|
| 0:33:21| So at that time, it included a rezoning and a sector plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2001)|
| 0:33:25| amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2005)|
| 0:33:25| So it has been in the queue for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2005)|
| 0:33:29| And the applicant then asked for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2009)|
| 0:33:30| to be removed from the table and to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2010)|
| 0:33:33| And so again, it was caught up in the adoption process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2013)|
| 0:33:37| of this new comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| And so the reason that it has a different file number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| is because we wanted to align it with our new policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2022)|
| 0:33:45| and procedures associated with that new| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| so we can track it better under the new comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2027)|
| 0:33:49| So it has been in the queue for a while.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2029)|
| 0:33:52| And our recommendation was for it to be heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2032)|
| 0:33:53| on the quarterly schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| OK, and that part was, I understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2035)|
| 0:33:57| that part with the back story of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2037)|
| 0:34:00| because I remember it being tabled and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2040)|
| 0:34:02| But I guess when they pulled it off the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2042)|
| 0:34:05| how did it end up on this month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2045)|
| 0:34:09| If you all aren't hearing, or if we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2049)|
| 0:34:12| supposed to be hearing the comprehensive plan changes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2052)|
| 0:34:18| until the right quarterly meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2058)|
| 0:34:21| I don't understand how it ended up still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2061)|
| 0:34:24| Is it something to pulling off table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2064)|
| 0:34:26| like has to be heard within a certain amount of time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2066)|
| 0:34:28| Not that it has to be heard within a certain amount of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2068)|
| 0:34:31| It was, because it was pulled off the table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| it was already in the queue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2073)|
| 0:34:34| So if a new application were to come in, we would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2074)|
| 0:34:37| it came in in May, and they want to be heard for a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2077)|
| 0:34:40| amendment in June, we would say, no, you need to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2080)|
| 0:34:43| But that would be starting from that first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2083)|
| 0:34:46| with the new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2086)|
| 0:34:47| This one had already been in the queue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| So it's a little tricky in that sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2089)|
| 0:34:50| in that it was kind of already in motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2090)|
| 0:34:54| So to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2094)|
| 0:34:56| So it is, the applicant can request for it to be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2096)|
| 0:35:00| So unrelated to this one, if a case is tabled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2100)|
| 0:35:05| let's say it's a sector plan change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| and that should be heard quarterly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| but it gets pulled off table on a random meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2110)|
| 0:35:13| would that also land on a meeting like not on schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2113)|
| 0:35:18| Yes, it could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2118)|
| 0:35:19| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2119)|
| 0:35:24| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2124)|
| 0:35:27| Tagging onto that question, does this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2127)|
| 0:35:31| mean that we're sort of setting a precedent with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2131)|
| 0:35:35| in terms of if we do choose to hear it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2135)|
| 0:35:38| that we've kind of done that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2138)|
| 0:35:40| Or would we have an opportunity today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2140)|
| 0:35:43| by saying that we're going to go with staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2143)|
| 0:35:46| to postpone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2146)|
| 0:35:47| And part of that rationale being that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| want to stay in cycle with this new plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2149)|
| 0:35:52| that that is saying that that's how we want to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2152)|
| 0:35:55| So even if something in the example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| that Commissioner Higgins gave came off table,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| and it could be heard, we would prefer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2162)|
| 0:36:04| it to be heard in the time frame that puts everything together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2164)|
| 0:36:12| If I'm understanding you correctly, so yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2172)|
| 0:36:14| if you wanted, so for instance, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2174)|
| 0:36:15| use the city for an example, because they are already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2175)|
| 0:36:17| on a quarterly schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2177)|
| 0:36:18| If you were to say, we don't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2178)|
| 0:36:19| to hear any cases unless it's on that quarterly schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| So if someone postponed an item,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2182)|
| 0:36:23| they can't be heard until that next quarter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2183)|
| 0:36:25| that next meeting that's set to be heard for plan amendments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| Yes, you can make that request of us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2189)|
| 0:36:30| and we can address it through our policies and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2190)|
| 0:36:35| Am I answering your question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2195)|
| 0:36:36| Yeah, I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2196)|
| 0:36:39| I want to concur with other commissioners, Midas and Biggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2199)|
| 0:36:45| because I do feel like this is not a static situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2205)|
| 0:36:48| I think that's a good word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2208)|
| 0:36:50| It's very dynamic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2210)|
| 0:36:50| A lot of things have been changing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2210)|
| 0:36:51| There's been an announcement just this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2211)|
| 0:36:53| And we've gotten lots of comments from the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2213)|
| 0:36:55| And I feel that at least some of our commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| is saying we would like a little more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2219)|
| 0:37:01| And I hear staff saying we'd like a little more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2221)|
| 0:37:03| I appreciate how prepared Mr. Reynolds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2223)|
| 0:37:06| was to be able to put things up and answer your question,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2226)|
| 0:37:10| Commissioner Hubert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| But I don't feel like we've all had time to really stew on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2231)|
| 0:37:16| So I, too, would be in favor of a postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2236)|
| 0:37:18| And we'll make a motion to go with staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2238)|
| 0:37:21| to postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2241)|
| 0:37:24| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2244)|
| 0:37:25| OK, we have a motion by Commissioner Adams| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2245)|
| 0:37:29| to postpone for staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| seconded by Commissioner Perez.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2251)|
| 0:37:33| Commissioner, let's see, Commissioner Levenson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2253)|
| 0:37:37| I just wanted to make some comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2257)|
| 0:37:39| before we have the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2259)|
| 0:37:42| There has been a lot of work that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2262)|
| 0:37:44| been done on this, especially recently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2264)|
| 0:37:47| Donations, the field issues have been solved, I feel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2267)|
| 0:37:54| Robert Campbell, who is the engineer of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2274)|
| 0:37:57| has identified a substantial piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2277)|
| 0:38:02| flat enough for these ball fields, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2282)|
| 0:38:04| seem to be probably one of the biggest things that we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| Also, that it was told to us, or to me, because I dug deeper,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2289)|
| 0:38:15| that the ball fields will not flood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2295)|
| 0:38:18| which is what some of the people were complaining about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2298)|
| 0:38:22| I read all these, if you can believe that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2302)|
| 0:38:25| someone my age reading all these comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| But then on the way in here, I got| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2307)|
| 0:38:32| caught by Commissioner Frazier, who kind of explained to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2312)|
| 0:38:41| her position on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2321)|
| 0:38:43| And I didn't necessarily disagree with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| And that is, the only condition, if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2325)|
| 0:38:48| were to move forward, which I'd like to see us do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| is that the county be held accountable to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| the fields built in a timely manner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2335)|
| 0:39:00| as part of the motion, so that there would be no interruption| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2340)|
| 0:39:04| on the baseball fields.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2344)|
| 0:39:06| That's the only recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| But I have checked in all of these complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2347)|
| 0:39:12| and found them to have adequate answers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2352)|
| 0:39:16| above adequate answers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2356)|
| 0:39:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2358)|
| 0:39:19| Thank you, Commissioner Levenson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2359)|
| 0:39:22| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2362)|
| 0:39:24| I just wanted to clarify, I think, with my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2364)|
| 0:39:29| And I don't have a strong stance on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2369)|
| 0:39:32| I do think that I would like for staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2372)|
| 0:39:37| to have had the opportunity to write a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2377)|
| 0:39:40| And if there are conditions that we should be adding in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2380)|
| 0:39:44| I would like to have the time and opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2384)|
| 0:39:46| to think through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| So I would be in favor of a postpone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| But I also want to say, when it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2390)|
| 0:39:53| to the question of pulling things off the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2393)|
| 0:39:55| and when they get heard, I don't know how often that happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| I think more so, my question is, if that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2399)|
| 0:40:10| can happen, I guess, well, let me start with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2410)|
| 0:40:15| how often does that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2415)|
| 0:40:16| Has that happened a few times in the past few years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2416)|
| 0:40:19| where we've had a situation like this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| It doesn't happen frequently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| But it does happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2423)|
| 0:40:23| I can't give you the exact number per year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2423)|
| 0:40:25| But it's not every month, obviously.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2425)|
| 0:40:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2427)|
| 0:40:28| I guess, I know that staff, ideally, you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2428)|
| 0:40:30| would hear things, or you all would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2430)|
| 0:40:32| be doing the staff reports at those quarterly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2432)|
| 0:40:36| at the appropriate times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2436)|
| 0:40:37| But in situations with postponements and things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2437)|
| 0:40:39| like that, it doesn't bother me to hear it out of schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2439)|
| 0:40:43| I'm just curious, procedurally, if you all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2443)|
| 0:40:48| are asking for this to be postponed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2448)|
| 0:40:49| is that something that should be written, codified,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2449)|
| 0:40:55| or written into a policy with staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2455)|
| 0:40:59| that situations like this happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2459)|
| 0:41:01| Or is it just, are you all saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2461)|
| 0:41:04| recommending postponement for this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2464)|
| 0:41:06| just because of this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2466)|
| 0:41:08| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| It's because we just recently adopted the comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2471)|
| 0:41:14| and agreed to a quarterly schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2474)|
| 0:41:16| So this is a kind of a specific situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2476)|
| 0:41:21| And that makes me think that more so postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2481)|
| 0:41:26| might be appropriate here, just because this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2486)|
| 0:41:28| is a brand new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2488)|
| 0:41:30| So I think I'll be in support of this motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2490)|
| 0:41:37| VICE CHAIR HUBERT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2497)|
| 0:41:39| Vice Chair Hubert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2499)|
| 0:41:41| Thank you, Chairman Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2501)|
| 0:41:44| And Amy actually read this earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2504)|
| 0:41:46| But this is actually in the comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2506)|
| 0:41:48| use and transportation plan that just got approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| and that we all got a hard copy of on Tuesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| But under section IM.1, modify the process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2514)|
| 0:41:59| for plan amendments to support rezonings, which is exactly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2519)|
| 0:42:02| what we're talking about now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| This gets back to your comment, question, Commissioner Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2524)|
| 0:42:08| I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2528)|
| 0:42:08| It says the county or planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2528)|
| 0:42:10| may initiate plan amendments at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2530)|
| 0:42:14| I mean, that's what we all approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2534)|
| 0:42:16| in the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2536)|
| 0:42:19| They can initiate plan amendments at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2539)|
| 0:42:21| But considerations of amendments from applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2541)|
| 0:42:23| is usually to occur quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| But to me, it's very clear that they intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2545)|
| 0:42:30| it to be allowed to be done any time with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2550)|
| 0:42:35| And I guess I would throw it to legal counsel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2555)|
| 0:42:38| to make a comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2558)|
| 0:42:47| I do think you have some discretion, in particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2567)|
| 0:42:51| because of the procedural history of this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2571)|
| 0:42:54| It initiated back in, as Amy said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2574)|
| 0:42:57| I think it was actually, I think, maybe November or December| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| and it was on table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2580)|
| 0:43:02| Now, I read those sentence that Commissioner Huber just read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2582)|
| 0:43:06| the county or planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2586)|
| 0:43:07| may initiate plan amendments at any time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2587)|
| 0:43:09| But consideration of amendments from applicants| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2589)|
| 0:43:12| is expected to occur quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2592)|
| 0:43:15| I do think that it was pretty clearly anticipated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2595)|
| 0:43:18| that action would be taken quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2598)|
| 0:43:22| That's how I read this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2602)|
| 0:43:23| But I also recognize and understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2603)|
| 0:43:25| that this is a little bit of a unique situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2605)|
| 0:43:27| because this one was on the table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2607)|
| 0:43:31| and it was already in existence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| To your question, Commissioner Adams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| and it's a good one about would we be setting a precedent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2614)|
| 0:43:36| that we don't intend to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2616)|
| 0:43:38| I don't necessarily think that that would be the case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2618)|
| 0:43:40| unless we happen to find another one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| where we were in the same situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| where something was on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| And I don't necessarily see that here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2624)|
| 0:43:46| So I think that you have some discretion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2626)|
| 0:43:48| to do as a body what you would like to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2628)|
| 0:43:50| under these circumstances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2630)|
| 0:43:52| But I do read going forward that while plan amendments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2632)|
| 0:43:57| can be initiated at any time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2637)|
| 0:43:59| it is anticipated that it would be quarterly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| for new amendments to be considered quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2643)|
| 0:44:12| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2652)|
| 0:44:14| I appreciate that legal walkthrough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2654)|
| 0:44:20| And I think while it answers a question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| in terms of how we move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| and how this case could or could not set precedent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| I think I still, well, I know I still favor postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2667)|
| 0:44:31| given the changing circumstances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2671)|
| 0:44:33| and trying to give this body and planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2673)|
| 0:44:37| adequate time to really feel comfortable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2677)|
| 0:44:39| with the decisions that we're making today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2679)|
| 0:44:42| Thank you, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2682)|
| 0:44:44| Councilor Forrester, you have a few seconds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2684)|
| 0:44:46| from your previous talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2686)|
| 0:44:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2689)|
| 0:44:49| In pointing to the land use plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| it does say quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| It does not identify those months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2693)|
| 0:44:54| Again, we were already filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| We removed it in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| I found out, I received an email from staff in early June| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| because we were set to come in June,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| identifying that we would have to come to August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2704)|
| 0:45:07| And then I cited my position against that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2707)|
| 0:45:10| about being filed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2710)|
| 0:45:11| And as Director Brooks mentioned on Tuesday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2711)|
| 0:45:16| that in the city, the one-year plans have always,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2716)|
| 0:45:19| or for a long time, have been heard quarterly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| As long as you file that application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| to meet that quarterly meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2723)|
| 0:45:25| once you come to that quarterly meeting, it can be heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2725)|
| 0:45:28| Either then, it can be postponed for 30 days, 60 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| It doesn't have to get postponed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| to the next quarterly meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| And that is the same situation we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| So in the discussions in June with planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2736)|
| 0:45:40| I agreed to postpone it, to amend the application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2740)|
| 0:45:44| and so staff could re-notice the meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2744)|
| 0:45:47| as to the updated uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2747)|
| 0:45:49| With the full expectation of coming here in July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2749)|
| 0:45:53| and having a fully prepared staff report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| I was shocked kind of last Friday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| that I got a staff report that only said postponement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2758)|
| 0:46:01| and didn't have an analysis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2761)|
| 0:46:03| I mean, it was over 30 to 40 days in between| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| where everything I thought was going forward in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2768)|
| 0:46:12| And so again, my client is kind of being boxed in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2772)|
| 0:46:17| It would be kind of our position| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2777)|
| 0:46:19| in that we should be able to go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2779)|
| 0:46:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2782)|
| 0:46:23| Thank you, Councilor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| And so we have, seeing no other lights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2784)|
| 0:46:27| we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2787)|
| 0:46:29| And that motion is to postpone for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2789)|
| 0:46:33| per staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2793)|
| 0:46:34| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2794)|
| 0:46:35| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2796)|
| 0:46:36| So everybody prepared to vote, overlooking any lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2796)|
| 0:46:39| If not, those in favor of postponement say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2799)|
| 0:46:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2803)|
| 0:46:44| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2804)|

| 0:47:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2859)|
| 0:47:39| Motion fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2859)|
| 0:47:40| Chair will entertain a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2860)|
| 0:47:44| I'll make it a motion to approve corridor mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2864)|
| 0:47:48| place type for the portion of the parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2868)|
| 0:47:53| that Mr. Reynolds has up on the screen currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2873)|
| 0:48:01| I believe we have it in an exhibit B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2881)|
| 0:48:05| So I'll say approve the corridor mixed use place type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2885)|
| 0:48:08| for the portion of the parcel as shown in exhibit B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| because of the changing conditions in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2891)|
| 0:48:14| and because it supports the policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2894)|
| 0:48:15| and actions of the comprehensive plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2895)|
| 0:48:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2898)|
| 0:48:19| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| Okay, we've got a motion to approve the corridor mixed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2900)|
| 0:48:24| as described or defined on exhibit B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2904)|
| 0:48:28| which is posted on the screen and will be submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2908)|
| 0:48:32| And then we have a second by Commissioner Levinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2912)|
| 0:48:36| Did I miss something there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2916)|
| 0:48:38| I think it would be helpful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2918)|
| 0:48:39| to have a little bit of clarification| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| related to the proposed changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2920)|
| 0:48:43| support the policies, action goals and objectives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2923)|
| 0:48:47| Commissioner Huber, are there specific ones| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2927)|
| 0:48:49| that you'd like to call out for the record?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2929)|
| 0:48:53| Well, it's an extension of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| And there's a summary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2937)|
| 0:48:58| Again, I know this is a new plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2938)|
| 0:49:00| So there's a summary of policies and actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| on page 52 and 53, if that's helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2942)|
| 0:49:07| It would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2947)|
| 0:49:08| But I don't know where it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2948)|
| 0:49:10| Give me a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2950)|
| 0:49:36| They're with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2976)|
| 0:49:37| We're working with a new plan here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2977)|
| 0:49:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=2980)|
| 0:50:05| Okay, well, we'll try this again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3005)|
| 0:50:07| I guess I'll just try to name a few of them off| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3007)|
| 0:50:12| out of the policies and actions section on page 52.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3012)|
| 0:50:16| But I would motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3016)|
| 0:50:18| the corridor mixed use place type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3018)|
| 0:50:19| for this portion of the parcel shown in exhibit B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3019)|
| 0:50:22| because of the changes and conditions in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3022)|
| 0:50:25| and because it supports the policies and actions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3025)|
| 0:50:27| of the comprehensive plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3027)|
| 0:50:28| including but not limited to number four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3028)|
| 0:50:31| incentivizing walkable mixed use centers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3031)|
| 0:50:33| corridors and neighborhood service nodes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3033)|
| 0:50:36| as a preferred form of commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3036)|
| 0:50:39| Also to encourage number 16,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3039)|
| 0:50:42| encourage coordination amongst economic development partners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3042)|
| 0:50:47| That whole area is primed for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3047)|
| 0:50:50| Number 17, support opportunities for innovation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3050)|
| 0:50:52| and growth of our local economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3052)|
| 0:50:56| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3056)|
| 0:50:57| Okay, so we've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| Seconded, a motion by Vice Chair Heber,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3062)|
| 0:51:05| seconded by Commissioner Levinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3065)|
| 0:51:07| Are we clear on what we're voting on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| Everybody says yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| Commissioner Perez, do you have?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3071)|
| 0:51:14| Okay, Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3074)|
| 0:51:17| Okay, so we're voting on the sector plan, the CA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3077)|
| 0:51:22| Again, Mike, can you kind of go over| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| your recommendation once again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| So for the plan amendment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3089)|
| 0:51:36| So we are supportive of the idea| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| of the commercial mixed use on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3100)|
| 0:51:42| It's an extension of the existing place type in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| The rationale for the area that we're recommending approval on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3107)|
| 0:51:52| is that it does not then extend the commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3112)|
| 0:51:58| like the community mixed use further back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3118)|
| 0:52:02| into a more residential setting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3122)|
| 0:52:04| because they are seeking residential rezonings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3124)|
| 0:52:09| kind of flanking both sides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3129)|
| 0:52:11| of the triangular rear portion of the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3131)|
| 0:52:14| So it does not seem appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3134)|
| 0:52:17| to extend the commercial land use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3137)|
| 0:52:19| or place type further back onto the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| There's also some potential stream issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| to deal with there, but the main part of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3144)|
| 0:52:28| is trying to keep the potential commercial activity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3148)|
| 0:52:33| closer to Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3153)|
| 0:52:35| And that would be limited to that cross-hatched area there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3155)|
| 0:52:45| Correct, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3165)|
| 0:52:49| Any other comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3169)|
| 0:52:51| We have Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3171)|
| 0:52:53| Does this include everything that you were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3173)|
| 0:52:56| with, yeah, or is that for the county next month?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3176)|
| 0:53:02| Is that something that, but right now we.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3182)|
| 0:53:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| Yeah, we typically wouldn't make a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3194)|
| 0:53:15| on a plan amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3195)|
| 0:53:17| We do it when I'm rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3197)|
| 0:53:18| Yeah, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3198)|
| 0:53:21| All right, so this is a plan amendment vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3201)|
| 0:53:23| Everybody clear on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| CMU, that's what we're voting on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| on that restrict the cross-hatched area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3208)|
| 0:53:34| Okay, all in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3214)|
| 0:53:36| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3216)|
| 0:53:37| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3217)|
| 0:53:38| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3218)|
| 0:53:42| Okay, Chair will entertain a motion on the.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3222)|
| 0:53:46| I'll start this and then toss to Commissioner Levinson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3226)|
| 0:53:51| But I would motion to approve CA General Business Zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3231)|
| 0:53:54| for the portion of the parcel presented in Exhibit C now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3234)|
| 0:53:59| which is the same hatched area discussed earlier| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3239)|
| 0:54:05| because it is an extension of CA zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3245)|
| 0:54:07| and consistent with the recommended place type| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3247)|
| 0:54:10| subject to two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| One condition is before grading and permits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3253)|
| 0:54:16| are issued on the site, the development plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3256)|
| 0:54:19| by the planning, or a development plan approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3259)|
| 0:54:22| by the Planning Commission is required| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3262)|
| 0:54:24| to ensure consistency with the intent of the CMU place type.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| And then Commissioner Levinson wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3270)|
| 0:54:31| The second condition would be that the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| would be responsible to build the fields| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3273)|
| 0:54:38| within a timely manner before they ever shut down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| any other fields, and it would be a county responsibility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3281)|
| 0:54:46| County parks, is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3286)|
| 0:54:50| I'm not sure, I think it's aspirational| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3290)|
| 0:54:55| which is nice, but I'm not sure that you can impose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3295)|
| 0:54:59| that type of condition on an applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3299)|
| 0:55:03| I will take that off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| That was requested by one of the Knox County Commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3304)|
| 0:55:07| on my way in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| And they can address that when it gets up there, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| I'll let her do it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3312)|
| 0:55:13| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3313)|
| 0:55:15| Yeah, okay, so we've got a motion by Vice Chair Huber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3315)|
| 0:55:20| to approve CA with one condition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3320)|
| 0:55:23| and that is that we, this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| would approve the development plan, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3327)|
| 0:55:31| Okay. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3332)|
| 0:55:36| Rezoning, CA, here we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3338)|
| 0:55:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3339)|
| 0:55:40| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3340)|
| 0:55:41| Motion carries, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3341)|
| 0:55:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3351)|
| 0:56:16| Next on the agenda is item 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3376)|
| 0:56:18| The applicant is Benjamin C. Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3378)|
| 0:56:21| Location, north side of Governor John Speer Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3381)|
| 0:56:24| west Governor John Speer Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3384)|
| 0:56:26| west of West Dick Ford Lane, 9.99 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3386)|
| 0:56:31| Present zoning is low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3391)|
| 0:56:34| Zoning requested is planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3394)|
| 0:56:37| Existing land use is agricultural, forestry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3397)|
| 0:56:39| and vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3399)|
| 0:56:41| Density proposed, 12 dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3401)|
| 0:56:44| Staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3404)|
| 0:56:46| Approve the planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3406)|
| 0:56:48| with a density of up to eight dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| because it is consistent with the comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3411)|
| 0:56:54| and surrounding conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3414)|
| 0:56:56| subject to the two noted conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3416)|
| 0:57:01| I see the applicant is present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3421)|
| 0:57:03| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3423)|
| 0:57:05| And do we have opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| Okay, nobody signed up to speak in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3429)|
| 0:57:12| so Councilor Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3432)|
| 0:57:15| Yes, again, Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3435)|
| 0:57:17| here for the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3437)|
| 0:57:19| We had originally asked to rezone this parcel,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3439)|
| 0:57:22| approximately 10 acres, to PR at 12 dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3442)|
| 0:57:27| Staff's recommendation was PR at eight dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3447)|
| 0:57:30| We were completely fine with what staff has recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3450)|
| 0:57:33| At the eight dwelling units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3453)|
| 0:57:35| we're still working through our development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3455)|
| 0:57:38| as to what this may look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3458)|
| 0:57:40| There are some environmental constraints on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3460)|
| 0:57:43| There's a blue line stream that also corresponds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3463)|
| 0:57:44| with a power line utility easement there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| kind of on the southeast corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3468)|
| 0:57:52| And the two conditions that are in place are statutory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3472)|
| 0:57:56| Essentially, there's a, it's on the scenic highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3476)|
| 0:58:00| John Sevier Highway is on the state scenic highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3480)|
| 0:58:04| So you have to have a 35-foot height limitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3484)|
| 0:58:07| which I think is pretty common for the PR zone anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| within 1,000 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3490)|
| 0:58:11| We're okay with that condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| As well as the buffer zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3494)|
| 0:58:16| 50-foot non-disturbance buffer zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3496)|
| 0:58:18| on the John Sevier Highway corridor study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3498)|
| 0:58:20| that was implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3500)|
| 0:58:21| I did have a conversation with a representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3501)|
| 0:58:24| of some of the neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3504)|
| 0:58:26| They don't have the three homes there behind the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3506)|
| 0:58:31| They don't have sewer, and they're asking if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3511)|
| 0:58:35| as part of this development process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3515)|
| 0:58:36| we could extend sewer to their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3516)|
| 0:58:39| We're looking at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3519)|
| 0:58:39| We're trying to get some more information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3519)|
| 0:58:41| from the utility companies as far as doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3521)|
| 0:58:42| But that looks like it's feasible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3522)|
| 0:58:44| just we can't commit to that right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3524)|
| 0:58:46| because we don't have everything fully worked out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3526)|
| 0:58:49| But with that, we would ask that you approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3529)|

| 0:59:03| because it is consistent with the comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3543)|
| 0:59:06| and surrounding conditions, subject to two conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3546)|

| 0:59:32| You wanna say something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3572)|
| 0:59:33| I was just gonna add that I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3573)|
| 0:59:35| the higher density could be appropriate here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| just because it's on John Speer Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3578)|
| 0:59:41| but applicants are all right with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3581)|
| 0:59:45| and so I didn't expect that to change the motion, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| Okay, all right, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3588)|

| 1:00:28| with up to three dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| because it is consistent with the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3631)|

| 1:00:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3657)|
| 1:01:01| Hey, Scott Davis, PO Box 11315, Knoxville 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3661)|
| 1:01:06| I appreciate all this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3666)|
| 1:01:08| We went before TDCDA on Monday, to be heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| and Commissioner Frazier sits on TDCDA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3672)|
| 1:01:15| and made a motion and recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| to approve up to five dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3677)|
| 1:01:19| because of where it's located, not Pellissippi,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| under one condition, that we would get with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| Knox County Engineering and agree to widen| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3684)|
| 1:01:26| George Light Road from our property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3686)|
| 1:01:28| down to the subdivision below us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3688)|
| 1:01:31| which is Beaver Glade Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3691)|
| 1:01:34| And that was approved at TDCDA on Monday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3694)|
| 1:01:36| so I respect the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3696)|
| 1:01:38| approve that five dwelling units per acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| because it is consistent, and there's five dwelling units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3701)|
| 1:01:43| per acre almost directly across the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3703)|
| 1:01:45| there's apartments right down the road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| so I respect the request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3708)|
| 1:01:49| and I approve for five units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3709)|
| 1:01:53| Ms. Warner, would you like to comment on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3713)|
| 1:01:59| Yes, so the condition was to widen George Light Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3719)|
| 1:02:04| to 20 feet on the entirety of the property's frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3724)|
| 1:02:09| all the way to Beaver Glade Lane,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3729)|
| 1:02:12| and the staff recommendation did not include any conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3732)|
| 1:02:16| but was PR up to three, if you have any.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3736)|
| 1:02:24| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3744)|
| 1:02:28| Commissioner Midas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| Can we add that as a condition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3750)|
| 1:02:34| Yes, that was the recommendation to this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3754)|
| 1:02:38| So it will be added as a condition when we approve it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| No, you would have to, or someone would have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| I guess I'd like to add that as a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3763)|
| 1:02:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3766)|
| 1:02:46| So I'll go ahead and make a motion to approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3766)|
| 1:02:50| per staff's recommendation, including one condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3770)|
| 1:02:53| that the, which were the dwelling, what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3773)|
| 1:02:59| So are you recommending three or five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| Let me just be clear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3782)|
| 1:03:02| So staff recommended three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3782)|
| 1:03:03| but the TTCDA recommended five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3783)|
| 1:03:05| with the condition that the road improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3785)|
| 1:03:07| Five conditions total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3789)|
| 1:03:09| And the applicant's agreeable to all five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| No, no, no, five units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3791)|
| 1:03:13| Five, oh, I'm sorry, yes, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3793)|
| 1:03:15| Yes, let's approve five dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3795)|
| 1:03:18| with one condition that the road will be widened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3798)|
| 1:03:22| From their northern, North Carolina, George Light Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3802)|
| 1:03:26| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| Per say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3808)|
| 1:03:29| TTCDA, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| Is that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3810)|
| 1:03:32| You could also simply say per TTCDA's recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| Per TTCDA's T recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| Not which, I'm not sure which is easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3817)|
| 1:03:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3819)|
| 1:03:40| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3820)|
| 1:03:41| Either way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3821)|
| 1:03:42| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| Okay, can we get a second on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| Okay, we got a motion from Commissioner Midas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3825)|
| 1:03:49| to approve five dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3829)|
| 1:03:51| with one condition from TTCDA| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3831)|
| 1:03:56| related to the road improvement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| seconded by Commissioner Levenson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3838)|
| 1:04:01| Did I get that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3841)|
| 1:04:02| Okay, now before we go to a vote, Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3842)|
| 1:04:07| Yeah, I have a question about just that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| because I'm not sure that I've seen this before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| in terms of staff recommending one thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3853)|
| 1:04:18| a different body saying something else,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3858)|
| 1:04:20| and then that being introduced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| after we've gotten staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3863)|
| 1:04:26| and thus changing that on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3866)|
| 1:04:27| So I'm just curious about that process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| and then the organization, whose acronym,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3869)|
| 1:04:32| I'm not gonna try and say what that specific role is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3872)|
| 1:04:36| with this, just to learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| Sure, I can speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3878)|
| 1:04:39| So it's the Tennessee Technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3879)|
| 1:04:40| Corridor Development Authority, so TTCDA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3880)|
| 1:04:43| So anywhere you have a technology overlay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3883)|
| 1:04:45| that's the board that sort of oversees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| all the rezonings, development plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3888)|
| 1:04:50| and things like that in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3890)|
| 1:04:51| Their vote is one of recommendation to this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3891)|
| 1:04:54| and then your vote is one of recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3894)|
| 1:04:56| to county, commission, and city council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3896)|
| 1:04:57| So it kind of works the same way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3897)|
| 1:04:59| So they met on Monday and agreed to that five| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3899)|
| 1:05:03| with the condition, we did not change our staff report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3903)|
| 1:05:06| in hindsight, maybe we should have to kind of clarify| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| or maybe add a blurb to it so that you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3908)|
| 1:05:10| could have something to look at making your motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3910)|
| 1:05:13| but you could adopt that motion if you'd like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3913)|
| 1:05:17| instead of staff's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3917)|
| 1:05:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3920)|
| 1:05:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3922)|
| 1:05:23| We ready to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3923)|
| 1:05:26| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3926)|
| 1:05:28| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3928)|

| 1:06:10| per acre because it is consistent with the Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3970)|
| 1:06:13| comprehensive plan and surrounding development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3973)|

| 1:06:25| All right, seeing no opposition, would you like to proceed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3985)|
| 1:06:30| Yeah, Scott Davis, PO Box 11315,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| Knoxville, Tennessee 37939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3992)|
| 1:06:34| I appreciate y'all's time again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3994)|
| 1:06:35| Just help me understand, because all this is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3995)|
| 1:06:38| all these nuances and place types and all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=3998)|
| 1:06:40| I've been doing this for 25 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4000)|
| 1:06:42| I'm more confused now than I've,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| I'm older, but I'm a lot more confused than I've ever been.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4004)|
| 1:06:47| So help me understand, with this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| with the planned growth area, where it's located,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| why you get knocked down from five to four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4014)|
| 1:06:59| which I don't understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4019)|
| 1:07:01| So is there any way, it's probably something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4021)|
| 1:07:03| I should have asked prior to with staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4023)|
| 1:07:05| and I can follow up with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4025)|
| 1:07:06| We're fine with four units an acre,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4026)|
| 1:07:07| but at some point I want to try to understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4027)|
| 1:07:10| why or the rationale behind going from one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4030)|
| 1:07:15| density to another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4035)|
| 1:07:17| I think Director Brooks might want,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4037)|
| 1:07:19| you want to speak to this, or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4039)|
| 1:07:21| I mean, if you are okay with our recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4041)|
| 1:07:23| I'd be happy to sit down with you, Mr. Davis,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4043)|
| 1:07:25| and talk to you about how we do our reviews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4045)|
| 1:07:28| We just went over that on Tuesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| with the planning commissioners as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| So just to clarify how we approach that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| I would really appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4054)|

| 1:08:59| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4139)|
| 1:09:03| Here on behalf of the applicant property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| under Thunder Mountain Properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| this property is located in close proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4146)|
| 1:09:09| to the prior agenda item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4149)|
| 1:09:14| This request is for a rezoning from agricultural| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4154)|
| 1:09:17| to planned residential up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4157)|
| 1:09:22| The property's located within the planned growth area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4162)|
| 1:09:25| of the growth policy plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4165)|
| 1:09:28| which does allow for the requested density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4168)|
| 1:09:32| of up to five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4172)|
| 1:09:34| Land use destination for the property, suburban residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4174)|
| 1:09:38| The suburban residential identifies planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4178)|
| 1:09:41| as being an appropriate partially related zoning designation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4181)|
| 1:09:45| at the requested density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4185)|
| 1:09:49| As support for the incident request,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| there have been several recent rezoning approvals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4192)|
| 1:09:56| development plan approvals in the immediate vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| There's 117 lot townhouse development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4198)|
| 1:10:01| at 9.46 dwelling units per acre along Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4201)|
| 1:10:05| Rezoning a planned residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4205)|
| 1:10:07| up to five dwelling units per acre| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4207)|
| 1:10:08| on the southeast side of Chapman Highway from this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| Again, that was a five dwelling units an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4213)|
| 1:10:15| Also on the southeast side of Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4215)|
| 1:10:17| rezoning to commercial as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4217)|
| 1:10:23| Again, there's been several development plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4223)|
| 1:10:28| that have come through recently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4228)|
| 1:10:29| that are on the agenda to come through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4229)|
| 1:10:32| What's helped support these rezoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4232)|
| 1:10:35| and these development plan approvals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4235)|
| 1:10:37| is the substantial infrastructure completion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4237)|
| 1:10:41| by TDOT to Chapman Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4241)|
| 1:10:44| where they widened Chapman Highway, provided turn lanes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4244)|
| 1:10:48| There was also improvements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4248)|
| 1:10:49| to the intersection with Sevierville Pike,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4249)|
| 1:10:52| the improvements to Simpson Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4252)|
| 1:10:54| Those have all spurred a lot of these rezoning requests| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4254)|
| 1:10:58| and development plan submittals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| and kind of the desirability of this area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4261)|
| 1:11:03| is becoming extremely popular, is in high demand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4263)|
| 1:11:08| Again, with the new park location,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4268)|
| 1:11:12| the 107 acres worth of public property consisting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4272)|
| 1:11:18| that'll be the Knox County Public Parks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4278)|
| 1:11:22| that's located, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4282)|
| 1:11:23| directly to the east of this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4283)|
| 1:11:27| Those are what make these rezonings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4287)|
| 1:11:29| to plan residential at certain densities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4289)|
| 1:11:33| That's what makes sense| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4293)|
| 1:11:34| and that's what's contemplated in our zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4294)|
| 1:11:37| That's a built-in instant amenity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4297)|
| 1:11:41| It was announced at the announcement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4301)|
| 1:11:43| for the donation on Monday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4303)|
| 1:11:46| by Carol Evans with Legacy Parks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4306)|
| 1:11:48| just how in demand houses are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| and being located next to a public park,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4311)|
| 1:11:55| the benefits that come with those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4315)|
| 1:11:56| not only to the residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4316)|
| 1:11:58| but the values to the homeowners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4318)|
| 1:12:01| as far as the equity in this house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4321)|
| 1:12:02| I think she cited that it would increase| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4322)|
| 1:12:04| up to 50% of the value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| But again, by the submit that there is support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4326)|
| 1:12:09| there is grounds under the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4329)|

| 1:12:22| recommended by staff as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4342)|
| 1:12:24| It's, I think, one of those conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4344)|
| 1:12:26| I think Commissioner Higgins brought up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4346)|
| 1:12:28| that it was similar to one last month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4348)|
| 1:12:30| about the hillside and that's acceptable to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4350)|

| 1:14:13| This will require, looks like two variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4453)|
| 1:14:20| Oh yeah, and five motions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4460)|
| 1:14:23| But two variances, looks like seven alternative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4463)|
| 1:14:27| design standards that require Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4467)|

| 1:14:40| requiring Knox County Engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4480)|

| 1:14:49| the requested variance to reduce the minimum intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4489)|
| 1:14:52| spacing along Mayerville Pike between the center lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4492)|

| 1:15:02| Variance number, let's see, let's see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4502)|
| 1:15:05| Do I need to spell out the variances?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4505)|
| 1:15:08| You will have to at the time of the meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4508)|
| 1:15:11| Well, let's get it out of the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4511)|
| 1:15:12| Yeah, let's just do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4512)|
| 1:15:13| Variance one required is we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4513)|
| 1:15:18| A, the site steep topography on Mayerville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4518)|
| 1:15:21| frontage of the property limits options for access placement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4521)|
| 1:15:25| B, mill branch stream is between the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4525)|
| 1:15:29| and Mayerville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4529)|
| 1:15:30| Moving the access point will require constructing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4530)|
| 1:15:33| a new stream crossing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4533)|
| 1:15:34| And C, granting of the variation will not be detrimental| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4534)|
| 1:15:39| to public safety, health, or welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4539)|
| 1:15:41| because according to the Mayerville Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4541)|
| 1:15:44| subdivision transportation impact study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4544)|
| 1:15:46| these offset intersections will not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| any conflicting movements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4549)|
| 1:15:51| We'll have low turning movements from each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4551)|
| 1:15:54| and vehicle queues are not expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4554)|
| 1:15:56| to impact operations at either intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4556)|
| 1:16:02| Please bear with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4562)|
| 1:16:03| We have more to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4563)|
| 1:16:05| Motion number two, staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4565)|
| 1:16:06| Approve the requested variance to reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4566)|
| 1:16:08| the minimum vertical curve K value on road A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| at STA 62 plus 69.22 from 25 to 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4571)|
| 1:16:18| Variance two, we have three of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4578)|
| 1:16:22| A is due to the topographic conditions on the subject site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| The reduced K value will allow the future connection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4586)|
| 1:16:29| to the adjacent property to follow better the shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| and slope of the existing site conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| B, the existing topographic conditions of the site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4595)|
| 1:16:39| were not created by any person having an interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4599)|
| 1:16:41| in the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4601)|
| 1:16:43| And C, the granting of the variation will not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| detrimental to public safety, health, or welfare| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| because this segment of road A will function similarly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4608)|
| 1:16:52| to a non-continuous leg of T intersection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4612)|
| 1:16:56| which allows a K value of 15 at the intersection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4616)|
| 1:17:00| Motion three, staff recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4620)|
| 1:17:02| Approve the alternative design standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4622)|
| 1:17:04| based on the justification provided by the applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4624)|

| 1:17:09| of Engineering and Public Works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4629)|
| 1:17:11| Motion four, approve the concept plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4631)|

| 1:17:42| is consistent with the agreed upon zoning and density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4662)|
| 1:17:47| We've worked with staff to work out all the geometry,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4667)|
| 1:17:50| lot layouts, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4670)|

| 1:18:27| Related to, approve the requested variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4707)|
| 1:18:31| You'll need to make steps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4711)|
| 1:18:32| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4712)|
| 1:18:33| Yeah, I knew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4713)|
| 1:18:35| So the first one is to approve the recommended variance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| to reduce the minimum intersection spacing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| along Mandarin Pike between the center lines| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4719)|

| 1:21:24| on behalf of Mr. Wells.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4884)|
| 1:21:26| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4886)|
| 1:21:28| We do have opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4888)|
| 1:21:29| Would you like to proceed or defer, Mr. Campbell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4889)|
| 1:21:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4891)|
| 1:21:33| If the opposition will come before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4893)|
| 1:21:35| and state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4895)|
| 1:21:47| My name is Steve Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4907)|
| 1:21:49| I live at 5309 Fountaingate Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4909)|
| 1:21:53| adjacent to the Sharp property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4913)|
| 1:21:55| which is adjacent to the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| We were not made aware of this approval and everything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4918)|
| 1:22:04| and we received the brunt of the stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4924)|
| 1:22:07| that crosses the Sharp property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4927)|
| 1:22:09| and comes across the back of Fountaingate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4929)|
| 1:22:11| We submitted some photos that show the water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4931)|
| 1:22:15| that does cross there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4935)|
| 1:22:16| And even though Amanda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4936)|
| 1:22:22| sorry, I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| Amanda Perkey and Alistair McLeod| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| both say they meet the current stormwater conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4949)|
| 1:22:34| we would like some time to at least get more evaluation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4954)|
| 1:22:38| on what happens if there is more stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| that comes through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4963)|
| 1:22:47| We will take that into consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4967)|
| 1:22:50| All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4970)|
| 1:22:50| Thank you. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4970)|
| 1:22:52| Would County Engineering have any comment related to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4972)|
| 1:22:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4977)|
| 1:22:58| Mr. Campbell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4978)|
| 1:23:04| I very much appreciate the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4984)|
| 1:23:05| because we are also the recipient of that same water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4985)|
| 1:23:08| and that's why you see the huge drainage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4988)|
| 1:23:11| and utility easement that goes through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4991)|
| 1:23:13| There are approximately 200 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4993)|
| 1:23:16| that drains through that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4996)|
| 1:23:18| downstream towards Tazewell Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| And again, that's one of the reasons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5001)|
| 1:23:22| that we have three 42-inch HDPE pipes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5002)|
| 1:23:25| that we would prefer not to have to put in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5005)|
| 1:23:28| but we are having to put those in there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| to make sure the water is conveyed properly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5010)|
| 1:23:32| I believe the county has probably done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5012)|
| 1:23:35| a couple different studies in that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5015)|
| 1:23:39| on different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5019)|
| 1:23:40| I think that's fair to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| We originally had a plan approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| that was 26, I believe, condo lots in this subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5024)|
| 1:23:50| And right now we've choked it down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5030)|
| 1:23:53| to four single-family homes that we believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| is obviously a much, much better use of the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5036)|
| 1:24:00| from any kind of drainage standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5040)|
| 1:24:03| And we understand the concerns that are there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5043)|
| 1:24:09| but our position is those concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5049)|
| 1:24:12| are caused by the huge amount of water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5052)|
| 1:24:14| that comes through our site| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5054)|
| 1:24:17| that we really don't have any means to control that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5057)|
| 1:24:25| So we would just ask for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5065)|
| 1:24:27| And again, but understanding the situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5067)|
| 1:24:30| the downstream folks are in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5070)|
| 1:24:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5073)|
| 1:24:34| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5074)|
| 1:24:36| I guess I can talk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5076)|
| 1:24:38| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5078)|
| 1:24:40| I just have a question about the structure on 4R3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5080)|
| 1:24:47| Is that, can I use that as a reference point?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5087)|
| 1:24:49| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5089)|
| 1:24:51| Because the accessory structure on the drawings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5091)|
| 1:24:56| appears larger than the primary residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5096)|
| 1:24:59| but I just wanted you to confirm that that is true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5099)|
| 1:25:02| The primary residence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| but I just wanted you to confirm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| that that is or is not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5105)|
| 1:25:07| It probably, it's a barn of some sort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5107)|
| 1:25:10| Okay, like a garage barn, kids hit baseball inside,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5110)|
| 1:25:15| whatever they're gonna do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5115)|
| 1:25:17| And that's becoming a little bit more common now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5117)|
| 1:25:20| The play area is a little bit bigger than the main house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| So that's kind of what that structure is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5123)|
| 1:25:29| Is this Mike's case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5129)|
| 1:25:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5131)|
| 1:25:32| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5132)|
| 1:25:33| In the gender review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5133)|
| 1:25:34| that was something that was discussed about this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5134)|
| 1:25:38| that the accessory structure is supposed to be smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5138)|
| 1:25:42| than the primary structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5142)|
| 1:25:45| And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| Yeah, there's two conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| that are kind of more unique in this one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5152)|
| 1:25:56| at least what staff is recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5156)|
| 1:25:58| First one is pretty obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5158)|
| 1:25:59| It's pretty obvious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5159)|
| 1:26:00| I don't think it's gonna be anything of concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5160)|
| 1:26:02| that the property not be used in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5162)|
| 1:26:05| for commercial, used commercially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5165)|
| 1:26:08| except for the approved home occupations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5168)|
| 1:26:11| Obviously the homeowner themselves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| can have any type of personal work vehicles,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5173)|
| 1:26:16| but that's, it's not supposed to be a commercial property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5176)|
| 1:26:19| And another reason why we, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| mentioning this is because of the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5182)|
| 1:26:23| of the accessory structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5183)|
| 1:26:24| It can sometimes turn into something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5184)|
| 1:26:28| that is not really intended to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5188)|
| 1:26:30| So to help with enforcement in the future, if needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5190)|
| 1:26:33| The floor, and then the next one was the floor area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5193)|
| 1:26:35| of individual accessory structure should not exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5195)|
| 1:26:38| the conditioned floor area of the house on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5198)|
| 1:26:41| And the PR zone is a residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5201)|
| 1:26:45| It doesn't allow commercial uses outside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5205)|
| 1:26:49| of what is considered a home occupation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5209)|
| 1:26:51| and accessory structures are to be secondary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| to the primary use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5215)|
| 1:26:56| So it just needs to be compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5216)|
| 1:27:00| with the residential use in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5220)|
| 1:27:05| and be consistent with the planned residential zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5225)|
| 1:27:10| There's nothing in the residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5230)|
| 1:27:13| that would technically prohibit a larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5233)|
| 1:27:19| accessory structure, but the accessory uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| are to be secondary to the primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| And once it gets larger than the primary use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5243)|
| 1:27:25| I think it's kind of out of compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| with what the intent of the zoning code is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| So said back to you in layperson language,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5251)|
| 1:27:36| this is an okay occurrence of the accessory structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| being slightly larger because it is still| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| an auxiliary usage, it's not the primary usage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| You know, I'm not sure what the square footage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5269)|
| 1:27:51| of the house ultimately will be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5271)|
| 1:27:53| but that's the point of the condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5273)|
| 1:27:55| is to make sure that it stays within reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5275)|
| 1:27:59| yeah, residential character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5279)|
| 1:28:01| Okay, that's what I was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5281)|
| 1:28:02| And Commissioner, our understanding was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5282)|
| 1:28:03| it was a square footage of the house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5283)|
| 1:28:05| which is gonna be, the barn is basically one story| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5285)|
| 1:28:08| where the house will be two stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5288)|
| 1:28:09| So when you take that square footage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| and I forget exactly what the number is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| but it's fairly good size of main residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5294)|
| 1:28:19| I just wanted to follow up on that particular question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5299)|
| 1:28:23| I do appreciate the latest proposal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| that is coming before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5306)|
| 1:28:29| Last year Huber.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5309)|
| 1:28:30| Mr. Campbell, I have a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5310)|
| 1:28:33| It looks like on your plan that you turned in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5313)|
| 1:28:37| am I reading it correctly that the driveways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5317)|
| 1:28:40| will be impervious or they'll be pervious?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5320)|
| 1:28:44| I can't read that myself, but I think we will,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5324)|
| 1:28:47| I think they are, part of that will be impervious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5327)|
| 1:28:50| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5330)|
| 1:28:50| That we get below the threshold of 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5330)|
| 1:28:55| I believe that is the intent of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5335)|
| 1:28:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5337)|
| 1:28:58| Yeah, I mean, per the legend on the side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5338)|
| 1:29:02| it looks like all the driveways are gonna be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5342)|
| 1:29:05| of some sort of pervious pavers or pervious concrete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| I think that's important to talk about with the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5348)|
| 1:29:12| in the sense of, I understand fully what you're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5352)|
| 1:29:14| is there's 200 acres that are draining directly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| across this property and also draining down there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5356)|
| 1:29:21| but with the addition of four lots| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5361)|
| 1:29:24| and going to the effort of using pervious pavers there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5364)|
| 1:29:29| I think that's a big hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5369)|
| 1:29:33| Just if you would, just work with the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5373)|
| 1:29:36| with respect to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5376)|
| 1:29:38| But with that, I think it's appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5378)|
| 1:29:39| and I'd like to move, if I can get back up here to it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5379)|
| 1:29:44| to approve the development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5384)|
| 1:29:49| for four single family residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5389)|
| 1:29:51| as depicted on the site plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5391)|
| 1:29:52| subject to the four conditions listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5392)|
| 1:29:56| We have a motion by Vice Chair Huber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5396)|
| 1:29:58| to approve for staff recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5398)|
| 1:30:00| and seconded by Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5402)|
| 1:30:04| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5404)|
| 1:30:04| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5404)|
| 1:30:05| Motion carries, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5405)|
| 1:30:06| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5406)|
| 1:30:14| I think that's quite a few,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5414)|
| 1:30:15| so I'm not sure if that's enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5415)|
| 1:30:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5417)|
| 1:30:28| On to agenda item 31.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5428)|
| 1:30:30| Applicant, Tommy Hunt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5430)|
| 1:30:32| Location, northeast side of Concord Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5432)|
| 1:30:34| north side of 2nd Drive, 4.69 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5434)|
| 1:30:41| Zoning is neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5441)|
| 1:30:44| Existing land use, agricultural, forestry, and vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5444)|
| 1:30:47| Proposed use is a fueling station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5447)|
| 1:30:49| and restaurant with drive-thru.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5449)|
| 1:30:52| Staff recommendation, approve the requested fuel station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5452)|
| 1:30:56| restaurant, and drive-thru facility uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5456)|
| 1:30:58| subject to 14 conditions to ensure the proposed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5458)|
| 1:31:03| is consistent with development standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| for uses permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5467)|
| 1:31:08| Commissioner Hill, I have to go on the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5468)|
| 1:31:09| and recuse myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5469)|
| 1:31:11| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5471)|
| 1:31:12| So we have Commissioner Overton will be recusing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5472)|
| 1:31:17| And we do have some opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5477)|
| 1:31:19| Would you like to proceed or defer, Councilor Mullins?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5479)|
| 1:31:22| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5482)|
| 1:31:24| I'll start off briefly and then reserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5484)|
| 1:31:26| the rest of my time for rebuttal, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5486)|
| 1:31:30| We appreciate staff's work on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5490)|
| 1:31:33| and the 14 conditions that they have recommended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5493)|
| 1:31:36| for approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5496)|
| 1:31:37| We agree with staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| with the exception of there's four conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5499)|
| 1:31:41| we do think that need to be modified slightly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5501)|
| 1:31:44| And I have in the correspondence I sent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5504)|
| 1:31:47| I noted exactly what those conditions need to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5507)|
| 1:31:50| Condition number four, we are asking for seven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5510)|
| 1:31:54| pump stations, not the four that staff recommended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5514)|
| 1:31:56| There's no regulation that adjusts the number| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5516)|
| 1:31:59| of pump stations in the see-in zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5519)|
| 1:32:03| On the exit on the second drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5523)|
| 1:32:05| we've suggested signage to prevent people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| from going left, but we do not want the island.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5529)|
| 1:32:12| We'd rather have striping on there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5532)|
| 1:32:14| because it could interfere with turning movements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5534)|
| 1:32:16| of vehicles from second drive onto the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5536)|
| 1:32:20| On condition nine, we have submitted a site plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5540)|
| 1:32:24| a photometric site plan, and we ask that that be followed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5544)|
| 1:32:27| and that the poles not be limited to 15 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| And the condition number 10 was the operational hours| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5551)|

| 1:32:37| We would like to be able to open it at 5 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5557)|
| 1:32:39| to capture some of that early morning traffic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5559)|
| 1:32:41| coming through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5561)|
| 1:32:42| We think that, I know there's a lot of opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5562)|
| 1:32:44| We did postpone this last week and met with the opposition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5564)|
| 1:32:47| and talked to them about some of their concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5567)|
| 1:32:50| Unfortunately, I don't think we're able to address those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5570)|
| 1:32:52| Councilor Hollins, if you'll,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5572)|
| 1:32:54| let me interrupt you for just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5574)|
| 1:32:55| What was that last condition that you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5575)|
| 1:32:58| Condition number 10, that the drive-through facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5578)|
| 1:33:01| be, they say be closed between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5581)|
| 1:33:04| We'd like to be able to open it up at 5 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5584)|
| 1:33:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5586)|
| 1:33:08| And those are set forth in the letter| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| that I sent out earlier this week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5591)|
| 1:33:14| So with those modifications, we would appreciate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5594)|
| 1:33:16| if you'd follow staff's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5596)|
| 1:33:18| and approve this use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5598)|
| 1:33:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5600)|
| 1:33:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5601)|
| 1:33:22| We have some folks signed up to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| and forgive me if I don't get this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| Mr. Clive Sorrendo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5608)|
| 1:33:33| Okay, we will move on now to Daniel Sanders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5613)|
| 1:33:41| We have three people that wanna speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5621)|
| 1:33:42| and we would like to go in the order of one, two, three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5626)|
| 1:33:47| We can accommodate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5627)|
| 1:33:48| So I guess we've got Jonathan Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5628)|
| 1:33:58| You'll state your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5638)|
| 1:34:00| Hello, John Harris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5640)|
| 1:34:02| 1009 Olive Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| Remind that we have five minutes total here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| so please be mindful of that to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5646)|
| 1:34:10| I am a resident and speak on behalf of the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5650)|
| 1:34:13| of the historic village of Concord,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5653)|
| 1:34:15| a recognized National Register Historic District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5655)|
| 1:34:19| The property for this case is adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5659)|
| 1:34:21| to the National Register District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5661)|
| 1:34:24| The village's historic character comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5664)|
| 1:34:26| from the details found in the placement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5666)|
| 1:34:28| and scale of the buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5668)|
| 1:34:30| the narrow streets, and the mature landscaping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5670)|
| 1:34:33| A portion of the village is zoned commercial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| along Lake Ridge Avenue because it was adjacent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5675)|
| 1:34:38| to a railroad line when the zoning maps were first adopted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5678)|
| 1:34:42| But most of the use in the commercial zone is residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| Many of the contributing buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5686)|
| 1:34:48| dating back to the late 1800s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5688)|
| 1:34:50| the small area between Clay Street and Olive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5690)|
| 1:34:53| are the only commercial uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5693)|
| 1:34:54| a research lab, an art gallery,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5694)|
| 1:34:57| and an air conditioning contractor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5697)|
| 1:34:59| The scale of the buildings defines our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| and that scale is small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| Most homes have a footprint under 2,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| Our larger buildings aren't much bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5708)|
| 1:35:10| The Masonic Lodge, about 2,800 square feet at ground level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5710)|
| 1:35:15| The Presbyterian Church with two buildings combined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5715)|
| 1:35:17| is approximately 4,400 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5717)|
| 1:35:20| The cemetery to the east is actively used| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5720)|
| 1:35:23| and only 60% full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5723)|
| 1:35:25| 92% of the graves are burials within the last 100 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5725)|
| 1:35:30| Families can be seen regularly putting flowers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5730)|
| 1:35:32| on their graves and laying their loved ones to rest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5732)|
| 1:35:37| We met with the applicant to make them aware| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5737)|
| 1:35:39| of our concerns with the oversized scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5739)|
| 1:35:41| and the intensity of the proposed uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| We stated our concerns with issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5744)|
| 1:35:45| of noise, lighting, and traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5745)|
| 1:35:47| We've expressed the use of a drive-through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5747)|
| 1:35:49| is inappropriate when it's so close to a residence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5749)|
| 1:35:54| Their response to our concerns was to submit a plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| to add an additional 700 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5758)|
| 1:35:59| to a facility that is already larger| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5759)|
| 1:36:01| than anything in the adjacent neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5761)|
| 1:36:04| This case has 96 public comments in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5764)|
| 1:36:07| many of them being multiple-page letters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5767)|
| 1:36:09| to the staff and the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| The neighborhood has collected over 1,100 signatures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5772)|
| 1:36:16| on petitions of immediate neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| that don't want this oversized and intense development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5778)|
| 1:36:21| We understand that new development is inevitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5781)|
| 1:36:25| However, new development must be compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5785)|
| 1:36:27| with the character of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5787)|
| 1:36:29| The proposal would be compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5789)|
| 1:36:32| if it was in a development that were located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| at Campbell Station and I-40.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| It is not compatible with our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| or the neighborhood commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5798)|
| 1:36:41| Instead of modeling their establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| to fit within our neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5803)|
| 1:36:44| the applicant insists that our neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5804)|
| 1:36:46| is a great fit for a 7,715 square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5806)|
| 1:36:50| modern restaurant, fueling station,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| hyper-convenience store topped off with a drive-through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5812)|
| 1:36:56| We respectfully disagree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| and we ask this commission to deny the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5819)|
| 1:37:02| If you are with me today and agree, please stand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5822)|
| 1:37:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5829)|
| 1:37:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5830)|
| 1:37:11| Thank you, Planning Commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5831)|
| 1:37:12| Daniel Sanders, 920 Volunteer Landing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5832)|
| 1:37:15| here on behalf of the Concord Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5835)|
| 1:37:18| The zoning ordinance clearly sets a maximum floor area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5838)|
| 1:37:21| of 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5841)|
| 1:37:23| Approving a development or building larger than that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5843)|
| 1:37:26| would be a direct violation of that provision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| The staff mentions providing a firewall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5848)|
| 1:37:30| between the restaurant and the convenience store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5850)|
| 1:37:32| in order to attempt to classify them as a separate building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| according to the building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5854)|
| 1:37:35| However, the CN Zone does not mention the building code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5855)|
| 1:37:38| or reference any definitions from the building code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5858)|
| 1:37:40| It's not clear how the fire separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5860)|
| 1:37:43| satisfies the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5863)|
| 1:37:46| The zoning ordinance defines a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5866)|
| 1:37:47| as any structure with a roof and enclosing walls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5867)|
| 1:37:50| intended to support persons or property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5870)|
| 1:37:54| The zoning ordinance doesn't mention firewalls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| Suggesting that an internal fire separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5876)|
| 1:37:59| changes the definition of building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5879)|
| 1:38:00| under the zoning ordinance is arbitrary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| Firewalls are meant to prevent the spread of fire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5884)|
| 1:38:06| not to circumvent the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5886)|
| 1:38:08| The 5,000 square foot size limit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5888)|
| 1:38:11| is aimed at maximizing the compatibility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5891)|
| 1:38:13| between commercial and adjacent residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5893)|
| 1:38:16| As you've heard, adjacent residential uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5896)|
| 1:38:18| are on a small scale, allowing the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5898)|
| 1:38:22| to exceed this limit by providing internal fire separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5902)|
| 1:38:26| undermines the intent of the ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5906)|
| 1:38:29| And in fact, if you follow this line of thought,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| you have no size limitation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5912)|
| 1:38:35| only a requirement that you add new fire separation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5915)|
| 1:38:39| as the building size increases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5919)|
| 1:38:41| This proposal clearly violates the zoning ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5921)|
| 1:38:43| and we urge you to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5923)|
| 1:38:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5927)|
| 1:38:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5929)|
| 1:38:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5931)|
| 1:38:52| Is it Adrian Rowe, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5934)|

| 1:39:06| It's immediately next door to this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5946)|
| 1:39:09| I am a member of the Chota Masonic Lodge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5949)|
| 1:39:13| We have been residents of this community since 1857.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5953)|
| 1:39:18| Our building has been there since 1870.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5958)|
| 1:39:22| We've been in contact with numerous folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5962)|
| 1:39:24| with regard to this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5964)|
| 1:39:27| One of the gentlemen was a fellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5967)|
| 1:39:29| by the name of Robert McGinnis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5969)|
| 1:39:31| He's a local historian and author.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| Seems to specialize in cemeteries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| He's worked with all the cemeteries in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5975)|
| 1:39:38| He has provided information that indicates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5978)|
| 1:39:41| that there are potential unmarked graves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| within that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5984)|
| 1:39:47| Mr. Yoder, I'll allow you one more minute, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5987)|
| 1:39:49| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| The rest of that discussion was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| that he has been in contact with a fellow| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5994)|
| 1:39:56| by the name of Graham Perry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5996)|
| 1:39:58| He is part of the Tennessee Historic Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=5998)|
| 1:40:00| to make recommendations regarding archeological survey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6000)|
| 1:40:04| That is something we have asked for at length to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6004)|
| 1:40:09| We know that we have unmarked graves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6009)|
| 1:40:12| right along the west edge of our property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6012)|
| 1:40:16| We believe, and we have independent belief,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6016)|
| 1:40:20| that there are also unmarked graves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| within the property that is being discussed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6023)|
| 1:40:26| We respectfully request that this be dealt with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6026)|
| 1:40:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6032)|
| 1:40:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6034)|
| 1:40:42| Thank you, and I do appreciate the comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6042)|
| 1:40:45| from the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6045)|
| 1:40:48| I'll work backwards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6048)|
| 1:40:50| Mr. Yoder, he did show us the map| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6050)|
| 1:40:52| and raised his concerns that there might be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6052)|
| 1:40:55| unmarked graves on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6055)|
| 1:40:56| State law requires that when you're developing property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| if you come across something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6059)|
| 1:41:01| everything stops, and then you have to address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6061)|
| 1:41:04| what you have come, whether it's human remains,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6064)|
| 1:41:07| what is it, and whether that can be moved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6067)|
| 1:41:08| or whether you can continue with the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6068)|
| 1:41:10| That's something that will have to be addressed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| if during our development we go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| that is something that we come across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6074)|
| 1:41:16| Right now, we don't know if there's anything there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6076)|
| 1:41:18| and you can't speculate whether there is or isn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6078)|
| 1:41:21| There might be, and we'll have to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6081)|
| 1:41:25| The building definition doesn't prohibit attached buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6085)|
| 1:41:29| It has long been the interpretation of engineering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6089)|
| 1:41:32| and that in the CN zone, you can't exceed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6092)|
| 1:41:35| that 5,000 square foot with a separate building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6095)|
| 1:41:38| that operates separately, which is what we have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6098)|
| 1:41:40| You not only have a firewall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| but you have separate bathroom facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6102)|
| 1:41:44| so each building, even though they are attached,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6104)|
| 1:41:47| can operate independent from one another.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6107)|
| 1:41:50| And there's been examples of that in the Easy Stop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6110)|
| 1:41:54| that was approved in 2022 on Johnson Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| which has a very similar layout,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6117)|
| 1:41:58| and also the markets at Choteau have several buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6118)|
| 1:42:02| that exceed that 5,000 because they are separated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| by firewalls and different businesses like Dongalo in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6124)|
| 1:42:07| And so that is consistent with the interpretation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6127)|
| 1:42:11| and with the definition of building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6131)|
| 1:42:12| within the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6132)|
| 1:42:16| Now, I understand the neighbors' very sincere concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6136)|
| 1:42:23| They raised many of them in the comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6143)|
| 1:42:26| Too many for me to go through in two minutes and 53 seconds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| I did submit a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6149)|
| 1:42:30| We have a photometric plan addressing the light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6150)|
| 1:42:33| The drive-through automatic voice control speaker systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6153)|
| 1:42:39| that will address the decibels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6159)|
| 1:42:41| That is in line with the proposed ordinance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6161)|
| 1:42:43| that's working its way through Planning Commission right now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6163)|
| 1:42:45| to update the drive-through standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| There's gonna be a 25-foot buffer zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| with vegetation at the rear of the property line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6170)|
| 1:42:54| We're gonna be putting a sound barrier fence there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| Our landscaping will have to be updated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6177)|
| 1:42:59| to see what trees will remain| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| and what trees we'll have to replant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6181)|
| 1:43:03| as we go through the process with our grady.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6183)|
| 1:43:05| But we think we can keep| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6185)|
| 1:43:06| most of the existing vegetation at that location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6186)|
| 1:43:12| Our photometrics meet dark sky standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6192)|
| 1:43:15| and there'll be 0.1 to 0.2 foot candles at the property line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6195)|
| 1:43:19| and once you get to where the cemetery is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6199)|
| 1:43:21| it'll be no light transference whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6201)|
| 1:43:23| And that's what our photometric shows| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6203)|
| 1:43:24| and we haven't seen anything that rebutts that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6204)|
| 1:43:30| I heard follow the rules, follow the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6210)|
| 1:43:32| and that's what we're trying to do here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6212)|
| 1:43:34| We are following the rules that are in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6214)|
| 1:43:36| You have a lot of discretion to exercise your authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6216)|
| 1:43:39| within the rules,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6219)|
| 1:43:40| but they have to be within existing standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6220)|
| 1:43:42| which is the reason why I asked for those conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6222)|
| 1:43:45| to be modified because they are not currently codified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6225)|
| 1:43:48| in a way that they can be enforced in this application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6228)|
| 1:43:52| So we believe it meets the use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6232)|
| 1:43:57| subject to the 14 conditions as we propose to be modified| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| and we'd ask that you approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6240)|
| 1:44:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6242)|
| 1:44:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6243)|
| 1:44:06| Mr. Elliott.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6246)|
| 1:44:08| Mr. Elliott, could you comment on the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6248)|
| 1:44:13| I guess the difference of definition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| of the 5,000 square feet, the firewall separation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6255)|
| 1:44:20| Yes, in the building code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6260)|
| 1:44:23| there is a, it defines a building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6263)|
| 1:44:26| as being two separate buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6266)|
| 1:44:27| as long as there's a firewall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6267)|
| 1:44:28| that separates the two structures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6268)|
| 1:44:32| What they're showing on this plan though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| is just a fire separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6274)|
| 1:44:35| They will have to modify it and show a firewall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6275)|
| 1:44:37| to make it meet the requirement of two separate buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6277)|
| 1:44:42| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6282)|
| 1:44:43| Yeah, it sure does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6283)|
| 1:44:44| Yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| Mr. Reynolds, I know you have quite a bit of background| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6286)|
| 1:44:52| on this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6292)|
| 1:44:54| It's your case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6294)|
| 1:44:55| You wanna share some thoughts about this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6295)|
| 1:45:00| how we got to the pumps, number of pumps?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6300)|
| 1:45:03| Yeah, sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6303)|
| 1:45:06| Well, with getting to the number of pumps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6306)|
| 1:45:10| we have to look at what the use on review process is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6310)|
| 1:45:14| Each site is looked independently| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6314)|
| 1:45:17| so we don't have precedent between approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6317)|
| 1:45:21| And we're looking to make sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6321)|
| 1:45:22| that the proposed use is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| with the development standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6325)|
| 1:45:26| for uses permitted on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6326)|
| 1:45:29| And the planning commission can impose conditions upon that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6329)|
| 1:45:33| And there's some pretty strong wording| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6333)|
| 1:45:36| in the use of permit on review section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6336)|
| 1:45:41| the procedures authorized for use of permit on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6341)|
| 1:45:47| In the approval or denial section,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6347)|
| 1:45:49| it says the planning commission may approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6349)|
| 1:45:53| the development plan or use permit on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6353)|
| 1:45:56| where it can be shown the proposed use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6356)|
| 1:45:58| or the proposed plan or uses in harmony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6358)|
| 1:46:00| with the general purpose and intent of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6360)|
| 1:46:03| Adopt the plans as reasonably necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6363)|
| 1:46:05| for the convenience and welfare of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6365)|
| 1:46:08| Then it goes on to say the planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| may deny the development plan or use on review| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| where the above cannot be shown| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6373)|
| 1:46:16| or where it can be shown that the approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6376)|
| 1:46:18| would have an adverse impact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6378)|
| 1:46:21| on the character of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6381)|
| 1:46:22| in which the site is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6382)|
| 1:46:24| And it says, whereas a use may be appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6384)|
| 1:46:28| in one location and inappropriate in another location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6388)|
| 1:46:33| of the same zone district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6393)|
| 1:46:34| the planning commission shall be guided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6394)|
| 1:46:36| by the policies of the comprehensive plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6396)|
| 1:46:39| and the general and specific standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6399)|
| 1:46:40| in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6400)|
| 1:46:43| So while there might be some elements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6403)|
| 1:46:49| that are not explicitly stated in the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6409)|
| 1:46:52| there's definitely pieces that make something more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6412)|
| 1:46:55| or less compatible with the area in which it is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6415)|
| 1:47:03| I did a little bit of research on gas stations in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6423)|
| 1:47:09| just to get an idea of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6429)|
| 1:47:12| and it's really hard to do apples to apples comparisons| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6432)|
| 1:47:15| across an entire county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6435)|
| 1:47:18| You have different roads that properties are on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6438)|
| 1:47:22| distances between the next similar use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6442)|
| 1:47:25| and those types of things can influence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6445)|
| 1:47:28| how individual gas stations are constructed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| But I was just trying to get an idea,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6451)|
| 1:47:33| okay, well, how many pumps and how big| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6453)|
| 1:47:36| is a different convenience store| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6456)|
| 1:47:38| in a different area of town?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6458)|
| 1:47:42| And I was kind of surprised when I looked at something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6462)|
| 1:47:46| as big as, say, the gas stations at Watt Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6466)|
| 1:47:51| the couple of those travel stations had six pumps for,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6471)|
| 1:47:57| and it's double, so it'd be 12 total points of sale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6477)|
| 1:48:01| for more of like your retail customer drives up the car.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6481)|
| 1:48:07| Obviously, they have a separate business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6487)|
| 1:48:09| outside of the retail customer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6489)|
| 1:48:11| So those are big establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6491)|
| 1:48:13| In general, the retail component is quite larger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6493)|
| 1:48:17| But then looking at areas that had a little more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6497)|
| 1:48:23| neighborhood-centric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6503)|
| 1:48:27| so not too far from the site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6507)|
| 1:48:29| and actually it's not too far from the Chateau area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6509)|
| 1:48:32| On Harvey Road, there's a small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6512)|
| 1:48:35| more neighborhood-oriented gas station.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6515)|
| 1:48:39| It's, if you're familiar with McPhee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6519)|
| 1:48:42| or on the southern end of McPhee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6522)|
| 1:48:44| right before we get to the railroad track,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6524)|
| 1:48:45| you go under there, on the south side of the railroad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6525)|
| 1:48:48| you go under there, on the south side of the railroad,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6528)|
| 1:48:51| is Harvey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6531)|
| 1:48:53| There's a small convenience store gas station| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6533)|
| 1:48:57| built in the planned residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| which the planned residential zone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6540)|
| 1:49:01| does allow commercial uses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6541)|
| 1:49:03| once you get to a certain size, residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6543)|
| 1:49:07| And so that particular one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6547)|
| 1:49:09| was about 3,000 square feet of retail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| and about 3,400 square feet of retail in-house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6553)|
| 1:49:19| Four pumps, so eight stalls total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6559)|
| 1:49:28| The breadbox on Gleason and Gallagher View,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| which again is an independent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6571)|
| 1:49:33| like smaller commercial area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6573)|
| 1:49:36| it by itself has three pumps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6576)|
| 1:49:39| 2,500 square feet of retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6579)|
| 1:49:43| And then on the same road, Gleason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6583)|
| 1:49:46| at Ebenezer, again, it's kind of a standalone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6586)|
| 1:49:50| commercial spot, four pumps,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6590)|
| 1:49:52| and 4,000 square feet of store area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6592)|
| 1:49:55| And once you get to something as big as,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| has seven pumps, you're starting to look at,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| like the Kroger on Kingston Pike in Farragut| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6600)|
| 1:50:03| has seven pumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6603)|
| 1:50:05| You know, Kingston Pike is a much different environment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6605)|
| 1:50:09| and it is attracting a much different type of traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6609)|
| 1:50:14| and much broader reach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6614)|
| 1:50:18| And I don't know, I just couldn't find anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6618)|
| 1:50:22| that was a neighborhood-related scale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6622)|
| 1:50:25| that was of the type of development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6625)|
| 1:50:28| that we're looking at today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6628)|
| 1:50:29| So the reason why staff is recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6629)|
| 1:50:33| reducing the number of pumps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6633)|
| 1:50:34| is to try to get more in conformance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6634)|
| 1:50:36| with what we're seeing for more neighborhood-oriented uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6636)|
| 1:50:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6640)|
| 1:50:42| Thank you, Mr. Reynolds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6642)|
| 1:50:46| Commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6646)|
| 1:50:52| I'll jump out there just to get the conversation started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6652)|
| 1:50:57| Because, man, this is a tough one for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6657)|
| 1:50:59| I mean, it's hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6659)|
| 1:51:02| The property's already zoned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6662)|
| 1:51:05| so there are definite rights with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6665)|
| 1:51:09| It's zoned neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6669)|
| 1:51:11| so there are definite rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6671)|
| 1:51:13| and allowable uses in that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6673)|
| 1:51:18| You know, certainly I'm sure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6678)|
| 1:51:19| like the rest of the commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6679)|
| 1:51:20| we've been getting a lot of calls| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6680)|
| 1:51:21| from residents and elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6681)|
| 1:51:25| even all the way up to state elected officials,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6685)|
| 1:51:27| you know, I mean, calling with concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6687)|
| 1:51:30| With it, I'm just, I'm struggling with it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6690)|
| 1:51:33| because I understand exactly where the community is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6693)|
| 1:51:36| You know, Mr. Goeder, I would be very concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6696)|
| 1:51:38| about the grave sites over there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6698)|
| 1:51:43| The size of the buildings, I think, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6703)|
| 1:51:46| we've got a pretty good answer to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6706)|
| 1:51:48| from how codes looks at it and relies on that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6708)|
| 1:51:54| with the firewalls from a definition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6714)|
| 1:51:59| But I don't know, I just wanted to throw out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6719)|
| 1:52:01| this is a tough decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6721)|
| 1:52:02| And so we'll continue the deliberation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6722)|
| 1:52:05| I think Commissioner Barger had some comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| Commissioner Barger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6729)|
| 1:52:11| I just wanna point out that there is a Weigel's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6731)|
| 1:52:14| at Schroeder Road that has 16 pumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6734)|
| 1:52:18| And it's so, I believe neighborhood commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6738)|
| 1:52:22| Somebody correct me if I'm wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6742)|
| 1:52:23| I was looking it up in the middle of Commissioner Huber| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6743)|
| 1:52:27| talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6747)|
| 1:52:28| I know that we brought this up on Tuesday as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6748)|
| 1:52:32| about it going down to four pumps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6752)|
| 1:52:35| for a total of eight sales positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6755)|
| 1:52:38| And I just don't know that with there not being a mandate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6758)|
| 1:52:45| from planning or this body, that that's really up to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6765)|
| 1:52:49| I totally understand the neighborhoods issues with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6769)|
| 1:52:54| I lived in a house that was built in 1899| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6774)|
| 1:52:56| for a very long time, very, very well-versed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6776)|
| 1:53:00| in the Concord area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6780)|
| 1:53:01| My mom grew up in a historic house there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6781)|
| 1:53:04| It still stands today that was built in the 1700s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6784)|
| 1:53:06| So I get that part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6786)|
| 1:53:08| I do wanna bring up too though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6788)|
| 1:53:10| that they just spent millions of dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6790)|
| 1:53:13| making Concord a four lane road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6793)|
| 1:53:16| So I do think that that area can handle this type of building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6796)|
| 1:53:26| and that the original amount of pumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6806)|
| 1:53:30| One second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6810)|
| 1:53:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6811)|
| 1:53:31| Commissioner Higgins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6811)|
| 1:53:34| I have a couple of thoughts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6814)|
| 1:53:37| and probably have to come back,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6817)|
| 1:53:40| but I wanna start with the firewall separation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6820)|
| 1:53:45| I completely agree that from a building code standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6825)|
| 1:53:51| and by extension zoning standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6831)|
| 1:53:53| it makes sense that by putting a firewall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6833)|
| 1:53:56| we are creating two separate businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6836)|
| 1:54:01| or sorry, two separate buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6841)|
| 1:54:04| The thing that was interesting to me is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6844)|
| 1:54:10| there's a little bit of vagueness with this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6850)|
| 1:54:13| where it says no individual building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6853)|
| 1:54:15| or commercial establishment shall have a floor area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| exceeding 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6858)|
| 1:54:21| What I'm curious about is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6861)|
| 1:54:24| have there been other CN instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6864)|
| 1:54:28| where we've had multiple buildings that on the same parcel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6868)|
| 1:54:34| that come up over the 5,000 square feet that you know of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6874)|
| 1:54:45| I think the Choteau market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| there is some that I think originally there wasn't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6888)|
| 1:54:52| most of those structures were not intended| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6892)|
| 1:54:54| to be over 5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6894)|
| 1:54:55| I think they kind of grew over time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6895)|
| 1:54:57| There was I believe one or two that were approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6897)|
| 1:55:02| I don't think they were built though on the backside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6902)|
| 1:55:05| that had like a main level and then like a basement level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6905)|
| 1:55:09| So you didn't really see,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6909)|
| 1:55:10| it was kind of a different situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6910)|
| 1:55:12| but grand total was a larger building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6912)|
| 1:55:17| and then there was a newer one recently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6917)|
| 1:55:21| but I would say that it's not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6921)|
| 1:55:23| I think how we're looking at these going forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6923)|
| 1:55:27| are different than past interpretations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6927)|
| 1:55:32| Steve, do you have a different thought on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6932)|
| 1:55:35| or want to add anything to what I've said?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6935)|
| 1:55:36| But like we've seen that the intent here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6936)|
| 1:55:42| is to have smaller, more neighborhood scale structures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6942)|
| 1:55:45| and allowing things to continue to add on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6945)|
| 1:55:49| to each other, gets things out of scale,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6949)|
| 1:55:53| becomes more of like a shopping center type situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6953)|
| 1:55:56| and not neighborhood scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6956)|
| 1:55:58| Yeah, that's part of what I'm getting at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6958)|
| 1:56:02| is what's the intent of this line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6962)|
| 1:56:06| And it does seem like the intent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6966)|
| 1:56:10| is to have smaller establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| And so it makes me wonder if you did a 20,000 square foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6973)|
| 1:56:20| shopping center, but divided that up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6980)|
| 1:56:22| into 5,000 square foot tenant spaces with firewalls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6982)|
| 1:56:28| are we looking at that and seeing and saying that's great| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6988)|
| 1:56:33| or thoughts on that, I guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6993)|
| 1:56:39| I don't think in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=6999)|
| 1:56:40| we're gonna be recommending the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7000)|
| 1:56:44| You wouldn't be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7004)|
| 1:56:45| I don't think we would be recommending| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7005)|
| 1:56:47| the same thing in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7007)|
| 1:56:50| In a situation like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7010)|
| 1:56:51| you wouldn't recommend the firewall?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7011)|
| 1:56:54| No building larger than 5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7014)|
| 1:56:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7016)|
| 1:56:57| Mr. Elliott, you were nodding two different directions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7017)|
| 1:56:59| so I'm gonna pick the one that said yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7019)|
| 1:57:02| Would you like to comment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7022)|
| 1:57:03| Well, just to answer yes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| I think some of those structures at the markets at Choteau| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7025)|
| 1:57:08| exceed 5,000 square feet and they have fire separations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7028)|
| 1:57:12| in them for two tenants in each building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7032)|
| 1:57:14| So each commercial establishment is under 5,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7034)|
| 1:57:20| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7040)|
| 1:57:21| I don't think that there's a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7041)|
| 1:57:25| I think if I were representing a client| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7045)|
| 1:57:28| and knowing the building code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7048)|
| 1:57:30| and that the state code references that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7050)|
| 1:57:34| I would push to get this, if that was the intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7054)|
| 1:57:39| I don't see a legal way to oppose the firewall argument.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7059)|
| 1:57:45| However, outside of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7065)|
| 1:57:48| I do think that it seems like the intent of CN| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7068)|
| 1:57:52| is to ensure that we're looking at smaller scale buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7072)|
| 1:57:58| And I think it's okay if they're connected even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7078)|
| 1:58:01| and you have multiple buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7081)|
| 1:58:02| but I think if something that probably isn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7082)|
| 1:58:06| within our scope or purview here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7086)|
| 1:58:10| is gonna be the design of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| And so, it is different like the shopping center situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7092)|
| 1:58:19| That would be very different if it's one large building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7099)|
| 1:58:22| that behind the facade is divided up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7102)|
| 1:58:26| versus if it looks like five individual| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7106)|
| 1:58:29| or four individual buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7109)|
| 1:58:31| So I bring that up to say that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7111)|
| 1:58:35| I know that there's been some discussion about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7115)|
| 1:58:38| I don't see a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7118)|
| 1:58:40| I don't think that it really meets the intent here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7120)|
| 1:58:43| but I don't know that we have the ability to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7123)|
| 1:58:50| oppose that, I don't think that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7130)|
| 1:58:54| based off the legal definitions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7134)|
| 1:58:56| But the other things that I wanted to mention,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7136)|
| 1:59:00| so the comment about the potential unmarked graves,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7140)|
| 1:59:06| is there, there's not a condition in here about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7146)|
| 1:59:11| is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7151)|
| 1:59:12| No, there isn't a condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7152)|
| 1:59:15| There was a concept plan review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7155)|
| 1:59:20| I think it was about 2015, 2016 in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7160)|
| 1:59:23| where we did address something very, very similar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7163)|
| 1:59:27| They actually did, it was a different type of site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7167)|
| 1:59:30| it was already cleared,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7170)|
| 1:59:31| so they didn't have trees to have to deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7171)|
| 1:59:33| And they were able to do some ground penetration radar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7173)|
| 1:59:37| ahead of time and have a study done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7177)|
| 1:59:39| And then on top of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7179)|
| 1:59:43| the radar did not detect anything in that situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7183)|
| 1:59:45| but the archeologist still recommended doing a scrape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7185)|
| 1:59:48| of the soil before mass grading took place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7188)|
| 1:59:53| And the intent there is once you scrape the soil off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7193)|
| 1:59:55| you can see the soil changes on a grave site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7195)|
| 2:00:00| And so I think we could craft a condition| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7200)|
| 2:00:05| regarding scraping in the soil,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7205)|
| 2:00:07| have an archeologist on site and a study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7207)|
| 2:00:11| submitted to staff before mass grading begins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7211)|
| 2:00:15| Yeah, I think that that would be appropriate here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7215)|
| 2:00:18| especially since the applicant is acknowledging the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7218)|
| 2:00:21| that if there are bodies or unmarked graves there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7221)|
| 2:00:25| that there's a process they'll need to go through.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7225)|
| 2:00:27| I think what I would be concerned of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7227)|
| 2:00:29| is if that's a high probability,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7229)|
| 2:00:34| I would want a cautious analysis of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7234)|
| 2:00:39| a proper analysis rather than just mass grading right there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7239)|
| 2:00:43| at least in the zone where that is expected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7243)|
| 2:00:45| to be a high probability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7245)|
| 2:00:47| So I think that would be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7247)|
| 2:00:50| And then I also, I think that to Commissioner Huber's point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7250)|
| 2:00:56| the yes, with it being zoned commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7256)|
| 2:01:00| that comes with certain rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7260)|
| 2:01:02| And what I'll add to that is CN specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7262)|
| 2:01:06| also comes with certain limitations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7266)|
| 2:01:09| And the intent of this is that we try to keep things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7269)|
| 2:01:13| more of a neighborhood scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7273)|
| 2:01:15| So with this being CN,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7275)|
| 2:01:18| I think that trying to keep the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7278)|
| 2:01:23| less like something you would see on Kingston Pike| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7283)|
| 2:01:26| and more like something you would see| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7286)|
| 2:01:27| in a neighborhood corner store type setting is appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7287)|
| 2:01:32| And so with that, the lower number of pumps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7292)|
| 2:01:35| and whether that's four or five,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7295)|
| 2:01:40| maybe there's a middle ground or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7300)|
| 2:01:42| but if we want to treat this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7302)|
| 2:01:47| like it's a more intense commercial zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7307)|
| 2:01:50| then I think it needs to be rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7310)|
| 2:01:52| to a more intense commercial zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7312)|
| 2:01:54| And then we can look at it as if it were a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7314)|
| 2:01:59| one of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| So yeah, I'm not gonna make a motion yet or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7321)|
| 2:02:06| but those are my thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7326)|
| 2:02:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7327)|
| 2:02:08| Commissioner Adams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| That was the segue that I needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7332)|
| 2:02:13| because why did the applicant not go for rezoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7333)|
| 2:02:19| Well, it had zoning in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7339)|
| 2:02:21| and the CN zone had been there since 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7341)|
| 2:02:24| I think in 2004, when they asked for the zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7344)|
| 2:02:28| they asked for CA and that was denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7348)|
| 2:02:30| and they were given CN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7350)|
| 2:02:32| So we're operating within the zone that is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7352)|
| 2:02:35| There's commercial zoning, CA zoning in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7355)|
| 2:02:38| but we were looking at a piece of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7358)|
| 2:02:41| that already had the zone in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7361)|
| 2:02:42| just with the use on review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7362)|
| 2:02:45| Okay, so to me, this is interesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7365)|
| 2:02:48| because the request came through before| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7368)|
| 2:02:54| to be commercial and that was denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7374)|
| 2:02:57| but it was zoned commercial, neighborhood commercial,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7377)|
| 2:03:03| which to Commissioner Higgins' point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7383)|
| 2:03:05| he said it comes with certain limitations,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7385)|
| 2:03:07| but I would say that comes with certain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7387)|
| 2:03:08| not limitations, but parameters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7388)|
| 2:03:10| that are there to really help guide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7390)|
| 2:03:13| what that development should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7393)|
| 2:03:15| And I appreciate the different points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7395)|
| 2:03:19| that folks have made about this example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7399)|
| 2:03:20| and that example using a firewall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7400)|
| 2:03:22| to make a structure larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7402)|
| 2:03:23| but if we made a mistake in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7403)|
| 2:03:25| that doesn't mean we have to keep making the same mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7405)|

| 2:04:47| that doesn't even take into consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| the overall footprint of what this application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7490)|
| 2:04:53| will actually look like to the people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7493)|
| 2:04:55| that live in the community because of all of those pumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7495)|
| 2:04:58| That's not part of the 5,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7498)|
| 2:05:00| That's like other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7500)|
| 2:05:02| That's going to be having all of the car traffic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7502)|
| 2:05:06| the noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7506)|
| 2:05:07| There was a very compelling piece of information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| that came from the public about a fairly like scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7509)|
| 2:05:14| that documented the noise and the pollution,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7514)|
| 2:05:17| both light and from,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7517)|
| 2:05:21| from engines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7521)|
| 2:05:23| I don't think we can get around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7523)|
| 2:05:26| And if the intent of the zone was expressed differently,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| I would feel differently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7531)|
| 2:05:32| But neighborhood commercial is clearly about human scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7532)|
| 2:05:36| And while I appreciate the ways| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7536)|
| 2:05:40| that have been sort of engineered to get around that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7540)|
| 2:05:44| I don't think that's what this zone is about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7544)|
| 2:05:46| So I cannot support this case in good faith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7546)|
| 2:05:51| So I will not be supporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7551)|
| 2:05:55| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7555)|
| 2:05:56| Commissioner Geale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7556)|
| 2:05:59| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| So I,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7560)|
| 2:06:01| I have a couple of questions specifically| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7561)|
| 2:06:03| in relation to what Commissioner Higgins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7563)|
| 2:06:05| and Adams were asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7565)|
| 2:06:06| We've,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7566)|
| 2:06:07| we spent a lot of time talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7567)|
| 2:06:08| how an individual building based on the building code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7568)|
| 2:06:11| we can consider two different buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7571)|
| 2:06:12| but the other half of that statement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7572)|
| 2:06:14| is or commercial establishment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7574)|
| 2:06:15| And I recognize that I'm new here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7575)|
| 2:06:17| So for my own education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7577)|
| 2:06:18| a little discussion on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7578)|
| 2:06:19| how do we define a commercial establishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7579)|
| 2:06:21| Because we have two separate buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7581)|
| 2:06:23| each of them 5,000 square feet in a scenario| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7583)|
| 2:06:25| that Commissioner Higgins brought up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7585)|
| 2:06:26| And these are two entirely different businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| who are operating in that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7588)|
| 2:06:30| I think you could perhaps make the argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7590)|
| 2:06:32| that those are different commercial establishments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7592)|
| 2:06:34| but we're looking at one where we have one applicant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7594)|
| 2:06:37| who is operating a single business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7597)|
| 2:06:39| what we're calling an easy stop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7599)|
| 2:06:41| And they may have two separate uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7601)|
| 2:06:42| but what distinguishes those uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7602)|
| 2:06:44| at least in my mind is a point of sale system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7604)|
| 2:06:46| which is not necessarily an installed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7606)|
| 2:06:48| or intrinsic component of the building that's being built.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7608)|
| 2:06:51| So that's simply a computer system saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7611)|
| 2:06:53| that that's a different place where money is being taken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7613)|
| 2:06:56| Is that what establishes a separate establishment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7616)|
| 2:06:59| Because at least on a plain reading,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7619)|
| 2:07:01| it seems to me that this is a single establishment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7621)|
| 2:07:03| the easy stop owned by this owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| who is going to operate two perhaps different uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| but it's all happening on the same footprint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7628)|
| 2:07:11| So I guess I would like, particularly not just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7631)|
| 2:07:13| for this case, but moving forward to somebody to speak to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7633)|
| 2:07:15| how do we define a commercial establishment in this case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7635)|
| 2:07:19| Mr. Elliott, would you like to speak to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7639)|
| 2:07:21| Well, this is one we've debated multiple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7641)|
| 2:07:28| up in the CODE's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7648)|
| 2:07:29| so I don't have a good answer for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7649)|
| 2:07:33| I think commercial establishment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7653)|
| 2:07:35| defines what the business is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7655)|
| 2:07:37| So in the easy stop that came through in 22,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7657)|
| 2:07:41| at that time we were thinking there would be a McDonald's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7661)|
| 2:07:44| in there and an easy stop,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7664)|
| 2:07:45| clearly two separate commercial establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7665)|
| 2:07:48| In this case, there is two commercial establishments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7668)|
| 2:07:50| There's an easy stop and a Tennessee Callaway's Kitchen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7670)|
| 2:07:55| maybe under the same owner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7675)|
| 2:07:57| but it is clearly two separate businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7677)|
| 2:07:59| The building has separate bathrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7679)|
| 2:08:02| There will be a firewall in there to separate them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7682)|
| 2:08:07| I don't know if that answers your question or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7687)|
| 2:08:09| I mean, yes, that leads me to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7689)|
| 2:08:13| that my interpretation of this is that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7693)|
| 2:08:15| yes, it's two businesses, but they're being separated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7695)|
| 2:08:18| particularly just by a point of sale system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7698)|
| 2:08:20| Ultimately, all that money's going back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7700)|
| 2:08:22| So from the public's perspective,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7702)|
| 2:08:23| this is a single business that they're necessarily going to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7703)|
| 2:08:26| And so to kind of piggyback on what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7706)|
| 2:08:28| Commissioner Adams has pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7708)|
| 2:08:30| we might have done that in the past,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7710)|
| 2:08:32| but as Mr. Reynolds pointed out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7712)|
| 2:08:36| the intent moving forward is to have smaller| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7716)|
| 2:08:38| commercial CN buildings that meet the character.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/planning-r-399-240711?start=7718)|
