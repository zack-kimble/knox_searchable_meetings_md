| 0:00:56| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=56)|
| 0:00:57| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=57)|
| 0:00:58| Here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=58)|
| 0:00:59| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=59)|
| 0:01:00| Let me begin by saying I'm sorry that I wasn't with you last Thursday evening, had a conflict| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=60)|
| 0:01:05| that was unavoidable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=65)|
| 0:01:07| But tonight, I think we have the opportunity to approve a budget which is going to move| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=67)|
| 0:01:12| Knox County forward in a lot of different areas, schools, law enforcement, parks and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=72)|
| 0:01:19| recreation, public health, roads, and neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=79)|
| 0:01:25| Over the course of the past several weeks, you've heard from teachers and principals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=85)|
| 0:01:30| the sheriff, the school superintendent, and our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=90)|
| 0:01:34| They've shared with you their thoughts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=94)|
| 0:01:36| Right now, we have some really good things going on in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=96)|
| 0:01:40| ACT scores above the state and national average.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=100)|
| 0:01:44| BEP reform, which we've worked very hard for, is going to be a reality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=104)|
| 0:01:51| Child growth at unprecedented levels, unemployment rates among the lowest in the country, family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=111)|
| 0:01:58| incomes going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=118)|
| 0:02:00| And this year, our Chambers of Commerce cut the ribbon on at least 150 new businesses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=120)|
| 0:02:04| and I think we all take some pride in that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| And just this past week, it was a real pleasure to cut the ribbon on the South Knoxville Senior| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=127)|
| 0:02:12| Center and also announce a new signature building for downtown Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=132)|
| 0:02:18| It's going in a vacant space, which will make a real difference in the life of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=138)|
| 0:02:22| downtown community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| We've been able to do these things while going eight years without a property tax increase,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=145)|
| 0:02:29| maintaining a very solid bond rating, and a healthy fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=149)|
| 0:02:34| We've also had some challenges and I want to address a few of those tonight as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=154)|
| 0:02:39| Some of the things that have been brought to my attention that deserve my, let me begin| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=159)|
| 0:02:49| with travel and per diem and how we'll do business going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=169)|
| 0:02:55| Going forward, all lodging by any member of my staff will be charged on my cart so that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=175)|
| 0:03:01| I can monitor it closely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=181)|
| 0:03:03| Every member of my staff will claim per diem when traveling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=183)|
| 0:03:08| And anybody in Knox County government who travels more than twice a year will take a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=188)|
| 0:03:13| class in proper travel auditing procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=193)|
| 0:03:19| The purchasing card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=199)|
| 0:03:20| We have gone back and reviewed four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=200)|
| 0:03:24| Over that four years, we've dealt in this government with over $2 billion and less than| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=204)|
| 0:03:31| one-tenth of, one-ten-thousandth percent have we seen anything inappropriate or excessive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=211)|
| 0:03:39| In those areas where we've seen those things, those individuals have been contacted and have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=219)|
| 0:03:45| written checks back to the Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=225)|
| 0:03:49| A couple of other things that I want to report to you that we want to try and do better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=229)|
| 0:03:55| One involves a lot of discussion about miscellaneous items in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=235)|
| 0:04:00| With the miscellaneous items, you have to have those if you're going to run a government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=240)|
| 0:04:05| Some things come up from time to time that you just don't budget for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=245)|
| 0:04:09| But when they do come up and when they are spent, we'll notify you as soon as possible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=249)|
| 0:04:14| about the funds that have been spent and what they've been spent for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=254)|
| 0:04:18| A lot of discussion has occurred about line item transfers across Knox County in every area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=258)|
| 0:04:24| When I was on commission, I had a difficult time understanding those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=264)|
| 0:04:27| And today someone brought to my attention that we need to do a better job of explanations of line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=267)|
| 0:04:33| So in addition to giving you the line items with each and every one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=273)|
| 0:04:37| we'll try and give you also an explanation as to why it occurred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=277)|
| 0:04:41| So that way it will make it easier for you to cast your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=281)|
| 0:04:45| Let me say a word about salaries and salary supplements as it relates to members of my senior staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=285)|
| 0:04:52| And before I do that, I want to say a word about them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=292)|
| 0:04:55| because I think they do a very good job in serving Knox County government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=295)|
| 0:05:00| Mike Arms, the chief of staff, has been the primary architect for the education summit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=300)|
| 0:05:06| which led to the great schools partnership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=306)|
| 0:05:08| He's been our point man on economic development and has done an absolutely outstanding job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=308)|
| 0:05:13| Cynthia Finch supervises hundreds of employees in a wide variety of areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=313)|
| 0:05:20| and manages millions of dollars in budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=320)|
| 0:05:23| And she has been a valuable, valuable asset to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=323)|
| 0:05:27| Dwight Vanderveen, communications and government relations, along with Allison Wagley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=327)|
| 0:05:33| was one of the point persons with John on the BEP reform.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| And a few years ago when we had a position available for homeland security,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=336)|
| 0:05:40| Dwight assumed those responsibilities and we didn't have to fill the position,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=340)|
| 0:05:44| which we could save the money and go back into government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=344)|
| 0:05:48| John Werner. I would not want John as my political speech writer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=348)|
| 0:05:52| But when it comes to managing bonds and portfolios, I don't know that there's anybody better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=352)|
| 0:06:00| John's first month in office resulted in savings to Knox County taxpayers of over $6 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=360)|
| 0:06:07| Through managing of the bonds and our finances over the course of the time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=367)|
| 0:06:10| that this administration has been in place, we saved over $18 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=370)|
| 0:06:14| And, John, I'm very appreciative of that for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| So I wanted to say a few words about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=377)|
| 0:06:21| This morning they approached me about rolling back their salary supplement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=381)|
| 0:06:29| And that's what I'm proposing to you tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=389)|
| 0:06:31| I think they earned this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=391)|
| 0:06:33| I think they're outstanding employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| But it was probably not the right way to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| And as a result, we're rolling that back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=401)|
| 0:06:43| But let me say this, and I want to be very, very clear about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=403)|
| 0:06:47| If you want to blame someone for this, the person you want to blame is standing at this podium right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=407)|
| 0:06:53| That's me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=413)|
| 0:06:55| I take the responsibility for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=415)|
| 0:06:57| I want them to stay throughout this second term, and I'm very proud of the work they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=417)|
| 0:07:04| I will make those adjustments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=424)|
| 0:07:06| Today, or this afternoon, I should say, I met with Chairman Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=426)|
| 0:07:10| And between the two of us, I think we've talked with just about every commissioner over the course of the past several weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=430)|
| 0:07:16| about trying to do some more for those at the lower end of our pay scale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=436)|
| 0:07:21| Originally, I proposed a 2% salary increase and a $500 bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=441)|
| 0:07:29| We had lots of good ideas, but to be truthful, the best one came from Commissioner Huddleston today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=449)|
| 0:07:34| the one that we could afford and made, we think, the most sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=454)|
| 0:07:40| For those who make less than $45,000 a year, we're proposing an additional $500 bonus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=460)|
| 0:07:47| Commissioner Moore and I thought it would be the most appropriate time, would be in August,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=467)|
| 0:07:51| to give that bonus right before children start back to school to help those families with that assistance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=471)|
| 0:07:58| It's something that, by moving a few things around, I think we can afford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=478)|
| 0:08:04| And I think in front of you, you have a very good budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=484)|
| 0:08:07| I think it's a budget that will move Knox County forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=487)|
| 0:08:10| and continue to place our community among the very best places in this country to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=490)|
| 0:08:18| I hope you'll vote for it, and I hope you'll move it forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=498)|
| 0:08:22| Thank you, Mr. Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=502)|
| 0:08:24| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=504)|
| 0:08:30| You know, we talked about this this morning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=510)|
| 0:08:33| You're putting everyone on per diem, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=513)|
| 0:08:35| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| What is going to be the amount of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| It depends from city to city where you travel and our travel regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=517)|
| 0:08:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=520)|
| 0:08:41| What is ours on commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=521)|
| 0:08:43| It depends on where you're at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=523)|
| 0:08:45| That's satisfactory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=525)|
| 0:08:46| Now, on the cars, are they keeping the car on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=526)|
| 0:08:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=528)|
| 0:08:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=529)|
| 0:08:50| And there will be nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=530)|
| 0:08:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=531)|
| 0:08:52| Just as you and I discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=532)|
| 0:08:53| We talked about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=533)|
| 0:08:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=534)|
| 0:08:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=536)|
| 0:08:57| Commissioner Lutho?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=537)|
| 0:08:58| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=538)|
| 0:08:59| If you would read, have read into the record Resolution 801-SS, I guess,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=539)|
| 0:09:06| which is the budget, I'd like to make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=546)|
| 0:09:11| If you have that read into the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=551)|
| 0:09:14| Clerk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=554)|
| 0:09:16| This is a resolution establishing a general county budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=556)|
| 0:09:20| and making appropriations from the several funds for the department's institutions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| offices, and agencies in Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=564)|
| 0:09:26| for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2007 and ending June 30, 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=566)|
| 0:09:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=573)|
| 0:09:35| Everybody should have received on their desk,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| and I don't know if you've had enough time to look at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=578)|
| 0:09:41| but these are proposed budget changes or amendments to the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=581)|
| 0:09:48| So, in essence, what is offered here is what has been passed out, plus everything on that sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| I've had a little chance to review it in just the few minutes that it's been here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=595)|
| 0:09:59| but let me note, and they can add to it or correct it or anything,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=599)|
| 0:10:05| because I've asked for some clarifications of what's on here, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=605)|
| 0:10:09| And I think we need to ask for clarification if we're not clear as to what's being proposed because it's new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=609)|
| 0:10:16| The first thing of clarification that I notice is that from the miscellaneous column that you read in here later,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=616)|
| 0:10:23| for the discretionary funds, the commissioners for the grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=623)|
| 0:10:28| has been moved from the county's general miscellaneous funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| and put into the county commission discretionary funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| So that part has been basically moved there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| It's no different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=637)|
| 0:10:38| It's just now listed in this category rather than in this broad miscellaneous category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=638)|
| 0:10:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=645)|
| 0:10:46| So that's one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=646)|
| 0:10:47| If you turn over to, it's about the fifth or sixth page over where it says other operating transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=647)|
| 0:11:09| Pages aren't numbered, but it's about five or six pages over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=669)|
| 0:11:14| Other operating transfers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=674)|
| 0:11:15| Yeah, that's at the top of the page.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=675)|
| 0:11:18| So you need to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=678)|
| 0:11:26| The first thing that I noted there is there is a proposed reduction of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=686)|
| 0:11:33| these are grants and matches, of a reduction of $500,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=693)|
| 0:11:40| Mr. Warner, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=700)|
| 0:11:42| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=702)|
| 0:11:46| That went to the sheriff, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=706)|
| 0:11:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=710)|
| 0:11:51| Those funds have been moved to the sheriff's column.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=711)|
| 0:11:53| Fine and large.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=713)|
| 0:11:54| Those are for grants that we have applied for, that there's a match to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=714)|
| 0:11:56| I think we discussed some of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=716)|
| 0:11:58| But those are in the sheriff's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=718)|
| 0:11:59| So it's been moved there directly rather than being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=721)|
| 0:12:02| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=722)|
| 0:12:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=723)|
| 0:12:04| In the next column that we had a lot of discussion on, our last meeting labeled miscellaneous,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| which was $1.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=729)|
| 0:12:14| That now has been reduced to $313,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| And I want to try to explain that as much as they explained it to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=740)|
| 0:12:23| is that basically these funds have been moved to other places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=743)|
| 0:12:30| For the most part, they're still in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| but they have moved to other places so that we can see where, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=751)|
| 0:12:35| they're being spent rather than under this miscellaneous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=755)|
| 0:12:41| The second one, well, the first one there is under salaries and then Social Security.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=761)|
| 0:12:48| John, could you explain where those went to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=768)|
| 0:12:53| They just went to various other line items within other budgets to pick up for salaries and for employee benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=773)|
| 0:12:59| So it has been distributed into various places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=779)|
| 0:13:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=780)|
| 0:13:02| The Employment Administration miscellaneous charge is a reduction of $31,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=782)|
| 0:13:08| And that, you explained, was in the Contra.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=788)|
| 0:13:11| Contra accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=791)|
| 0:13:12| Contra accounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=792)|
| 0:13:13| And that's been moved throughout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=793)|
| 0:13:15| Yes, sir, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=795)|
| 0:13:16| The budget, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=796)|
| 0:13:17| The only one that is, I guess you say, is a reduction is contract with other agencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=797)|
| 0:13:24| That has been reduced?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=804)|
| 0:13:26| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=806)|
| 0:13:27| We had proposed $300,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=807)|
| 0:13:29| We reduced it down to $209,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=809)|
| 0:13:31| And I can tell you with actual numbers that we spent two years ago, that number was $206,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=811)|
| 0:13:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=817)|
| 0:13:38| So that is a reduction in the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=818)|
| 0:13:40| The other thing that's labeled as other, when I inquired about that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=820)|
| 0:13:45| the courthouse security now has been moved from miscellaneous over to the sheriff's department that is providing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=825)|
| 0:13:52| So it shows up over there in terms of courthouse security under the sheriff's department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=832)|
| 0:13:58| The, I'll explain, the discretionary one for the commissioners has been moved to that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| Congress-labeled discretionary commissioner account.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| Now, that leaves $313,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=848)|
| 0:14:14| And I inquired about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=854)|
| 0:14:16| Some of that is for the public building administration cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=856)|
| 0:14:21| Yes, sir, that's how they pay for their telecommunications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=861)|
| 0:14:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=863)|
| 0:14:25| We also have a contract in Knox County to look at site of sales tax collection,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=865)|
| 0:14:32| reviewing where the money should properly go, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=872)|
| 0:14:35| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=875)|
| 0:14:36| And we hire someone there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=876)|
| 0:14:37| So a lot of the money is that contract that we hire, and that pays for itself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=877)|
| 0:14:43| In other words, we collect more money with that contract than we lose.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=883)|
| 0:14:47| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=887)|
| 0:14:49| So that leaves basically, when you leave that out, it leaves very little money that's actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=889)|
| 0:14:55| About $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=895)|
| 0:14:56| That is truly now miscellaneous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=896)|
| 0:14:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=898)|
| 0:14:59| So that would be truly miscellaneous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=901)|
| 0:15:02| But before we would ever spend miscellaneous, it would have to be done by line item transfer sometime before this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=902)|
| 0:15:10| Yes, sir, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=910)|
| 0:15:11| So even at $50,000, whenever that is proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=911)|
| 0:15:15| this commission would have to come back at one of our meetings, like we do for line item transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=915)|
| 0:15:19| We'd have to move it off of that line to someplace.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=919)|
| 0:15:22| So we would have control of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=922)|
| 0:15:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=924)|
| 0:15:26| That's what I had gathered from looking through that, and that was the main thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=926)|
| 0:15:37| Now, the last meeting, it was spoken of in terms of the library, that by moving things around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=937)|
| 0:15:44| and this has already been reported to us, that they have found another $150,000 for the library budget that has to do with materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=944)|
| 0:15:55| And that has been reported on before as locating that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=955)|
| 0:15:58| So that is now listed there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=958)|
| 0:16:01| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=961)|
| 0:16:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=962)|
| 0:16:05| Next to the last page of this is sort of a summary of some of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=965)|
| 0:16:16| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=976)|
| 0:16:17| That is kind of a summary page of those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| I would also add, and it's going to be part of the motion which I'm about to make,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=983)|
| 0:16:30| is that different commissioners and so forth have made certain requests that would be under the grants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=990)|
| 0:16:38| And I'm going to list some of those that I have here, and some of you should have some of that sheet that's passed out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=998)|
| 0:16:44| And that would be one of the East Tennessee Community Design Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1004)|
| 0:16:49| That would be a recommended increase from $20,000 to $25,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1009)|
| 0:16:54| The Will Creek Ballpark from zero to $3,400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1014)|
| 0:17:00| The year-round Santa Charity from $4,000 to $10,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1020)|
| 0:17:05| The Knoxville Zoo or Zoological Gardens from I think now the recommendation is $75,000 would go to $100,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1025)|
| 0:17:12| and that's been stuck at that number for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1032)|
| 0:17:15| I would add that I served on that board of directors for several years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1035)|
| 0:17:19| and I think it's a very worthy thing in this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1039)|
| 0:17:22| and we ought to support it probably even more than even this level.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1042)|
| 0:17:28| The film commission that Commissioner Lambert had discussed last time, that was from $90,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1048)|
| 0:17:36| but the commission had given an additional $20,000 during the year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| and he spoke to take that back to that number which would be $110,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1060)|
| 0:17:46| The Farrakut Youth Baseball from $1,500 to $2,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1066)|
| 0:17:50| Also, as already pointed out in the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1070)|
| 0:17:55| that the salary increases as recommended by the mayor of 2% plus $500 bonus,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1075)|
| 0:18:01| which I think was around Christmas time or December,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1081)|
| 0:18:05| and the suggestion that the mayor has just made now that employees making $45,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1085)|
| 0:18:12| would receive an additional $500 bonus in the month of August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1092)|
| 0:18:18| So, Mr. Chairman, my motion is to take everything that has been originally proposed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| all these changes that the mayor now has made, along with this sheet of what I just read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1104)|
| 0:18:30| My motion is that this is what we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1110)|
| 0:18:34| That's my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1114)|
| 0:18:36| All right, we've got a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1116)|
| 0:18:37| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1118)|
| 0:18:40| Commissioner Huddleston, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1120)|
| 0:18:44| Commissioner Trammell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1124)|
| 0:18:45| Yeah, the miscellaneous accounts, those come through us through line item transfers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1125)|
| 0:18:51| Let me ask you this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1131)|
| 0:18:52| Why wouldn't we just do away with the miscellaneous account?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1132)|
| 0:18:56| Well, we would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| Somebody needed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1137)|
| 0:18:58| I mean, they would have to come before us anyway in a line item transfer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| The only thing that's not accounted for, John Warner has just indicated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1141)|
| 0:19:05| the only thing that's left from that $1.1 million, the only thing that is now left that is clearly undesignated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1145)|
| 0:19:15| The rest of it has been moved to those different places, as you've just indicated they should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1155)|
| 0:19:19| That has been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1159)|
| 0:19:20| They have filed the advice of various commissioners and, in fact, have done that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1160)|
| 0:19:24| and have located those throughout the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1164)|
| 0:19:27| The only thing that's not accounted for by a contract through the public building authority,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| which we already have and would have to pay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1171)|
| 0:19:34| and through the contract we have to pay for making sure we collect our proper sales tax, okay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1174)|
| 0:19:42| and we already have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1182)|
| 0:19:43| The only thing left that's truly miscellaneous that's not designated is $50,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1183)|
| 0:19:48| and that would, in fact, have to be approved by this body any time it would be requested to be moved throughout the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1188)|
| 0:19:55| So there's not really much left that has not been accounted for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| It seems it would take a step out of it, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1199)|
| 0:20:01| Instead of doing a line item transfer that would just come to commission, that money would sit in the general fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1201)|
| 0:20:06| and then we just give them the money in the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1206)|
| 0:20:09| Commissioner Drummoll, throughout the year, if we approve zero out of $50,000, it would stay in the fund balance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1209)|
| 0:20:17| It would stay in the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1217)|
| 0:20:18| It would never be appropriated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1218)|
| 0:20:20| It is there, but it would never be spent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1220)|
| 0:20:23| So if it's never spent, it's left.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1223)|
| 0:20:26| Let me see if I can work this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1226)|
| 0:20:27| Mr. Mayor, would it be a problem of what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1227)|
| 0:20:32| It's $313,000 left in there, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1232)|
| 0:20:35| $50,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1235)|
| 0:20:36| Yeah, but minusing the PBA, I mean, that hasn't been minused yet, has it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1236)|
| 0:20:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1240)|
| 0:20:41| It will be going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1241)|
| 0:20:42| So the miscellaneous, would it bother if we just, anything that comes out of there, we run it through the commission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1242)|
| 0:20:49| We're going to, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1249)|
| 0:20:50| I mean, just as a regular agenda item, if you need it, whatever we need it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1250)|
| 0:20:54| I think unless there's a dire emergency and at that time I'll notify you that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1254)|
| 0:20:58| Okay, if we, does that take care of that, Mr. Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1258)|
| 0:21:02| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1262)|
| 0:21:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1263)|
| 0:21:05| Commissioner Cawood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1265)|
| 0:21:07| I've got a question about ending this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1267)|
| 0:21:11| If departments have money left over from this year's budget, do they get to carry that over for next year if they haven't spent it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1271)|
| 0:21:20| It needs to roll forward as a part of our budget or we've got a large problem on our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1280)|
| 0:21:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1294)|
| 0:21:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1297)|
| 0:21:38| I think in years past that has rolled over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| Is that, that's what I understood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| Not unless it was something that was specifically designated perhaps through a grant or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1307)|
| 0:21:52| Flu mist, for example, might have been something that was in that category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| Nothing else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1315)|
| 0:21:56| Capital projects, perhaps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1316)|
| 0:21:58| But other than that, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1318)|
| 0:22:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1322)|
| 0:22:03| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1323)|
| 0:22:04| Yes, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1324)|
| 0:22:05| Is, are there some planning dollars in this budget for a skate park in Powell?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1325)|
| 0:22:11| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1331)|
| 0:22:12| I really appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1332)|
| 0:22:13| And I just want to say that I, with the additions for the film commission and for those planning dollars,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1333)|
| 0:22:19| I intend to vote for this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1339)|
| 0:22:21| And I just want to say to the media out here, you know, what, every community has problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1341)|
| 0:22:27| Every organization has problems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1347)|
| 0:22:29| But what defines it is how they deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1349)|
| 0:22:31| And I think that we have dealt with this budget in a very mature fashion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1351)|
| 0:22:36| And we have passed a great, we're going to pass a great budget with no tax increase for the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1356)|
| 0:22:46| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1366)|
| 0:22:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1367)|
| 0:22:50| The budget's better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1370)|
| 0:22:52| And I appreciate all those who have made it better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1372)|
| 0:22:54| I still think that in our joy about what we've been able to do, let's recognize what we haven't been able to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1374)|
| 0:23:00| And that is that we are gauging a lot of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1380)|
| 0:23:04| And I'm worried about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1384)|
| 0:23:06| And I'm worried that it's going to impinge on us in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1386)|
| 0:23:11| But the budget is better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1391)|
| 0:23:12| I do have one question about some of the changes, and that is under the commission office changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1392)|
| 0:23:19| I see we went from zero to 25,000 for a vehicle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1399)|
| 0:23:24| Are we commissioners getting a vehicle?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1404)|
| 0:23:27| That's your beer inspector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1407)|
| 0:23:28| That's our beer inspector?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| Well, good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1411)|
| 0:23:33| I just wasn't there in the budget in that position before, but that's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1413)|
| 0:23:38| I hope he drives sober.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1418)|
| 0:23:44| You know, looking at this budget, it has strengths and weaknesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1424)|
| 0:23:47| I wish we could do more for schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| I'm glad we're doing more for libraries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1429)|
| 0:23:50| I think we can do even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1430)|
| 0:23:52| At this point, it would be foolish to try to get anything better out of this process or out of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1432)|
| 0:23:57| I'm feeling a bit like a Christian scientist with appendicitis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1437)|
| 0:24:02| It isn't exactly what I want to do, but I know I have to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1442)|
| 0:24:05| So thank you all very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1445)|
| 0:24:08| Commissioner Oppenhorn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1448)|
| 0:24:09| Yeah, I'd just like to thank Commissioner Pinkston and Chairman Moore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1449)|
| 0:24:12| and the mayor for getting together and working this budget out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1452)|
| 0:24:15| I mean, our county needs to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| I do appreciate those people that got together, and I know now the county can move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1456)|
| 0:24:20| and people in Knox County can hopefully sleep better than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1460)|
| 0:24:25| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1465)|
| 0:24:27| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1467)|
| 0:24:29| This is a budget that I'm going to vote for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1469)|
| 0:24:31| And as we're looking over the coming year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1471)|
| 0:24:33| I know that there's been a discussion about looking at next year the possibility of raising taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1473)|
| 0:24:39| And I just want to go on record as saying that I oppose this unless we've done everything we can in this budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1479)|
| 0:24:45| that we should do, we need to do, we can do, we ought to do to become more efficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1485)|
| 0:24:49| and reduce the cost of government.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1489)|
| 0:24:51| So I wanted to throw out a couple of options here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1491)|
| 0:24:53| I feel like it's been a good thing that we have looked at the travel and the meals and the credit cards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1493)|
| 0:25:01| And I would like to see us do this on a regular basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1501)|
| 0:25:04| As a matter of fact, I don't know if this is the appropriate time or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1504)|
| 0:25:06| but I would like to make a motion that we get a monthly report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1506)|
| 0:25:09| or a quarterly report on travel, meals, and credit cards, including the constitutional officers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1509)|
| 0:25:16| I would also suggest that we review the new travel procedure that we just passed last month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1516)|
| 0:25:21| take a look at it, make sure we're all comfortable with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1521)|
| 0:25:24| and particularly look at the section with regards to the executive travel card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| I also feel that we should look at an audit every two years of our constitutional offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1529)|
| 0:25:36| We just got through with an audit that was reported in the media with the court clerk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1536)|
| 0:25:40| I know they get audited every year, but with regards to procedures and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1540)|
| 0:25:43| why didn't the audit pick up some of the things that were in the audit that we just saw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| I think those are things that we've got to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1546)|
| 0:25:49| So, again, I just throw that out for consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1549)|
| 0:25:51| And I guess my last thing is to take a look at an audit committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1551)|
| 0:25:56| that as we look at these and as we look at efficiencies and so forth| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1556)|
| 0:26:00| and as we let our people know that we're doing everything that we possibly can| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| to make their government more efficient, that these will be a step in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1563)|
| 0:26:08| So, Mr. Chairman, I don't know if this is a proper time to make that motion or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1568)|
| 0:26:12| but I would make the motion that we receive these monthly reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| or perhaps the commission would ask for quarterly reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1576)|
| 0:26:19| I think the review of the travel procedure we can do without a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1579)|
| 0:26:22| And the other two things would be up for consideration later on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1582)|
| 0:26:26| I think we've got a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1586)|
| 0:26:28| Can we amend that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1588)|
| 0:26:31| I understand. I might include that. Could you clarify that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1591)|
| 0:26:35| Clarify would be that we receive a monthly report on travel meals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1595)|
| 0:26:38| and credit cards from all departments, including the constitutional offices.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1598)|
| 0:26:43| If the law director will permit that as part of it, I'll include it in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1603)|
| 0:26:49| That's up to you, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1609)|
| 0:26:51| If there's no objection, Mr. Chairman, from any commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1611)|
| 0:26:54| I would include that in the motion that we receive those reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1614)|
| 0:26:59| I was second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1621)|
| 0:27:02| Going to the committee, I think we've had an informal committee with the chairman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1622)|
| 0:27:07| and the chairs of the two committees with the audit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1627)|
| 0:27:12| I had already asked to be added to this month's meeting to let our internal audit, Richard Walls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1632)|
| 0:27:19| review all P cards every month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1639)|
| 0:27:22| So we can go ahead and do that today if that's the part of what you're trying to do today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1642)|
| 0:27:29| I've already had that for this month, but we can go ahead and do it now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1649)|
| 0:27:32| It's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1652)|
| 0:27:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1653)|
| 0:27:34| If the law director says that's proper, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1654)|
| 0:27:38| It's up to you, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1658)|
| 0:27:40| I would put it in the motion if nobody objects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1660)|
| 0:27:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1663)|
| 0:27:44| The second accepts it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1664)|
| 0:27:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1665)|
| 0:27:46| Commissioner Trammell.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1666)|
| 0:27:48| I still have reservations about the budget, $102 million with no revenue stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1668)|
| 0:27:56| And I talked to the mayor today, and I'm trying to feel better about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1676)|
| 0:28:01| I talked to Mr. Werner earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1681)|
| 0:28:03| But $9 million out of your debt service account, $6 million out of your rainy day fund,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1683)|
| 0:28:09| and $87 million in bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1689)|
| 0:28:12| At some point, we have to be realistic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1692)|
| 0:28:15| I mean, this has to be paid back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1695)|
| 0:28:18| And, you know, I hope growth will take care of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1698)|
| 0:28:22| But $102 million is a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1702)|
| 0:28:26| And at some point we're going to tie that albatross around the taxpayer's neck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1706)|
| 0:28:31| And everybody needs to be aware of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1711)|
| 0:28:33| Everybody on this commission has another budget coming up in a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| And when we have storm water coming, folks, we really, really need to be worried about doing what's right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1717)|
| 0:28:49| instead of worried about being getting reelected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1729)|
| 0:28:53| No tax increase sounds great, but we owe it to our citizens to give them the best that we can up here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1733)|
| 0:29:03| And to be honest with them, I think what we're doing passing this budget with this money is we're delaying the inevitable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1743)|
| 0:29:13| There will be a tax increase down the pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1753)|
| 0:29:17| You know, it's got to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1757)|
| 0:29:20| I don't think our growth will take care of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1760)|
| 0:29:23| But it doesn't seem that anybody else may not agree with me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1763)|
| 0:29:28| but I'm really worried about spending $102 million without a revenue stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1768)|
| 0:29:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1775)|
| 0:29:36| Mr. Bass, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1780)|
| 0:29:42| Lee, I think all of us understand what you're saying, that we have big problems for the coming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1782)|
| 0:29:48| We have storm water and we also have overcrowding in the jails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1788)|
| 0:29:52| We're going to have to build a pod and other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1792)|
| 0:29:55| But, Mike, I want to thank you for coming and stepping up to the plate because everywhere I go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1795)|
| 0:30:01| that's all I hear is what's been going on for the past few weeks about the credit card situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1801)|
| 0:30:08| And I want to thank you for stepping up to the plate because the people wanted to hear from you, not ARMS, not Vandervate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1808)|
| 0:30:16| And I think we heard you and I think you'll do what you said you're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1816)|
| 0:30:21| And I had a few things that I was going to say, but you kind of stopped that in its track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1821)|
| 0:30:28| So, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1828)|
| 0:30:32| Commissioner Boas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1832)|
| 0:30:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1833)|
| 0:30:35| You know, there is no perfect budget, but I believe this budget makes a statement in several ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| And one big way is supporting education in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1842)|
| 0:30:47| Education is the backbone of any government in any county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1847)|
| 0:30:51| And I think, although it's not perfect, I think it does show a very strong support throughout this county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1851)|
| 0:30:58| for what education means to the people of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1858)|
| 0:31:01| And I appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| The other thing was the salaries that we had discussed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1864)|
| 0:31:09| And it has been addressed and do want to continue to do more for everyone, particularly the people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1869)|
| 0:31:15| as we had discussed on the lower end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1875)|
| 0:31:17| And I just want to say thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1877)|
| 0:31:21| Commissioner Leuthold.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1881)|
| 0:31:22| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1882)|
| 0:31:25| Speaking of education and the BEP reform, do we have any idea how much more we may be anticipating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1885)|
| 0:31:40| Not a specific number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1900)|
| 0:31:41| We're sort of still in the same place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1901)|
| 0:31:43| I think we could look anywhere between six and $12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| It's going to be a very good year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1906)|
| 0:31:47| I met with the superintendent yesterday morning and the chairman of the Board of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1907)|
| 0:31:51| Obviously, they are eagerly anticipating what the number is going to be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1911)|
| 0:31:57| but they feel pretty good about this budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1917)|
| 0:31:59| It does not fund everything that they want, but it takes care of the big needs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1919)|
| 0:32:03| takes care of their literacy initiative, which was very important to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1923)|
| 0:32:06| And as soon as we find something out, believe me, we'll be e-mailing each and every one of you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1926)|
| 0:32:11| or faxing each and every one of you and letting you know what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1931)|
| 0:32:14| We did hear something that may or may not happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| We heard the governor may be coming here to talk, to sign the legislation on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| I don't know if that's true or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1940)|
| 0:32:21| We'd welcome him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1941)|
| 0:32:22| We'd love to come.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1942)|
| 0:32:23| We've worked real hard on it here, as has our legislative building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1943)|
| 0:32:26| And every penny of that is going to go straight to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1946)|
| 0:32:28| Is that not true?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1948)|
| 0:32:29| It's true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1949)|
| 0:32:30| I think it's, you know, they've taken, they're getting an additional $12 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1950)|
| 0:32:35| At the top, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1955)|
| 0:32:36| And then maybe an additional six or maybe more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| Yeah, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1960)|
| 0:32:42| Over last year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1962)|
| 0:32:45| Commissioner Tramwell, I agree with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1965)|
| 0:32:48| We need to try to tighten our belt as much as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1968)|
| 0:32:53| As Commissioner Hammond has said, we need to try to make sure that we're as efficient as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1973)|
| 0:32:59| that the people of Knox County can trust their government to make sure that we are spending their money wisely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1979)|
| 0:33:06| That's why I was going to have this, the auditor come forward and review these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| I think that's part of the motion now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1993)|
| 0:33:15| And hopefully with everything that we do over the next coming year, we can avoid a tax rate increase next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=1995)|
| 0:33:22| And I think we need to look to the mayor, his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2002)|
| 0:33:27| But the county is also going to be looking to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2007)|
| 0:33:30| And so we need to be ready to step forward as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2010)|
| 0:33:35| I'm ready to vote on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2015)|
| 0:33:37| I'm going to support it as is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2017)|
| 0:33:39| And before I do that, I'm going to read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| Because I am an employee of the Knox County trustee, I may have a conflict of interest in the proposal about to be voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| However, I declare that my argument and my vote answer only to my conscience and to my obligation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2028)|
| 0:33:54| to my constituents and to the citizens this body represents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2034)|
| 0:34:01| Mr. Law Director, do you want to explain?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2041)|
| 0:34:04| As we did in committee, our new county code of ethics policy, adopted February 1,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2044)|
| 0:34:12| requires that any commissioner who has a personal interest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2052)|
| 0:34:17| which means that either they have a spouse or a child that lives in the same household that may be an employee of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2057)|
| 0:34:26| that you disclose prior to the vote and at the same meeting and to be included in the minutes of the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2066)|
| 0:34:31| that you have a personal interest in a matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2071)|
| 0:34:42| The so if anyone has a spouse or family member that is employed by Knox County government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2082)|
| 0:34:51| you should disclose that prior to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2091)|
| 0:34:54| And then you can continue to, and that's on page three of the handout that I've given you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2094)|
| 0:35:03| Then you may continue to vote if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| On page two of the handout that I've given you is the conflict of interest section as outlined in the Knox County Charter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2105)|
| 0:35:17| If you are a commissioner and an employee of Knox County, then you should read the disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2117)|
| 0:35:25| And if you wish to vote, you declare that your argument and your vote answer only to your conscience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2125)|
| 0:35:32| and your obligation to your constituents and to the citizens this body represents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2132)|
| 0:35:36| And then you may vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2136)|
| 0:35:41| So if you're an employee and a commissioner, you should read the bold printed statement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2141)|
| 0:35:48| which comes right out of the Knox County Charter and it comes right out of Tennessee law prior to your vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| The charter says that that has to be read immediately prior to the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2154)|
| 0:36:02| And then if anyone has a family member that lives with them, a child that lives with them, or a spouse,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2162)|
| 0:36:13| then they need to declare, they need to disclose under our ethics policy that they have such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2173)|
| 0:36:20| And then they may proceed to vote as explained in our code of ethics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2180)|
| 0:36:26| Thank you, Mr. Law Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2186)|
| 0:36:27| Mr. Commissioner Bowles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| I'm ready to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2190)|
| 0:36:31| I'm going to read this disclosure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2191)|
| 0:36:32| If we're not, after what he just said, then I'll wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2192)|
| 0:36:37| Commissioner Cate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2197)|
| 0:36:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2198)|
| 0:36:40| I want to thank you for your leadership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2200)|
| 0:36:42| I want to thank Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2202)|
| 0:36:44| And I want to thank Mayor Ragsdale and his staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2204)|
| 0:36:47| There's been a lot of talk, shall we say, in the media this week, some of which is right, some of which very honestly wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2207)|
| 0:36:55| Some things were exaggerated and a little bit out of proportion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2215)|
| 0:36:59| Lord knows this commission has been talked about a lot in the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2219)|
| 0:37:04| And having gone through this first budget this week, I am here to tell the people of Knox County this is a good group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2224)|
| 0:37:12| They work together well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2232)|
| 0:37:14| I think you've seen what appeared all week to be a horrible conflict.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2234)|
| 0:37:19| Everybody came together, and everybody's doing what's best for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| And I think that's important, and I'm proud to be a part of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2243)|
| 0:37:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2246)|
| 0:37:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2249)|
| 0:37:31| Commissioner Pinkston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2251)|
| 0:37:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2255)|
| 0:37:36| I got just a couple of words.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2256)|
| 0:37:37| I want to thank the mayor and his staff for getting a budget together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2257)|
| 0:37:41| I want to especially thank my friend, Mr. Vanderveet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2261)|
| 0:37:48| I think we've all worked hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2268)|
| 0:37:49| But I say this commission, as Commissioner Cate has said, it was been talked about a lot in the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| But I can tell you that you've seen a commission who really cares about the people in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2275)|
| 0:38:00| You have a lot of individuals, commissioners on this board that's never seen a budget before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2280)|
| 0:38:05| And it was a learning process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| And I think it was a learning process for us on commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| and probably a learning process for the administration and other county officials meeting with us individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2291)|
| 0:38:17| And I want to say that I'm proud of this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2297)|
| 0:38:20| and I hope that we continue to do good for the citizens of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2300)|
| 0:38:24| And I thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2304)|
| 0:38:27| So, if we're ready to vote, if we want to start with Commissioner Bolus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2307)|
| 0:38:31| We need to read these, don't we, Scott?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2311)|
| 0:38:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2313)|
| 0:38:34| That's why we're going to start with Mr. Bolus, Commissioner Bolus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2314)|
| 0:38:37| Because I'm an employee of the Knox County Schools, I have a conflict of interest in the proposal about to be voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| However, I declare that my argument and my vote answer only to my conscience and to my obligation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2323)|
| 0:38:50| to my constituents and to the citizens this body represents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2330)|

| 0:38:58| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2338)|
| 0:39:00| Because I am an employee of Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2340)|
| 0:39:03| and my wife is an employee of Knox County Schools and has been for 30 years and 25 years, respectively,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2343)|
| 0:39:10| I have a conflict of interest in the proposal about to be voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2350)|
| 0:39:17| However, I declare my argument and my vote answer only to my conscience and to my obligation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2357)|
| 0:39:22| to my constituents and to the citizens this body represents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2362)|
| 0:39:31| Commissioner Trammell, I guess you're next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2371)|
| 0:39:32| I'm on deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2372)|
| 0:39:34| Because I'm an employee of the Knox County Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2374)|
| 0:39:36| I have a conflict of interest in the proposal about to be voted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2376)|
| 0:39:39| However, I declare that my argument and my vote answer only to my conscience and to my obligation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2379)|
| 0:39:43| to my constituents and to the citizens this body represents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2383)|
| 0:39:49| And my wife works for the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2389)|
| 0:39:56| Is that enough for me, Mr. Owens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2396)|
| 0:39:58| All I have to do is say she works for the Sheriff's Office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2398)|
| 0:40:01| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2401)|
| 0:40:02| If you are an employee and a commissioner, then prior to the vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| you would need to read the disclosure statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2406)|
| 0:40:10| If you have a family member, however, that is an employee of the county that lives with you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2410)|
| 0:40:17| or is your spouse, then you would just need to disclose that interest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2417)|
| 0:40:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2423)|
| 0:40:24| Commissioner Caywood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2424)|
| 0:40:27| Because I am an employee of the Juvenile Court Clerk's Office| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2427)|
| 0:40:30| and my husband is an employee of the Sheriff's Office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2430)|

| 0:40:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2454)|
| 0:40:55| I think that concludes all of the declarations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Now, let me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2456)|

| 0:40:59| He no longer lives with me, but I want to declare that he does work for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2459)|
| 0:41:03| And my wife worked for the State Attorney General's Office and has for three or four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2463)|
| 0:41:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2470)|
| 0:41:11| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2471)|
| 0:41:12| Mr. Chairman, could not Mr. Owens, whenever we're ready to take these votes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2472)|
| 0:41:17| read that statement and say those that these people apply to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2477)|
| 0:41:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2481)|
| 0:41:22| The individual has to read it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2482)|
| 0:41:23| Could they read it all at the same time so that we can save some time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2483)|
| 0:41:28| We can sing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2488)|
| 0:41:29| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2489)|

| 0:42:29| We had 18 ayes and one no, so it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| Clerk, we're on item number three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| This is a resolution establishing the Knox County tax rates for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| and ending June 30, 2008, resolution 802.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2560)|
| 0:42:46| Okay, Commissioner Luto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2566)|
| 0:42:48| Mr. Chairman, I'm going to make a motion and I'm going to amend the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2568)|
| 0:42:55| It doesn't change the bottom line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2575)|
| 0:42:57| It will still be at $2.69.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2577)|
| 0:43:00| I talked to the mayor and to Mr. Warner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| and they've agreed that we're going to move $0.11 out of the general fund| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2583)|
| 0:43:08| and move it to the general debt fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2588)|
| 0:43:12| So instead of $1.24 for the general fund, it will be $1.13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2592)|
| 0:43:17| And the general debt fund, instead of being $0.22, it will be $0.33.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2597)|
| 0:43:24| And then, of course, the school operating fund will remain at $1.23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2604)|
| 0:43:30| I'll make that in the form of a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2610)|
| 0:43:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=2612)|

| 0:50:24| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3024)|
| 0:50:25| This is where I needed to the questions I had today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3025)|
| 0:50:30| Mr. Werner, $30 million on resolution number six, 15 million to Powell Middle School.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3030)|
| 0:50:39| And Mike Arms had sent something out late last week showing where this other money went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3039)|
| 0:50:45| The mayor and I talked about it today and you called me this afternoon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3045)|
| 0:50:50| and were telling me that there were two line items in the PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3050)|
| 0:51:00| Can you explain those, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3060)|
| 0:51:02| The energy savings that you're talking about, those are capital projects for that are going to create energy savings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3062)|
| 0:51:11| and these have to be paid for by bond money?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3073)|
| 0:51:15| And none of this stuff is recurring expenses that were?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| And do you have a breakdown of what we're being, what we're spending $15 million on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3081)|
| 0:51:28| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3088)|
| 0:51:29| Could I have it, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3089)|
| 0:51:31| It's in the capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3091)|
| 0:51:32| It's in your capital plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3092)|
| 0:51:33| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3093)|
| 0:51:47| What page is it on, John?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3107)|
| 0:51:49| Pages seven and eight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3109)|
| 0:51:53| Seven is New Harvest Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3113)|
| 0:51:57| On the capital plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3117)|
| 0:52:00| Capital improvement projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3120)|
| 0:52:07| In our book, look at the section that says public building authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3127)|
| 0:52:11| The first one should be city county building, $963,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3131)|
| 0:52:16| $963,000, what is that for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3136)|
| 0:52:19| I do not have the details, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3139)|
| 0:52:22| I'm sorry, I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3142)|
| 0:52:24| I do have a detail from the public building authority book in my office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3144)|
| 0:52:27| I'd be glad to share it with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3147)|
| 0:52:28| Or we could have a meeting with Dale Smith who could go over the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3148)|
| 0:52:34| I don't see Dale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3154)|
| 0:52:42| That's for the city county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| It could be anything from carpet to paint to maintenance of the systems that make heat| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3167)|
| 0:52:52| and cool the building, parking garage adjacent to the building, anything like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3172)|
| 0:52:59| It could be any building that the PBA is, has authority over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3179)|
| 0:53:05| This one says city county building, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3185)|
| 0:53:06| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3186)|
| 0:53:07| The city county building, would that not come, I mean, this is my first budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3187)|
| 0:53:12| and I appreciate you bearing with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| But that seems like it would be maintenance expenses that should be budgeted every year to a little of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3194)|
| 0:53:22| Then why are we borrowing money to pay for them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3202)|
| 0:53:26| There's general maintenance that you do every year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3206)|
| 0:53:28| and there's capital maintenance that you do every so often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3208)|
| 0:53:32| Every now and then we'll have to replace an air conditioning system or the carpet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3212)|
| 0:53:36| And this is a huge building that houses a lot of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3216)|
| 0:53:38| And you're right, it seems like a lot of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3218)|
| 0:53:41| But that's a pretty typical expense of what we have to spend to keep this thing up and moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3221)|
| 0:53:45| And the rent that we pay on this building, though, that each office holder is assessed through the years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3225)|
| 0:53:51| that just pays, I mean, the building is paid for, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3231)|
| 0:53:55| Yeah, that pays for the operations of having it done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3235)|
| 0:53:59| That's an operating income stream.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3239)|
| 0:54:01| Not a capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3241)|
| 0:54:02| Not a capital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3242)|
| 0:54:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| Thanks, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| Okay, any more discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3247)|

| 0:54:54| to, as I said earlier, this is a lot of our Commissioner's first budget and I would like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3294)|
| 0:55:01| to make a motion that we reconsider item number two. We had a Commissioner who voted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3301)|
| 0:55:10| one way, he wanted to vote another. So we've got a second. Is there any discussion? Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3310)|
| 0:55:16| Chairman? What item are we talking about? The budget item. Number two. I think if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3316)|
| 0:55:23| give unanimous consent, we can allow it to under our charter. Mr. Law Director, is that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3323)|
| 0:55:27| correct that is that our charter says something about doing that? Well, no. If we're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3327)|
| 0:55:37| to follow Robert's rules, the member of the prevailing side would need to move to reconsider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3337)|
| 0:55:43| while at this meeting. It would need to be seconded and voted on. If it's reconsidered,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3343)|
| 0:55:50| then you can re-vote. Is this on the budget? Yes. I think you have a member that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3350)|
| 0:55:59| like to cast a yes vote, from what I understand, which would make the budget a unanimous. Does| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3359)|
| 0:56:07| everybody have to then read those things again? Yes, sir. I'm not reading those, but I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3367)|
| 0:56:17| Are they going to have to do it on this motion to reconsider? And then for approval too?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| Yes. You would need to do it here and again. If we just start and just get it done pretty| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3382)|
| 0:56:31| quickly. I would move that we do that to allow this member to do that. That would be my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3391)|
| 0:56:38| We already have a motion. I'll second it then. So we need to start reading so we can vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3398)|
| 0:56:43| So we'll start with Commissioner Bolus. How about if we read them twice when it comes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3403)|
| 0:56:47| our turn? Does that count? Go ahead, Commissioner Bolus. Because I am an employee of the Knox| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom070614special?start=3407)|
