| 0:06:06| Monday, next Monday, so we are now into our public forum. We have two that have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=366)|

| 0:06:33| residence for the record, and you have five minutes. Yes, I'm Bart Owen and I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=393)|
| 0:06:37| live in Knox County, and I'm speaking tonight on Resolution R-22-11-403, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=397)|
| 0:06:43| is the, is that better, which is the construction of a flood wall at the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=403)|
| 0:06:51| Pettigo Sinkhole, and we, I have given you some information there that I left on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=411)|
| 0:06:57| your podiums. The first one is a proposal from GeoSyntec. That is the proposal for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=417)|
| 0:07:03| the flood wall, and what we've done is, I'm representing a group of 11 out of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=423)|
| 0:07:08| the 14 homeowners that are in, that are connected to the sinkhole, and what we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=428)|
| 0:07:16| did is we went through this proposal, and we highlighted and placed questions on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=436)|
| 0:07:20| the things that we have questions about, and that's just for you to review later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=440)|
| 0:07:24| The other document that you have, this is why we are opposed to the wall. This is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=444)|
| 0:07:32| list of the people that have, we've gotten together in a meeting and decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=452)|
| 0:07:36| yes or no, we did want to do this or we didn't want to do this, and we've, these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| are the people that were represented at the meeting or that were represented by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=460)|
| 0:07:44| proxy at the meeting. We oppose the flood wall for five reasons. Number one, and if| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=464)|
| 0:07:51| you'll look at figure one, the flood wall doesn't take care of the source of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| the problem. The source of the problem there is water that is being diverted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=477)|
| 0:08:01| from the opposite side of Pedigo Road onto the basin, and there's also water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=481)|
| 0:08:08| coming from Mendenhall Estates and from another subdivision, Quail Run, which is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=488)|
| 0:08:13| filling the basin. And number two, if you'll look at the figure number two, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=493)|
| 0:08:24| flood wall will reduce the size of the basin. The basin right now is 4.13 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=504)|
| 0:08:31| and the flood wall will reduce that by about 9.94 acres. So what we're saying is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=511)|
| 0:08:40| is that when you push that water off of the basin, you're going to raise the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=520)|
| 0:08:44| water to on the rest of the properties. So we're concerned that that's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=524)|
| 0:08:49| happen. And also, too, that there are some properties that are to the southeast of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=529)|
| 0:08:54| the basin that will be flooded if that water overcomes the rim of the basin,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=534)|
| 0:08:59| okay? Then on figure three, we're concerned with where the water is going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=539)|
| 0:09:08| to go. In the proposal, the proposal states that there'll be some pumps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=548)|
| 0:09:13| built behind the flood wall, and it doesn't say where the water is going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=553)|
| 0:09:19| be pumped to, but if the water, if you push the water back, raise the water in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=559)|
| 0:09:22| the basin, and then pump the water from behind the wall into the basin, then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=562)|
| 0:09:27| you're going to raise the basin even further, so further affecting the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=567)|
| 0:09:31| properties on the site. So we're concerned with that, and we're also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=571)|
| 0:09:36| concerned, too, of a pooling effect that's going to happen behind the flood wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=576)|
| 0:09:41| if the water overcomes the flood wall. If we raise the water in the basin and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=581)|
| 0:09:46| we overcome the flood wall, then you're actually going to cause a flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=586)|
| 0:09:50| behind the flood wall and flood the homes that are in the protected side of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=590)|
| 0:09:55| the flood wall even worse than it was previously. So it's like a swimming pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=595)|
| 0:10:00| effect. We're building a swimming pool in the backyards of the people that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=600)|
| 0:10:04| affected. And then figure number four, it's just the basics, the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=604)|
| 0:10:11| aesthetics of a flood wall and the devaluing of our property, having the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=611)|
| 0:10:19| flood wall there. Obviously, it's harder to sell a home that's got a flood wall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=619)|
| 0:10:22| behind it. It's harder to, you can't develop your property because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=622)|
| 0:10:28| flood wall because, you know, it's going to pool behind it, so you can't put| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=628)|
| 0:10:32| anything on it like a shed or a building of any kind because it's going to pool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=632)|
| 0:10:36| back there. So we're opposed to it for those reasons. Now, the next pictures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| that you'll see, these are the pictures of the actual flooding that went on. And| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=641)|
| 0:10:46| you can see that this water level is at the 1,080 mark. That is where they're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=646)|
| 0:10:52| proposing to put the wall is at the 1,080 mark. If you raise that 1,080 mark| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=652)|
| 0:10:58| above that, you're going to be into the backyards of several other homes. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=658)|
| 0:11:02| you're actually going to be flooding other homes that you weren't flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=662)|
| 0:11:05| previously to the flood wall being built, okay? Lastly, I've been asked by| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=665)|
| 0:11:11| everybody, what is their solution? Obviously, I'm not an engineer and none| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=671)|
| 0:11:14| of us are, but I believe that the solution to the problem is to stop the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=674)|
| 0:11:18| water at the source. Instead of putting a band-aid on it and trying to fix it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=678)|
| 0:11:22| once the water gets into the basin, fix the water before it comes into the basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=682)|
| 0:11:27| Thank you all very much. I appreciate it. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=687)|
| 0:11:33| Mr. Petrus, if you would please approach the podium. State your name and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=693)|
| 0:11:38| county of residence for the record, and you will have five minutes. Yes, my name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=698)|
| 0:11:42| is James Petrus, Knox County. I'm the president of the HOA at Shiloh Gardens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=702)|
| 0:11:50| which is on Cherish Grace Way. One of the residents has been affected by the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| water flooding, and a couple of has been threatened by it. We took it upon| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=717)|
| 0:12:03| ourselves to pump water ourselves and try to make do with what situation we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=723)|
| 0:12:10| were in. The two things that I want to point out is, first of all, they're going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=730)|
| 0:12:14| to build a concrete wall. Aesthetically, it's going to be horrible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=734)|
| 0:12:20| There's only five in our HOA, five homes, but we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=740)|
| 0:12:29| want it. None of the five of us want that wall done. The other thing is that we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=749)|
| 0:12:33| would, according to the proposal, we would be responsible for running the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=753)|
| 0:12:37| electricity to the pumps. Once they put the pumps in, we've got to maintain the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=757)|
| 0:12:41| pumps. We've got to go turn the valves, and that's my understanding anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=761)|

| 0:26:40| answer some of the questions that were presented during public forum?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1600)|
| 0:26:45| Sure. Be glad to, Commissioner Schoonmaker. Yeah, this is a very complex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1605)|
| 0:26:50| matter. I appreciate the opportunity to talk about it. I appreciate these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1610)|
| 0:26:52| folks coming and speaking. I wish we had a solution that was universally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1612)|
| 0:26:58| liked by everyone, but in this case, we don't. We do have a solution that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1618)|
| 0:27:03| this contract with GeoCentic would design that would include the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1623)|
| 0:27:06| construction of two flood walls, one fairly large and one relatively small,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1626)|
| 0:27:11| that would prevent four homes from flooding ever again. There's, in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1631)|
| 0:27:17| 2019, February 2019, four homes received water in their structures. In| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1637)|
| 0:27:24| 2020, one of those homes got water, and these folks may, I think that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1644)|
| 0:27:27| correct, but they can correct me if I've misspoke there. We went through| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1647)|
| 0:27:32| a series. We had a public hearing. We got a GeoCentic, a professional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1652)|
| 0:27:37| civil engineering firm, to come in and look. We looked at 27 different| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1657)|
| 0:27:41| alternatives, and it's just a... It's a drainage area of about 42 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| Includes about 20 acres on the east side of Pettigo Road and 20 acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1668)|
| 0:27:53| on their side of Pettigo Road. Our first proposal was to acquire a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1673)|
| 0:27:59| piece of property behind... Essentially expand the sinkhole for flood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1679)|
| 0:28:06| retention, and the property owner that has that, that we would have to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1686)|
| 0:28:11| acquire, was very much against that proposal, and we didn't think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1691)|
| 0:28:15| they would be appetite for condemnation in that sense. So we went back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1695)|
| 0:28:19| and started... And one of the challenges there is the people that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1699)|
| 0:28:25| having the problem aren't necessarily the ones that would have to contribute| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1705)|
| 0:28:30| to the solution, if that makes sense. So the people that we would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1710)|
| 0:28:33| to acquire the property for the sinkhole, they don't have a flooding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1713)|
| 0:28:37| problem. So there's some issues there that we've really tried to work on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1717)|
| 0:28:42| and like I said, I understand these folks' concern. Flood walls are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1722)|
| 0:28:46| very aesthetic. I 100% agree with that. But I do think if we do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1726)|
| 0:28:51| pursue it, they won't flood again. Yeah, there'll be some minor inconvenience,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1731)|
| 0:28:59| but their structure won't receive water in the future. And I wish I had| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1739)|
| 0:29:02| a better solution to present to this body, but unfortunately, after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1742)|
| 0:29:08| multiple civil engineers looking at it over the last couple of years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1748)|
| 0:29:12| and going through 27 different alternatives, this is really the only option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1752)|
| 0:29:16| that we think is viable and cost effective at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1756)|
| 0:29:21| I'm looking at one of the drawings in the... I guess it's page 15| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1761)|
| 0:29:25| of the documents that were presented. Where is actually the water coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| from? I can give you a map here. I can pass it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1770)|
| 0:29:38| I apologize, I only have one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1778)|
| 0:29:41| The blue... This is an aerial map that has the... KGIS will let| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1781)|
| 0:29:49| you define a drainage point, and then it will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1789)|
| 0:29:52| delineate the upstream area. So everything within this blue area drains to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1792)|
| 0:29:58| that point, so you can see what's included. Everything within this blue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1798)|
| 0:30:03| area comes to this one location. So is it coming| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1803)|
| 0:30:08| from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1808)|
| 0:30:10| northeast to southwest? That's pretty close, yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1810)|
| 0:30:19| You can see, I think it's...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1819)|
| 0:30:22| There's a Baptist church over there, Sharon Baptist, Commissioner Lee might| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1822)|
| 0:30:26| be familiar with it. That's correct. It essentially runs diagonally from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1826)|
| 0:30:30| Sharon Baptist down to the Elm at about a 45 degree angle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1830)|
| 0:30:34| And it's approximately 42 acres in size. So pretty decent, pretty decent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1834)|
| 0:30:40| size drainage way. And then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1840)|
| 0:30:44| who is responsible for the pumps and the electricity and the maintenance on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1844)|
| 0:30:48| the pumps? The way that the agreement's worded is we would... As part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1848)|
| 0:30:52| of the project, we would acquire all that material, and then it would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1852)|
| 0:30:56| be the landowner's responsibility to maintain in perpetuity moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1856)|
| 0:31:06| Okay, let's see here. Okay, thank you, sir. You're welcome. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1866)|
| 0:31:14| Commissioner Schoonmaker. Commissioner Jay, you are recognized. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1874)|
| 0:31:17| Madam Chair. I wanna go... I wanna just go through the questions that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1877)|
| 0:31:23| they had, and then I'm gonna go back to that public meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1883)|
| 0:31:30| Where would this pump water to? The| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1890)|
| 0:31:35| document provided to us said, basically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1895)|
| 0:31:39| deal with it on the upside, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| you're saying this is a watershed, it's coming here, there's no way to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1903)|
| 0:31:46| convert it upstream, so to speak, or upwash, right? Correct. And we haven't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1906)|
| 0:31:52| done really, really detailed analysis yet, that's part of the scope of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1912)|
| 0:31:56| work. We don't believe that the water behind the wall...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1916)|
| 0:32:02| We're trying to protect people from the water in front of the wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1922)|
| 0:32:04| or to the east, you might say. The water, the drainage area behind the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| wall would be nuisance water. It wouldn't necessarily flood their structure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1928)|
| 0:32:13| but it would be enough that they would ultimately wanna get out from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| the wall proper. So where would it go? Where would it send the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| water? Over the wall, into the basin. I see, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1940)|
| 0:32:32| I remember, I think you said it was 2018, 2019, we had the public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1952)|
| 0:32:37| meeting. I was there with you. Yeah. And I remember that public meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1957)|
| 0:32:41| very distinctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1961)|
| 0:32:45| There were three factions, so to speak. It was homeowners, this neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1965)|
| 0:32:50| and this other neighborhood. And there were several options discussed, but| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1970)|
| 0:32:55| if I remember correctly, nobody wanted to budge. And it was a stalemate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1975)|
| 0:33:00| of, we've got some solutions, we've taken public dollars and allocated to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1980)|
| 0:33:05| try to fix this issue, but nobody could come to a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1985)|
| 0:33:09| I thought those public dollars had been taken back when we walked away,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1989)|
| 0:33:13| but they've been sitting there, apparently. Yeah. And that's true, because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1993)|
| 0:33:19| when there are significant rains, the folks that live out there still call| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=1999)|
| 0:33:23| our office and inquire, so we wanted to present them a solution that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2003)|
| 0:33:27| would prevent the flooding from occurring. And I think we've done that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2007)|
| 0:33:33| but it's got some issues associated with it, unfortunately. So it's gonna| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2013)|
| 0:33:36| flood some way, somehow. It's a matter of what do we do...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2016)|
| 0:33:40| The water's coming. Correct. It's a matter of what do you do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2020)|
| 0:33:43| it. And I remember one of the proposals was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| to obtain a parcel of... A portion of the land that's sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2025)|
| 0:33:49| undeveloped to essentially make a bigger retaining pond or a retaining structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2029)|
| 0:33:56| that would hold more so it wouldn't flood. That was summarily rejected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2036)|
| 0:34:00| There was, I think, another structure, a berm further up. I think that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2040)|
| 0:34:05| was... There were two or three or four. You said you looked at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2045)|
| 0:34:08| 27 options, but I think at the meeting, we had three or four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2048)|
| 0:34:11| different proposals. Okay. So if we do nothing, it's still gonna flood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2051)|
| 0:34:20| and homeowners are still gonna call, and we're... We're sort of right back| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2060)|
| 0:34:26| where we started from three years ago. If we do something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| is there another... Obviously, you brought in a geotech| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2070)|
| 0:34:36| consultant. When I met the gentleman who gave us this documentation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2076)|
| 0:34:40| I said, okay, well, what... Then what? What other alternative is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2080)|
| 0:34:44| Is there any other alternative at this point to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2084)|
| 0:34:49| do anything else other than this? Or is this it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2089)|
| 0:34:55| Is it this or nothing, I guess, is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2095)|
| 0:34:58| I mean, I hate to put it so bluntly, but I think it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2098)|
| 0:35:01| the only really cost effective solution. I mean, there's some other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2101)|
| 0:35:05| options out there, but they're extremely expensive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2105)|
| 0:35:13| that I think it would be... Maybe not very palatable either, so...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2113)|
| 0:35:20| Okay. I guess my last question is for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2120)|
| 0:35:28| Commissioner Lee made the motion to defer. What| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| is deferring for a month offer us? Is there another public meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2131)|
| 0:35:38| Is there just more time to digest what's been going? What does that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2138)|
| 0:35:43| help the situation or... Well... How does it advance the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2143)|
| 0:35:47| I guess? Because next week, if it's voted on, I will not be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2147)|
| 0:35:50| here, and it's in my district, so I want to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2150)|
| 0:35:54| vote on this. Thank you. Thank you, Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2154)|
| 0:36:02| Lee. Commissioner Oster, you're recognized. Mr. Soden, I know this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2162)|
| 0:36:06| I've looked at it. I know that you've also done... You've put a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2166)|
| 0:36:10| pump in for one particular neighbor that was having a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| flooding issues. So I'm kind of playing off Commissioner Jay's question of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2174)|
| 0:36:18| instead of doing the wall, which I understand the homeowners aren't crazy| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2178)|
| 0:36:22| about, and I can understand why. I want to thank you guys for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2182)|
| 0:36:25| coming down here. I know it's a pain to come down here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2185)|
| 0:36:27| on a Monday night at 5 o'clock and park, so thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2187)|
| 0:36:30| for doing that. But is there a way to do more pumps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2190)|
| 0:36:36| as opposed to the wall that's gonna relieve them from having to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2196)|
| 0:36:42| care of any of the equipment, but then also kind of not have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2202)|
| 0:36:47| the eyesore of the flood wall? Because I understand the property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2207)|
| 0:36:52| that does have that property, he doesn't want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2212)|
| 0:36:56| give up some of that property for the pond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2216)|
| 0:37:01| Yeah, we looked at that option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2221)|
| 0:37:10| Yeah, we looked at some... I apologize. We found it would require a very large| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2230)|
| 0:37:19| pump, probably in the neighborhood of two six-inch pumps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2239)|
| 0:37:23| We did look at that. I think we identified it as being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2243)|
| 0:37:29| probably cost prohibitive. I think the numbers we were looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2249)|
| 0:37:35| were like 1.2, 1.3 million. The cost of the wall is probably| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2255)|
| 0:37:39| $400,000 to $500,000, so there was some cost savings there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2259)|
| 0:37:43| So I think that's... I'd want to go back and look a little closer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| at that, but certainly we can solve it with pumps, but the cost of it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2266)|
| 0:37:52| what we felt like was that there was a better option there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| I'm good with deferring it. I think that would give| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| Commissioner Lee more time to talk to you possibly about it, and then also some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2278)|
| 0:38:03| of the homeowners along with the pumps. I mean, I definitely...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2283)|
| 0:38:06| we always want to be cost effective, but we also want to think about the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2286)|
| 0:38:09| homeowners that it's going to affect directly, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2289)|
| 0:38:12| So I'm okay with the deferral until December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2292)|
| 0:38:15| Thank you, Mr. Snowden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2295)|
| 0:38:19| Thank you, Commissioner Oster. Commissioner Lee, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2299)|
| 0:38:22| Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Snowden, I met with these folks. First of all, if I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2302)|
| 0:38:27| could recognize them, could you all stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| Stand up, everyone who came out tonight. Thank you for coming. Y'all can sit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2309)|
| 0:38:37| When I met with them, if I'm not incorrect, is the homeowner that this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2317)|
| 0:38:43| directly affects, that she doesn't want the pump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2323)|
| 0:38:49| or the wall on her property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2329)|
| 0:38:55| She expressed that concern, but it will have to be on her property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2335)|
| 0:39:02| to make it a viable solution, Commissioner Lee. So she did express that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2342)|
| 0:39:05| concern, but it would have to reside at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2345)|
| 0:39:08| partially on her property, yes ma'am. And the field that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2348)|
| 0:39:12| is there, most of that wall would be on Mr. Bright's property, isn't that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2352)|
| 0:39:17| That would take approximately, what, three acres out of his five acres for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2357)|
| 0:39:20| that wall? That sounds about right, yes ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2360)|
| 0:39:24| And also, if these, the people that are here tonight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2364)|
| 0:39:30| if they don't sign off on it, is it my understanding that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2370)|
| 0:39:34| the county won't do anything if they say, no, we don't want this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2374)|
| 0:39:38| That is correct. The agreements that were drafted by the legal department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2378)|
| 0:39:42| would have to be agreed to in principle by both, not only the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2382)|
| 0:39:47| county, but them, yes ma'am. So if they don't sign off on it, it's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2387)|
| 0:39:51| no-go? Yes ma'am. Okay, thank you, Mr. Stone. Thank you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| Madam Chair. Thank you, Commissioner Lee. Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2395)|
| 0:39:58| Daley, you're recognized. Thank you, Madam Chair. Jim, did I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2398)|
| 0:40:02| understand you correctly that the property owner will be responsible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2402)|
| 0:40:06| for the pump? Yes. How can you do that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2406)|
| 0:40:12| When I say a pump, these are like small pumps you would buy at Home Depot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2412)|
| 0:40:16| They're not anything that I don't think a homeowner wouldn't be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2416)|
| 0:40:21| capable of maintaining. Because one, and the reason being is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2421)|
| 0:40:26| you know, obviously when we get a big rain, you know, we have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2426)|
| 0:40:30| a lot of areas in the county that we got to dispatch crews to and things and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2430)|
| 0:40:34| you know, these folks here live there. They know when the water's rising and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| falling, so they would have a better idea of when to initiate that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2438)|
| 0:40:43| pumping much more than us and have the capability to in those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2443)|
| 0:40:46| situations. In my former career, when you say pump,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2446)|
| 0:40:53| I'm talking about a U.S. motor pump that pumps water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2453)|
| 0:40:57| And when you say Home Depot, I look at a little sub-pump| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2457)|
| 0:41:01| that goes in a basement. Are we somewhere in between?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2461)|
| 0:41:05| We are. It would be something about the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2465)|
| 0:41:08| I mean, about the size, two people could pick it up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2468)|
| 0:41:11| Probably like a two-inch little water pump at Home Depot. And,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2471)|
| 0:41:15| you know, the pumping behind the wall is not even| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2475)|
| 0:41:20| necessary. I mean, if they didn't pump behind the wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| it wouldn't flood their home. It would just be nuisance water pounded up in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2485)|
| 0:41:28| their backyard. So it's not as if the pumping is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| absolutely necessary. We just want to provide them the opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2492)|
| 0:41:36| to, you know, get rid of that nuisance water.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2496)|
| 0:41:41| It's clear as bud to me. Maybe we might defer it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2501)|
| 0:41:45| even farther than December, as far as that goes, because I'd like to go out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| and look at it myself. I just can't imagine| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2508)|
| 0:41:51| Knox County coming to me and telling me that I've got to put a pump in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| They're going to put a pump in and I've got to take care of the rest of my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2514)|
| 0:41:58| board days. I just don't see that. I mean, I may be wrong, but that's, no, let's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2518)|
| 0:42:03| go ahead. If we're going to do something like that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| we can condemn the property and do the catch basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| I mean, so I would even suggest that you defer it because we've got short| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2529)|
| 0:42:16| weeks coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2536)|
| 0:42:21| Thank you, Commissioner Daley. For those commissioners who've already spoken,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2541)|
| 0:42:26| I'm going to go to the ones who have not yet. So, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2546)|
| 0:42:30| I was going to ask, Shirley, are you not for this, basically, then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2550)|
| 0:42:34| I am not for this at all. Should we just, it's up to you, do you just make a motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2554)|
| 0:42:40| to cancel it and see if you have the votes to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2560)|
| 0:42:42| to shoot it down at this point, or do you want to? Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2562)|
| 0:42:45| I can make a substitute motion to deny this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2565)|
| 0:42:49| Do you want to second it? I'll second it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2569)|
| 0:42:53| Did you make it? So, that's your motion. Yeah, that's my motion, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2573)|
| 0:42:56| The motion on the floor, the substitute motion on the floor is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2576)|
| 0:42:59| deny this by Commissioner Ward with a second by Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2579)|
| 0:43:07| I think it would have to be a second because you are the current| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2587)|
| 0:43:13| maker of the original motion, so it would need to be a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2593)|
| 0:43:16| Do you want to just motion? I can second. I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2596)|
| 0:43:20| We'll second the substitute motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2600)|
| 0:43:26| There are still lights on. Commissioner Hill, since you have not spoken, I will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2606)|
| 0:43:30| defer to you, then Commissioner Schoenmaker and Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2610)|
| 0:43:34| I know the flood of 2019 was an exception, so has this particular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2614)|
| 0:43:42| property had had multiple problems in the past, or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2622)|
| 0:43:46| was it just this event that is prompting everything we're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| talking about? Yeah, to my understanding, and some of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| the residents here may know better than I, but probably do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2635)|
| 0:43:59| know better than I, but there was four homes flooded in 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2639)|
| 0:44:03| one home flooded in 2020, and I think there's been a couple of close instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2643)|
| 0:44:06| since then. So, that's my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2646)|
| 0:44:11| knowledge of history of that, Commissioner Hill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2651)|
| 0:44:13| Would you know, was there new construction or development or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2653)|
| 0:44:19| something that occurred that suddenly made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2659)|
| 0:44:24| this flooding be a problem? Not tremendously. We went back and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2664)|
| 0:44:29| looked at aerial photography. There hasn't been a significant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2669)|
| 0:44:34| increase in, you know, impervious area or something that would generate a lot of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2674)|
| 0:44:38| runoff. We just think it's a situation where, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2678)|
| 0:44:42| know, in both instances in 2019 and 2020, we saw the majority of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| our problems where it was related to sinkholes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2687)|
| 0:44:50| and we just think that, you know, the ground, we had very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2690)|
| 0:44:53| a lot of wet preceding events, so the groundwater was really high,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2693)|
| 0:44:58| and there just was very little infiltration, so it was kind of a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| perfect storm, unfortunately, that resulted in both these issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2702)|
| 0:45:06| So, is it, is our understanding to be if,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2706)|
| 0:45:12| I mean, I'm hearing homeowners say they don't, they don't want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2712)|
| 0:45:15| I'm hearing you say that part of the agreement would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2715)|
| 0:45:19| then don't call us. If it's rejected, you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2719)|
| 0:45:26| that's, I mean, that's it. You've offered solutions and they don't want it, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2726)|
| 0:45:30| I don't mean to sound harsh when I say that, but that is, in fact,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| you take this or you'll just have to figure it out on your own,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| but it will no longer be Knox County's problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2737)|
| 0:45:41| Yeah, I mean, and certainly we, you know, I want to find a solution here that's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2741)|
| 0:45:45| agreeable. Oh, I know you do. I do, you know, but to your point, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2745)|
| 0:45:50| to put it bluntly, yes, I mean, you know, we've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| offered a solution and, you know, they don't like that, and that's fine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2753)|
| 0:45:57| but if, you know, in absence of that and the budget we have, we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2757)|
| 0:46:03| another solution that fits that budget. All right, I just,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| that's from a homeowner's standpoint, that would be a huge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2768)|
| 0:46:13| thing I would think to be forfeiting, but again, it's not, it's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2773)|
| 0:46:19| where I live, but that's just my comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2779)|
| 0:46:23| Thank you, Commissioner Hill. Commissioner Schoonmaker. Thank you, Madam Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2783)|
| 0:46:27| Director Snowden, did you get a copy of what the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2787)|
| 0:46:31| homeowners distributed? Yes, Paul, Director Boot gave me that, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2791)|
| 0:46:36| believe. Okay, could you look at the last four| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2796)|
| 0:46:40| color photos in the document, and my question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2800)|
| 0:46:45| is, when you see the amount of water here, what is the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2805)|
| 0:46:50| normal time, in your best estimate, that this water recedes down to zero?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2810)|
| 0:46:58| I'm sorry, Commissioner. When you look at the photos,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2818)|
| 0:47:01| are you on the page with the photos? Yes, sir. Okay, when you see that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2821)|
| 0:47:06| how long would it take for that water to recede| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2826)|
| 0:47:09| once the event is over with? Oh, well, it depends on the preceding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2829)|
| 0:47:15| rain, because it all depends on, because at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2835)|
| 0:47:18| this point, it doesn't run off. I mean, it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2838)|
| 0:47:22| compounded there, so it all depends on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2842)|
| 0:47:25| infiltration rate of the soil. It might be, you know, if it's been| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2845)|
| 0:47:29| relatively dry and the soil can accept that moisture, it might be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2849)|
| 0:47:33| you know, a day or two days. If it's been really, really wet, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2853)|
| 0:47:38| know, it might be a week, so it just depends, unfortunately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| Okay, and if you did install a wall with this kind of waterfall| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2863)|
| 0:47:50| and the rain being held back from the wall,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2870)|
| 0:47:53| is this something that you'd end up with a potential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2873)|
| 0:47:57| situation where you could have mosquitoes breeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2877)|
| 0:48:01| that would affect the neighborhood? I mean, certainly, there's standing waters| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2881)|
| 0:48:04| at potential. I mean, we could work with the health department, and there are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2884)|
| 0:48:08| tablets that they can install in there, but, you know, that is a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2888)|
| 0:48:11| concern, yes. Okay, and then I would like to ask the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| neighborhood representative if they understand that if we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| kill this measure, that it's not going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| resolved. Do they understand what's going on here? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2903)|
| 0:48:30| Sir, if you wouldn't mind, again, to state your name. Yes, my name is Bardo, and I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2910)|

| 0:48:48| We would like to see something looked at from the county as to what to do with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2928)|
| 0:48:53| the source of the water. It's still, it just, I don't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2933)|
| 0:48:57| why we are not looking at the source of the water, because the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2937)|
| 0:49:01| water, there has been substantial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2941)|
| 0:49:04| and the Sharon Baptist Church built a large parking lot. All of that water| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2944)|
| 0:49:10| from that parking lot is now being shed into that basin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2950)|
| 0:49:13| Mendenhall Estates, which is 60 homes, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2953)|
| 0:49:17| some of the water on the back side of that is shed into that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2957)|
| 0:49:21| that wasn't before. Now, Quail Run sheds into it also, but that's been there for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2961)|
| 0:49:25| long time. So there is new development that has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| caused the basin to get larger. In answer to one of your questions was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| is the, how often does this do this? The last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2973)|
| 0:49:36| time it did it was 1999. I live there, I've lived there for almost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2976)|
| 0:49:40| 30 years. The water was at not quite as high as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2980)|
| 0:49:46| the 1080 mark. It was a little bit lower than that. It maybe got a foot| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2986)|

| 0:49:59| Depot pumps and keeping the basin down low enough to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=2999)|
| 0:50:03| keep it out of the person that's mostly affected| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3003)|

| 0:50:20| don't want the wall in their backyard. I've talked to one of the other| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3020)|

| 0:51:22| Thank you. And then last question for Mr. Snowden. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3082)|
| 0:51:25| the homeowner brought up the point about new development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| an expansion of a church parking lot or whatever, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| they're not able to keep the water on their property. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| is that, are there future developments planned in this area where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3095)|
| 0:51:39| it's going to get worse? And I believe we looked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3099)|
| 0:51:46| at those aerials. There was a, I think Sharon Baptist did do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3106)|
| 0:51:53| some work that added some impervious area, but that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3113)|
| 0:51:56| I think maybe even before the adoption of our stormwater ordinance, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3116)|
| 0:52:00| that may have kind of preceded that. But yes, to your point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3120)|
| 0:52:03| if a development came in there that's in this watershed that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3123)|
| 0:52:09| drain to there, our sinkhole ordinance is much more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3129)|
| 0:52:13| robust now than it was back, you know, I mean before 2008| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3133)|
| 0:52:17| didn't even really exist, but now we assume| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3137)|
| 0:52:22| or we make the designer assume plug conditions. So anytime your site that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3142)|
| 0:52:26| you're developing drains to a sinkhole, you know, typically we let you reduce| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3146)|
| 0:52:31| water down, you know, the volume stays the same, but we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3151)|
| 0:52:34| adjust the rate for the design storms. In a sinkhole drainage area like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3154)|
| 0:52:40| this, if somebody develops upstream of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3160)|
| 0:52:43| they won't be able to release that water in the same way. So instead of having a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3163)|
| 0:52:47| regular detention basin, their basin won't be able to release| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3167)|
| 0:52:50| water above and beyond what the site did previously. So essentially we're saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3170)|
| 0:52:54| no new net water can come to this point. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3174)|
| 0:52:57| moving forward, there won't be any, the situation won't get any worse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3177)|
| 0:53:02| Okay, thank you, sir. Thank you, Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3182)|
| 0:53:06| Commissioner Jay. Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Snowden, I| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3186)|
| 0:53:10| just, I want to go way back to the beginning of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3190)|
| 0:53:13| This project came up because of the flooding,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3193)|
| 0:53:18| really that was the historic floods of 2019,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3198)|
| 0:53:22| right? I mean, and if I remember correctly, it really was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3202)|
| 0:53:28| the homeowner that looks to be at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3208)|
| 0:53:33| like 975 Anatoly Lane, that real corner, that corner lot, and I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3213)|
| 0:53:39| the gentleman behind lives a couple of, one of the gentlemen here, Mike Helms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3219)|
| 0:53:44| lives 967. They're just up a few houses. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3224)|
| 0:53:49| this wasn't Knox County's responsibility at the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| It was a request that came, we heard the homeowners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3233)|
| 0:53:57| we were dealing with floods all over the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3237)|
| 0:54:01| We did all kinds of stormwater projects to try to help| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| make sure that we could get ahead of it in the future,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| from Dutchtown Road all the way to halls and everywhere in between.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3247)|
| 0:54:11| And so this is one where we said, okay, let's allocate some money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3251)|
| 0:54:14| some public funds to sort of solve this issue, but it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3254)|
| 0:54:17| wasn't like we caused an issue that did something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3257)|
| 0:54:21| A combination of mother nature and a growth of a county. So,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3261)|
| 0:54:25| that correct? Yes, sir. Okay. Everyone that's on this list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3265)|
| 0:54:33| with the exception of maybe one person, weren't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3273)|
| 0:54:37| these weren't the, these aren't, you weren't the folks that were actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3277)|
| 0:54:39| flooded. It came close, but you had a couple people that were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3279)|
| 0:54:43| on that Anatoly Lane, but a lot of folks that are on this are in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3283)|
| 0:54:48| below or the neighborhood on the other side,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3288)|
| 0:54:50| sort of surrounding it, and this whole area sits in the center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3290)|
| 0:54:54| I'm guessing that the calls that you continue to get,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3294)|
| 0:54:56| because I left that public meeting thinking this whole thing was dead and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3296)|
| 0:55:00| we were going to walk away and put the money back into some other stormwater| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| project because nobody could agree on anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3303)|
| 0:55:05| And I'm guessing that the calls come from the resident at 975,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3305)|
| 0:55:09| that corner lot, who wants a solution, but doesn't want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3309)|
| 0:55:16| a solution on their land. Wants a solution, but doesn't want a wall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3316)|
| 0:55:22| So, this is where we ended up in the stalemate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3322)|
| 0:55:24| Nobody wanted to give, the property owner didn't want to sell any land| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3324)|
| 0:55:29| to make a bigger retention pond that would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3329)|
| 0:55:33| Other residents didn't want that. Everyone on Cherish, Grace Way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3333)|
| 0:55:38| that had, those are more recently built homes, a couple of them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3338)|
| 0:55:42| didn't want berms. I mean, this is exactly where we got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3342)|
| 0:55:45| But I want to echo other commissioners that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3345)|
| 0:55:48| that are outlining this, Commissioner Ward and Commissioner Schumacher,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3348)|
| 0:55:52| if this thing dies tonight, we're done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3352)|
| 0:55:56| That money's going to be put somewhere else in Knox County stormwater projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3356)|
| 0:56:01| There's a zillion other projects in the county and we're likely going to just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3361)|
| 0:56:04| move on to the next project because nobody wants to give and there's no solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3364)|
| 0:56:08| anybody can come up with unless you all have a different solution| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3368)|
| 0:56:12| that is cost effective because we didn't put millions and millions of dollars in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3372)|
| 0:56:15| So, if this goes away and you don't hire this company and we don't move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3375)|
| 0:56:22| you're going to focus on new priorities, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3382)|
| 0:56:25| Or other priorities? Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3385)|
| 0:56:27| Okay. I just want to say that out loud one more time because if we have another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3387)|
| 0:56:32| unprecedented rain and this whole area floods again, which is going to flood again at some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3392)|
| 0:56:35| point, and everybody from all of your neighborhoods, north, south, east, and west,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3395)|
| 0:56:40| come and go, help us with the problem, we're going to say, sorry, we tried.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3400)|
| 0:56:45| And we, you know, there's no give. I just want to say that out loud because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3405)|
| 0:56:50| we're going to be here again in a couple of years, I promise you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3410)|
| 0:56:53| So, I'm happy to support that. I've been involved with this for many,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3413)|
| 0:56:58| many years. I just want to make sure that we're all very clear because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3418)|
| 0:57:02| history repeats itself, unfortunately. So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3422)|
| 0:57:05| Thank you, Commissioner Jay. Commissioner Frazier, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| Thank you, Madam Chair. And I do want to thank Director Snowden for all the work that you've| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3429)|
| 0:57:13| put into this. And I want to thank the citizens. Thank you so much for providing this information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3433)|
| 0:57:18| I know this is costly to provide color copies and I really want you to hear that we understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3438)|
| 0:57:25| your concerns and we are extremely sympathetic. And just an apology to you all that you are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3445)|
| 0:57:31| experiencing these issues. My question is this. I was looking at the historical aerials and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3451)|
| 0:57:39| one of you mentioned, you know, why aren't we looking at the source of the water?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3459)|
| 0:57:43| Director Snowden, my question is, I'm seeing activity, development activities, 2003-2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3463)|
| 0:57:50| My question is, do you think there was something more that we could have done at the time of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3470)|
| 0:57:55| development projects that could have prevented this? Because we do tend to see this kind of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3475)|
| 0:58:02| result all over the county after development projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| Our stormwater ordinance was adopted in 2008. I don't know exactly what the, I think we had a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3487)|
| 0:58:14| flood prevention ordinance before that, but it wasn't near as robust. So you're right, 2003-2007,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3494)|
| 0:58:22| that predates our stormwater ordinance. So, I mean, you know, hindsight being 2020,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3502)|
| 0:58:28| you know, a lot of this maybe wouldn't have happened with those improved standards. But| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3508)|
| 0:58:34| I mean, I think that moving forward, obviously, we're going to be very cautious of this area and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3514)|
| 0:58:40| make sure that any development that occurs in this drainage area, you know, is really retaining| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3520)|
| 0:58:46| water rather than detaining it. They're not releasing water downstream. So to answer the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3526)|
| 0:58:51| citizens' questions about the source of the water, we really don't know. Well, it's that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3531)|
| 0:58:59| 42-acre upstream drainage area that includes about 20 acres on either side of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3539)|
| 0:59:05| Some of it's still pasture land and some of its developments was kind of a combination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3545)|
| 0:59:12| It's, you know, there isn't a real quick descriptive answer to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3552)|
| 0:59:18| Thank you, and thank you all again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3558)|
| 0:59:23| Thank you, Commissioner Frazier. Is there any more discussion regarding this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3563)|
| 0:59:29| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3569)|
| 0:59:31| The motion is to, the substitute motion is to deny this moving forward. Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3571)|
| 0:59:40| Just a point of order. Mr. Law Director, can we kill this tonight or does it really need to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3580)|
| 0:59:45| voted on next Monday? You can vote this way tonight how you want, but as I just told the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3585)|
| 0:59:50| chairman and told the maker of the motion, it has to be on the agenda at the next meeting because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3590)|
| 0:59:56| that's the only meeting you can vote up or down on a particular resolution. So the effect of this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3596)|
| 1:00:04| motion made by the commissioner is, in fact, to not approve it for the consent calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3604)|
| 1:00:12| which means it's going to be, in whatever way, words he used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3612)|
| 1:00:15| Can I make a motion not to move it forward then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3615)|
| 1:00:19| No, you have to take action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3619)|

| 1:00:22| Without recommending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| Hey, hold on guys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3627)|
| 1:00:29| No, no, not under, that's what I was looking at these rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3629)|
| 1:00:34| Commissioner Daley has the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3634)|
| 1:00:35| Thank you. So to clarify, if we vote no tonight, it's still got to go for a vote Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3635)|
| 1:00:43| Right, and what the commissioner said was he would agree to make a motion to send it on without,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3643)|
| 1:00:52| you can't vote up or down on any resolution at this meeting. It has to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3652)|
| 1:00:58| I know what the sense of this board is and what the vote's going to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3658)|
| 1:01:02| come next Monday unless something drastically changes. So basically, the simplest way is to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3662)|
| 1:01:08| send it forward without recommendation and it's on the agenda and then it's voted up or down next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3668)|
| 1:01:13| Well, I would like to hear from Commissioner Lee if that's okay with her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3673)|
| 1:01:19| You know, you're the one who wanted to be here to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| You say you're not going to be here next Monday, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| No, I won't be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3683)|
| 1:01:25| I won't be here this next Monday and I don't,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3685)|
| 1:01:30| you know, I can't guarantee that I'm going to, we're going to have the votes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3690)|
| 1:01:34| But you can't vote up or down on a resolution at this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3694)|
| 1:01:37| That's the technicality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3697)|
| 1:01:38| I hate that technicality's there because I got a sense of what the commission wants to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3698)|
| 1:01:44| Uh, somehow I don't think that your original motion would be in danger next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3704)|
| 1:01:51| I don't get the sense that it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3711)|
| 1:01:55| The original motion was to defer to December.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3715)|
| 1:01:58| Then we got a substitute motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| Still have to vote on it next month. You understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| So, what's your pleasure? Defer or vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| Basically, I would be voting yes to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3728)|
| 1:02:16| Yeah, you'd be voting yes to deny, make a motion to deny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3736)|
| 1:02:20| Okay, I guess we'll do it Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| Vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3743)|
| 1:02:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3744)|
| 1:02:25| The maker of the motion needs to do it as a recommend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3745)|
| 1:02:29| no recommendation, so we can vote it on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3749)|
| 1:02:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3752)|
| 1:02:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| I can, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3755)|
| 1:02:38| Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3758)|
| 1:02:39| Well, I just want, I mean, I can't speak for our law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3759)|
| 1:02:43| He may not have been in that seat at the time, but I just know there have been at least two times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3763)|
| 1:02:47| since I've been on this body when we made a motion to move something forward with no| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3767)|
| 1:02:51| recommendation and it failed and it did not make the agenda for that reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3771)|
| 1:02:56| That's, that's what you said. That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3776)|
| 1:02:59| So, you can't, if it's on the agenda, you can't vote it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| You can't vote it up or down until the actual meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3783)|
| 1:03:07| Right, but if the motion is to move it forward with no recommendation and that fails,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3787)|
| 1:03:13| then in the past it has not moved forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3793)|
| 1:03:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3796)|
| 1:03:18| So, it would not be on next week's agenda if we, if the motion to move forward fails.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3798)|
| 1:03:26| That's what's happened a couple of times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3806)|
| 1:03:29| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3809)|
| 1:03:30| Of our rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3810)|

| 1:04:05| I got it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3845)|
| 1:04:08| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3848)|
| 1:04:08| That's fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3848)|

| 1:04:27| If I remember correctly, one other option was Knox County essentially offered to buy a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| significant chunk of this flooded land and turn it into a, you know, dig it out and turn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3872)|
| 1:04:37| it into a stormwater park or a, a, a much nicer looking retention pond that was more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3877)|
| 1:04:45| like Roy Arthur's stormwater park that collects water and prevents it from flooding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3885)|
| 1:04:49| There was a solution and that was summarily rejected by both her and their surrounding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3889)|
| 1:04:55| neighbors because she didn't want to sell it and nobody else wanted to look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3895)|
| 1:04:58| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3898)|
| 1:05:00| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3900)|
| 1:05:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3900)|
| 1:05:01| So there was, is, and is a solution, but nobody wanted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3901)|
| 1:05:05| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3905)|
| 1:05:05| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3905)|
| 1:05:06| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3908)|
| 1:05:09| Commissioner Schoonmaker, would you like to read the portion of the rule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3909)|
| 1:05:14| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3914)|
| 1:05:14| I'm in a rule book, page seven, nine, eight, seven, nine, eight, seven, nine, eight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3914)|
| 1:05:19| number seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3919)|
| 1:05:20| It says any agenda item that fails in the agenda work session shall be removed from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3920)|
| 1:05:25| the commission agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3925)|
| 1:05:28| So I'll change my motion and move forward without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3928)|
| 1:05:31| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3931)|

| 1:05:35| So the, the amended substitute motion is to move forward with no recommendation by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3935)|
| 1:05:42| Ward with a second by Commissioner Beeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3942)|

| 1:05:46| Is there, if it, if we don't vote yes, if we vote it down, no, then it dies and vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3946)|
| 1:05:55| yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3955)|
| 1:05:56| You're going to get to go back to the original motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3956)|
| 1:05:58| But she can withdraw.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3958)|
| 1:05:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3959)|
| 1:06:00| May I point out something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3960)|
| 1:06:01| If you want to vote this down and you don't want this money to be spent for that project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3961)|
| 1:06:08| simply removing it from the agenda tonight is not going to end it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3968)|
| 1:06:13| If you want to tell the engineering department that you're not going to spend that money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3973)|
| 1:06:19| and you don't want that project, go ahead and send it out without recommendation and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3979)|
| 1:06:24| vote on it at the next meeting and vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3984)|
| 1:06:27| Then it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3987)|
| 1:06:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3988)|
| 1:06:29| So we have to move forward to next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3989)|
| 1:06:31| That's my recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3991)|
| 1:06:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3992)|
| 1:06:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3992)|
| 1:06:33| We can vote on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3993)|
| 1:06:36| Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3996)|
| 1:06:37| I would just like to express that if it were to be sent forward with no recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=3997)|
| 1:06:41| next week, then I would vote it down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4001)|
| 1:06:43| And that's my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4003)|
| 1:06:44| And if others want to opine on such to reassure Commissioner Lee that in her absence, we will| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4004)|

| 1:08:27| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4107)|

| 1:08:31| Thank you, Mr. Myers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4111)|
| 1:08:32| Um, originally in 2009, 13 years ago, Knox County gave the Marble Alley's, aka Mr. Goss,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4112)|
| 1:08:45| the opportunity to purchase these five parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4125)|
| 1:08:49| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4129)|
| 1:08:51| There were 13 in 2009, all of the State Street, what we call the State Street property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4131)|
| 1:08:56| Right, but he only purchased like not or eight of those and there was a balance of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4136)|
| 1:09:02| about five parcels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4142)|
| 1:09:03| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4143)|
| 1:09:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4144)|
| 1:09:06| Since 2009, how many times have we granted an extension to this individual to have the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4146)|
| 1:09:16| opportunity to purchase this Knox County asset?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4156)|
| 1:09:27| It's my understanding that there have been two extensions to this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4167)|
| 1:09:34| So this would be the third?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4174)|
| 1:09:37| This would be the third, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4177)|
| 1:09:39| Okay, but it doesn't go back that there was a, in 2009 there was a two-year, 2011 a two-year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4179)|
| 1:09:46| 2013 a two-year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4186)|
| 1:09:49| I believe so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4189)|
| 1:09:51| I think I've come up with about at least five extensions for this one company to be able to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4191)|
| 1:09:57| opportunity to purchase this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4197)|
| 1:10:01| Does that sound about right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4201)|
| 1:10:04| You said five?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4204)|
| 1:10:08| Like I said, I have two documents of extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| You got the current stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4213)|
| 1:10:14| And there may have been one that was included when we sold the first eight parcels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4214)|
| 1:10:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4219)|
| 1:10:20| There may have been an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4220)|
| 1:10:21| That's something I did not look at, but I will be glad to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4221)|
| 1:10:24| Okay, and then Knox County set the current purchase price in 2009?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4224)|
| 1:10:30| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4230)|
| 1:10:31| Thirteen years ago, with the caveat that the price increase would increase two percent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4231)|
| 1:10:37| per year, which probably makes some sense up to 2015.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4237)|
| 1:10:42| But after 2015, we know that downtown property has pretty much been pretty amazing and what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4242)|
| 1:10:49| that property is, you know, property around that is selling for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4249)|
| 1:10:55| Back in at the work session on November 11th of 2019, you can see the paperwork that was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4255)|
| 1:11:02| presented to you at the finance committee meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4262)|
| 1:11:06| This was the document for his, I believe, fourth extension at that time, and where it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4266)|
| 1:11:14| was decided that he could have up to three consecutive 12-month periods to purchase this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4274)|
| 1:11:22| property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4282)|
| 1:11:24| At that November 11th, 2019 meeting, Commissioner Daley made the recommendation and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4284)|
| 1:11:31| developer agreed, and you can see it in highlighting, and there shall be no additional| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4291)|
| 1:11:38| extensions past December 31st of 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4298)|
| 1:11:45| The commission signed off on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4305)|
| 1:11:47| The developer signed off on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4307)|
| 1:11:49| And again, we still have a piece of property that Knox County owns with no revenue being| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4309)|
| 1:11:56| generated on it, and we've now been holding that for this one developer for 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4316)|
| 1:12:04| I think it's kind of hard when we're supposed to have a fiduciary responsibility to protect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4324)|
| 1:12:11| the taxpayers of Knox County, to continue to allow somebody to continue to just delay,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4331)|
| 1:12:17| delay, delay, and delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4337)|
| 1:12:20| And there's no overwhelming hardship to why you couldn't go down and purchase this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4340)|
| 1:12:29| tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4349)|
| 1:12:31| Now, there's a great article in today's Knoxville News Sentinel about what some proposed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4351)|
| 1:12:38| ideas are for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4358)|
| 1:12:40| But again, none of that has, I don't think, gone through Knox County planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4360)|
| 1:12:45| None of this stuff has been done, and he wants another six-month delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| You know, I just have a hard time when somebody's, when we've given somebody the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4371)|
| 1:12:56| opportunity to buy a county asset that was priced in 2009 to give them 13 years to decide| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4376)|
| 1:13:07| whether he wants to buy it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4387)|
| 1:13:10| And again, Commissioner Daley so eloquently said back in 2019, this is your last chance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4390)|
| 1:13:17| You're not going to get another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| So I'll defer to see if anybody else has any other conversations on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4399)|
| 1:13:25| Commissioner Ward, you're recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4408)|
| 1:13:30| I feel the same way that Commissioner Schoomaker does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4410)|
| 1:13:33| Being in the real estate development world, this should not be a hard deal to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4413)|
| 1:13:42| I would assume, I know we're assuming, but my current wisdom says that that property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4422)|
| 1:13:50| will appraise for a lot more than what we're selling it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4430)|
| 1:13:53| He's already put over $100,000 down on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| It's pretty easy to go to the bank and say, hey, I've got this option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| I already have money down on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4439)|
| 1:14:00| I've got at least 20% into this, 25% into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4440)|
| 1:14:03| It should be very simple if you're a good standing company or a good developer or builder| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4443)|
| 1:14:09| to get a loan fairly easy for a project like that in a booming high-demand area such as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4449)|
| 1:14:15| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4455)|
| 1:14:15| And to give, I mean, 13 years is insane in my professional and personal opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| That's just, I mean, I would love to get 13-year options on properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| That'd be great for no money down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4464)|
| 1:14:26| I mean, shoot, I'd be a billionaire by, you know, in a decade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4466)|
| 1:14:30| But I think Commissioner Schoonmaker stole my line.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4470)|
| 1:14:35| I wanted to use was we have a fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| I don't think extending this is a responsible measure for us as commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4479)|
| 1:14:47| Thank you, Commissioner Ward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4487)|

| 1:15:27| I know you've heard Commissioner Warren's, Commissioner Schoonmaker's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4527)|
| 1:15:31| comments in their reservations about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4531)|
| 1:15:33| Can you explain what's going on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4533)|
| 1:15:37| So I understand where you're coming from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4537)|
| 1:15:39| And those are reasonable comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4539)|
| 1:15:42| The contract that was originally written with extension periods, which are sort of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4542)|
| 1:15:48| natural in real estate contracts, and I would pay money for those extension periods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4548)|
| 1:15:53| So it wasn't like we were contemplating it was going to be done in that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4553)|
| 1:15:57| And I don't know if you recall, but 2009, we were in the middle of the Great Recession.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4557)|
| 1:16:02| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4562)|
| 1:16:02| And so what I said was, hey, listen, if you'll give me time, I'll figure out how to get this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| deal done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| But if you don't, if we wait till we're done with the Great Recession and financing is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4568)|
| 1:16:12| easily done, then we'll start then and it'll take some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4572)|
| 1:16:18| So we proceeded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4578)|
| 1:16:20| And that's when we broke ground in 2014 on Marble Alley Lofts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4580)|
| 1:16:25| And then at the end of that period, there were other deals starting to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4585)|
| 1:16:29| And so it made sense to wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4589)|
| 1:16:32| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4592)|
| 1:16:32| You know, we didn't want to come out competing with other projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4592)|
| 1:16:35| You know, we want things to happen in a timely basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4595)|
| 1:16:38| And so when I asked for the extension, and you're correct, Commissioner Daley said, hey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4598)|
| 1:16:45| Mr. Goss, would you agree this is the last one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4605)|
| 1:16:46| I said, yes, sir, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| However, we were in anticipating pandemic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4608)|
| 1:16:51| And so when I was anticipating in 2020 being able to put together the entire deal, well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4611)|
| 1:16:59| we were all sitting on our hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| Right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4621)|
| 1:17:01| You know, twiddling our thumbs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| And it wasn't until 2021 when everything shaped out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4623)|
| 1:17:08| So what we have been doing, we've hired architects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4628)|
| 1:17:11| They have been working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4631)|
| 1:17:12| It just took a long time to get everything teed up, took a long time to get our surveys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4632)|
| 1:17:16| done, things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4636)|
| 1:17:17| And this is a tight site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4637)|
| 1:17:18| So we're tweaking it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4638)|
| 1:17:20| And what I'm asking today is, sorry, I cannot close it by the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4640)|
| 1:17:27| Because what we need to do is we need to finish the architectural process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| And we're not even halfway through that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4650)|
| 1:17:33| When we finish that, and I can tell you, we're spending a lot of money on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4653)|
| 1:17:37| We've hired Smee Busby and McCarty Hulsep and McCarty to be our architects on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4657)|
| 1:17:42| Then we will go out and go through a permitting process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4662)|
| 1:17:45| At the end of the permitting process, then we'll price it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4665)|
| 1:17:49| Because what we're finding, if we price it before we get to permitting, it changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4669)|
| 1:17:53| things happen, prices go through the roof, and it's already hard to get things financed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4673)|
| 1:17:57| just because of the interest rate environment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4677)|
| 1:17:59| And so that's why I came and I said, hey, listen, you know, to cross my T's and dot my| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4679)|
| 1:18:05| I's, I need just a little more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4685)|
| 1:18:07| And that's why I'm here today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4687)|
| 1:18:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4690)|
| 1:18:12| Thank you, Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4692)|
| 1:18:13| Commissioner Jay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4693)|
| 1:18:14| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4694)|
| 1:18:17| I think one question we need to ask ourselves here is, is it the purchase price that, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4697)|
| 1:18:25| I guess I would ask other commissioners, is it the purchase price set in 2009 that is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| the issue, or is it the agreement in itself?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4711)|
| 1:18:37| I guess I understand both sides of this equation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4717)|
| 1:18:39| I understand the real estate side, and certainly the fiduciary responsibility of our taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4719)|
| 1:18:44| I also understand there's a thousand projects that never even made it out of the pandemic,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4724)|
| 1:18:50| much less everything got delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| So I get that, and I understand that these things take time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4733)|
| 1:18:56| And so I might just sort of throw out, if it's the purchase price that bugs you that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4736)|
| 1:19:02| was set 13 years ago, but we have a bird in the hand of a team that's already doing a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4742)|
| 1:19:09| team that's already invested money, time, and energy and resources to build something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4749)|
| 1:19:14| that's on a path that has a proven and successful project right next door, instead of throwing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| the entire thing out, is there some compromise to say, we have a partner that's already proven| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4760)|
| 1:19:26| themselves next door and has skin in the game and is ready to move forward, then let's find| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4766)|
| 1:19:33| an agreeable purchase price that brings it up to some sort of normal market value, versus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4773)|
| 1:19:40| if everything goes away, then you start from zero.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4780)|
| 1:19:43| Procurement starts from zero, and you go back, and it might be two years before we get another| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4783)|
| 1:19:50| partner that's willing to do anything on that site, if anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| So I just throw that out as perhaps there's a way to satisfy a little bit of both of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4793)|
| 1:20:00| ideas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4800)|
| 1:20:02| I would also like to point out that part of my offering to pay what the appraised value| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4802)|
| 1:20:06| was at the time, the only offer the county had received was $465,000 for the entire block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4806)|
| 1:20:13| Say that again, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4813)|
| 1:20:16| Whenever I agreed to pay what the appraised value was at the time, the only offer that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4816)|
| 1:20:21| had been received prior to that was $465,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4821)|
| 1:20:26| Nobody wanted the site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4826)|
| 1:20:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4828)|
| 1:20:31| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4831)|
| 1:20:33| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4833)|
| 1:20:36| Mr. Goss, you and I talked last month sometime, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4840)|
| 1:20:40| And, you know, I consider 2020 a lost year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4840)|
| 1:20:47| This is 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4847)|
| 1:20:50| You've had a year and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4850)|
| 1:20:52| Now interest rates are, what, 7%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4852)|
| 1:20:54| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4854)|
| 1:20:55| Going to go up even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4855)|
| 1:20:56| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4856)|
| 1:20:56| Going to go up even more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4856)|
| 1:20:57| It's going to cost you more money to go buy, or I'm sorry, to go borrow that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4857)|
| 1:21:04| And I was the one that held you feet to the fire.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4864)|
| 1:21:09| And I still got to, you know, I feel like the others, we've got a responsibility to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4869)|
| 1:21:14| the taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4874)|
| 1:21:15| Do I think these five lots are worth more than $1,009,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4875)|
| 1:21:21| Absolutely, I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| I answered Mr. J, yeah, I got heartburn about this was the last one you said it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4883)|
| 1:21:30| Now we want six more months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4890)|
| 1:21:32| I got heartburn because I think we won't get more than a million dollars for those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4892)|
| 1:21:37| And if we wait two years, we ain't lost anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| If it takes two years to put it on the market and sell, what have we lost?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4901)|
| 1:21:46| You know, I'm willing to take that gamble, that if you can't do it by December 31st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| get you a partner or whatever, I'm willing to take that gamble that we're going to get| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| more than a million dollars for those lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| So I guess you're figuring out now, and I apologize, I told you on the phone that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4918)|
| 1:22:05| no, we met in person, didn't we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4925)|
| 1:22:08| Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4928)|
| 1:22:08| I think we met in person, if I'm not mistaken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4928)|
| 1:22:10| Yes, sir, we did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4930)|
| 1:22:11| Yeah, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4931)|
| 1:22:12| We did meet in person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4932)|
| 1:22:13| And I told you at that point in time, I felt like that 2020 was a throwaway year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4933)|
| 1:22:18| And I could possibly look at doing the six months, but, you know, you really lost your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4938)|
| 1:22:25| opportunity in 2021 and early 2022 before interest rates started.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| Interest rates were at zero point something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| So you're probably figuring out how I'm going about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4954)|
| 1:22:36| So I think either you do it by December 31st, or the taxpayers need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4956)|
| 1:22:48| Is there any more discussion regarding this item?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4968)|
| 1:22:52| Seeing none, the motion is to move forward with no recommendation by Commissioner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4972)|
| 1:22:56| Schoonmaker, with a second by Commissioner Lundy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4976)|
| 1:22:59| All those in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4979)|
| 1:23:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4981)|
| 1:23:01| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4981)|
| 1:23:03| That motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=4983)|

| 1:23:29| Commissioners, I pulled this off of consent just so Commissioner Jay could give us an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5009)|
| 1:23:35| He and I and several other commissioners met last month to work out the particulars of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5015)|
| 1:23:41| And I think it's going to be a really good program for those youth that do get involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5021)|
| 1:23:46| So Commissioner Jay, you have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5028)|

| 1:23:53| We had a good, robust discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5033)|
| 1:23:56| And the updates are obviously tonight or this month would codify the program as written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5036)|
| 1:24:04| This junior education civic program would be an annual model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5044)|
| 1:24:09| And we'll certainly learn a lot in the first year, but I think it's a good way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5049)|
| 1:24:14| We've left the resolution fairly vague to give us opportunities to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| sort of adapt the program as we see fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5059)|
| 1:24:21| But we broke down the details on the schedule, when it would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5061)|
| 1:24:29| We decided to centralize the application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5069)|
| 1:24:34| Reach out to Zach Webb and his team at the IT department, and should be meeting with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5074)|
| 1:24:38| them this week to give them the details on a central application process where we would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5078)|
| 1:24:43| add a page to our website that would be a description, what it was all about, how to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5083)|
| 1:24:47| apply.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5087)|
| 1:24:48| And then it would actually be an application form that could be filled out right online| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| that would give all the details.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5092)|
| 1:24:53| And then you would put the word out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5093)|
| 1:24:56| People would apply in your district or in your countywide, in our case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| And then those would be filtered to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5101)|
| 1:25:04| And then we had a breakdown of essentially opening it up in December and then making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5104)|
| 1:25:10| our selections and starting it and doing it in the beginning in January.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5110)|
| 1:25:16| It would be January, February, and March over a three-month period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5116)|
| 1:25:20| And then welcoming our junior commissioners through a series of official events here with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5120)|
| 1:25:26| the county, also with maybe a meeting or an event in the public or out in the public with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5126)|
| 1:25:32| you at one of the things that we often do in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5132)|
| 1:25:36| And then, of course, some orientation and final sessions here where they would actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5136)|
| 1:25:40| sit on stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5140)|
| 1:25:41| And even some of our commissioners offered to put together a little mock commission meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5141)|
| 1:25:46| with an agenda for them to learn what it might be and actually tackle some real-life scenarios.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5146)|
| 1:25:52| So good, robust discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| I expect after this month of sort of making it official, of getting that website up in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| draft form to be able to send you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5161)|
| 1:26:03| It'll have the details and the qualifications and everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5163)|
| 1:26:06| And then do some final tweaks in essentially about a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5166)|
| 1:26:10| I think it was December 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5170)|
| 1:26:11| I'm looking for my particular date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5171)|
| 1:26:13| But I think it was December 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5173)|
| 1:26:15| We would sort of make it go live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5175)|
| 1:26:18| And then you'd have the rest of the month to promote and get your junior commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5178)|
| 1:26:23| applications in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5183)|
| 1:26:24| So it's on its way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5184)|
| 1:26:27| Thank you, Commissioner Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5187)|

| 1:30:38| And this, correct me if I'm wrong, Commissioner Lundy, this is because we moved our commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5438)|

| 1:32:17| Commission, if you have not done so to complete the retreat survey that was sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5537)|
| 1:32:26| Madam clerk, we had one item discussion item that was added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5546)|
| 1:32:30| That is discussion regarding El Tequila restaurant and halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5550)|
| 1:32:36| Commissioner Lee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5556)|
| 1:32:38| Thank you, Madam chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5558)|
| 1:32:40| I would, based upon a report from officer Lawson at the El Teco location and halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5560)|
| 1:32:48| there's been a number of fights, reports of children in strollers being there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5568)|
| 1:32:55| And I have a request to make, have the clerk send a certified copy for the El Tequila location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5575)|
| 1:33:03| to appear before the beer board next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| On Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5586)|
| 1:33:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5587)|
| 1:33:08| Law director is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5588)|
| 1:33:10| If you want me to draft a letter for the clerk, I'm more than happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5590)|
| 1:33:14| If I'm wondering about the timeframe of being, getting it done and getting it done by next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5594)|
| 1:33:21| Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5601)|
| 1:33:22| And this is a request from Lieutenant Lawson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5602)|
| 1:33:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5605)|
| 1:33:28| I mean, I'll be glad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5608)|
| 1:33:33| I could get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5613)|
| 1:33:34| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5614)|
| 1:33:34| And that's a good point that commissioner Schoonmaker made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5614)|
| 1:33:37| If, if officer Lawson could hand deliver a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5617)|
| 1:33:42| I don't know if there's any way we can force them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5622)|
| 1:33:45| Is detective Brian Cole here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5625)|
| 1:33:51| He was supposed to be here from the sheriff department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5631)|
| 1:33:58| I'll do from our office, as far as drafting anything for the clerk to send out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5638)|
| 1:34:03| I'll do whatever this, this body wants me to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5643)|
| 1:34:06| And I get the sense of this body and the chairman read to me the email from officer Lawson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5646)|
| 1:34:12| which was very enlightening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5652)|
| 1:34:14| And.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5654)|
| 1:34:16| Shall I read it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5657)|
| 1:34:17| Why don't you read that in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5657)|
| 1:34:21| This is from Lieutenant Lawson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5661)|
| 1:34:23| He says there have been multiple reports of fights and calls for service because of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5663)|
| 1:34:27| noise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5667)|
| 1:34:28| He let me skip the business only operates from Friday on Friday and Saturday nights from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5668)|
| 1:34:36| 10 PM to 3 AM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5676)|
| 1:34:39| There are reports of children and strollers being at the bar as late as 2 AM.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5679)|
| 1:34:45| And he said he was told that we would need to make a motion at this meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5685)|
| 1:34:51| requesting the clerk's office to draft a letter to be sent by certified mail,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5691)|
| 1:34:54| requesting the beer permit holder to appear before the beer, the beer board in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5694)|
| 1:35:01| And office detective Cole, I guess, is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5701)|
| 1:35:06| He said he would be here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5706)|
| 1:35:09| But he said he will have all the calls for service and reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5709)|
| 1:35:13| to, to this body before next Monday regarding this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5713)|
| 1:35:19| Well, it's not that they have the state beer laws, what governs us, and that's not one of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5719)|
| 1:35:25| in there, you can make him show up and explain himself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5725)|
| 1:35:29| There's other options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5729)|
| 1:35:31| It's, it's a noise option.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5731)|
| 1:35:33| It's a public nuisance and what have you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5733)|
| 1:35:37| But if, if, and the detective is the one that's responsible for going out and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5737)|
| 1:35:44| getting these beer sales to minors, and he's very good at it, and he's very,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5744)|
| 1:35:50| he knows he can't cite them for that, but he would like them to appear before the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5750)|
| 1:35:56| which is this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5756)|
| 1:35:57| I have no problem with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5757)|
| 1:35:59| And I'll be glad to draft whatever letter for the clerk to get out or give to the, to Officer Lawson to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5759)|
| 1:36:07| to hand deliver to him and see, see what happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5767)|
| 1:36:10| And I would, the substance of what the chair just read is what would be the substance of the letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5770)|
| 1:36:18| And he also makes reference to this location being more of a nightclub than a restaurant,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5778)|
| 1:36:23| since it is only open on two nights from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5783)|
| 1:36:30| Commissioner Lee, may I yield to other commissioners, or would you like to go ahead?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5790)|
| 1:36:35| Commissioner Lee, may I yield to other commissioners, or would you like to continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5795)|
| 1:36:40| No, you may yield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5800)|
| 1:36:42| Commissioner Oster, were you talking about this or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5802)|
| 1:36:46| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5806)|
| 1:36:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5807)|
| 1:36:50| Commissioner Day, Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5810)|
| 1:36:53| Thank you, Madam Clerk, or Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5813)|
| 1:36:55| I'm just, I guess I'm confused.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5815)|
| 1:36:57| So there's not been a citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5817)|
| 1:37:00| There's no, there's no law that's been broken that would normally before the beer board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5820)|
| 1:37:04| Correct. There is no beer citation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5824)|
| 1:37:05| It is more, I think, as a matter of, we are getting these calls about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5825)|
| 1:37:12| fights and things that are due to maybe intoxication,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5832)|
| 1:37:17| but just to really have them appear before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5837)|
| 1:37:22| is what Lieutenant Lawson is requesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5842)|
| 1:37:24| Is there anything in our beer board laws or ordinance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| I mean, are we just going to come up to read them right act, or is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5846)|
| 1:37:29| I mean, is there anything that we have the power to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5849)|
| 1:37:32| No, not from the beer board, you do not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5852)|
| 1:37:34| You're limited under the state law to what you can do on the beer board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5854)|
| 1:37:38| and that's why Officer Lawson has asked for him to appear because he knows he can't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5858)|
| 1:37:44| Now, a police officer or sheriff's deputy out there that views something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5864)|
| 1:37:49| he can cite them for a violation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5869)|
| 1:37:52| So he hasn't done that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5872)|
| 1:37:53| It's just complaints that he's gotten about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5873)|
| 1:37:55| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5875)|
| 1:37:56| Because I imagine if he found a baby in a stroller at a bar at 2 a.m. in the morning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5876)|
| 1:38:00| he'd probably do something about that, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5880)|
| 1:38:02| But I say he called DCS real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5882)|
| 1:38:05| Yeah, so we're okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5885)|
| 1:38:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5888)|
| 1:38:09| Commissioner Jay, I'm going on the assumption that we would approach this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5889)|
| 1:38:13| with the beer permit holder appearing before us as a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5893)|
| 1:38:17| this is what we expect as a permit holder in Knox County to be able to sell beer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5897)|
| 1:38:23| And again, reiterate that it is a privilege to be able to sell beer in Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5903)|
| 1:38:29| and that we expect these certain things to occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5909)|
| 1:38:33| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5913)|
| 1:38:35| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5915)|
| 1:38:37| Mr. Law Director, are we getting into violation of notice of five days or something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5917)|
| 1:38:45| I know that it's printed in the...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5925)|
| 1:38:48| Well, like I said, I think it's a little short notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5928)|
| 1:38:50| but I mean, we're not citing him to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5930)|
| 1:38:52| So it's not a due process issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5932)|
| 1:38:54| They're asking him to appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5934)|
| 1:38:57| He may not appear.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5937)|
| 1:38:58| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5938)|
| 1:38:59| I think that, you know, I'm for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5939)|
| 1:39:01| Send a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5941)|
| 1:39:01| If he shows up, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5941)|
| 1:39:04| If he don't show up, then we're going to have to make him show up in December somehow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5944)|
| 1:39:11| That would be...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5951)|
| 1:39:12| I'll look and see exactly what the state law allows on that until he's cited for...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5952)|
| 1:39:18| It'd be great if he was cited for a violation for sale to a minor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5958)|
| 1:39:23| Boy, that'd be an automatic right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5963)|
| 1:39:26| I'm like Mr. Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5966)|
| 1:39:27| I can't believe that if it's that bad that there's not been some citation, some type of arrest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5967)|
| 1:39:33| and then it needs to go to the Attorney General to shut it down as a nuisance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5973)|
| 1:39:39| The Attorney General could do it by way of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5979)|
| 1:39:41| And I'm no expert on Attorney General's powers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5981)|
| 1:39:44| but they did...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5984)|
| 1:39:45| What was it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5985)|
| 1:39:46| The gentleman there on Alcoa Highway?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5986)|
| 1:39:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5989)|
| 1:39:51| The AG came in and closed it down as a nuisance and something else.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5991)|
| 1:39:56| Now, that would be the best way, the simplest way to go,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=5996)|
| 1:40:01| but our powers are limited on this commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6001)|
| 1:40:05| Limited.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6005)|
| 1:40:10| Because you've got to have certain debt for a certain period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6010)|
| 1:40:14| I represented municipalities before I came on here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6014)|
| 1:40:20| and we had that problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| You just...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6022)|
| 1:40:22| It's almost impossible to do, but hopefully...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6022)|
| 1:40:27| And I'm sure that Lieutenant Alston would love to find a sale to a minor out there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6027)|
| 1:40:34| and if he did, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6034)|
| 1:40:37| But the AG is a good way to go, so we may want to talk to Charm Allen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6037)|
| 1:40:41| but I have no problem with telling him he needs to show up here in front of this board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6041)|
| 1:40:47| But we can't take away his license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6047)|
| 1:40:49| Under state law, there's only certain things that you can do to revoke a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6049)|
| 1:40:57| Commissioner Ward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6057)|
| 1:40:58| I'm just doing what Gina's doing over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6058)|
| 1:41:00| You're just pushing the button.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6060)|
| 1:41:01| I'm just pushing buttons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6061)|
| 1:41:02| You're just pushing buttons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6062)|
| 1:41:03| So I figure she's doing it, and she's one of the cool kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6063)|
| 1:41:06| I can do it too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6066)|
| 1:41:08| That's all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6068)|
| 1:41:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6069)|
| 1:41:11| I'll push my button again and ask for new microphones.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6071)|
| 1:41:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6076)|
| 1:41:17| Commissioner Oster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6077)|
| 1:41:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6078)|
| 1:41:19| There's no resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6079)|
| 1:41:20| I'm just making an announcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6080)|
| 1:41:23| Rocky Top Bourbon Charity, who is really, really big with REES Across America...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6083)|
| 1:41:27| Hold on. Hold on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| Oh, sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6088)|
| 1:41:29| We're not done with business yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6089)|
| 1:41:30| You've got to finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6090)|
| 1:41:31| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6091)|
| 1:41:32| It's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6092)|
| 1:41:34| Just a little bit longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6094)|
| 1:41:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6100)|
| 1:41:41| As I mentioned to the chair and commissioner earlier,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6101)|
| 1:41:50| if the sense of this body...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6110)|
| 1:41:51| You don't need a resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6111)|
| 1:41:53| The sense of this body, which I picked up, is you want a letter to be written,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6113)|
| 1:41:57| to be that the clerk...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6117)|
| 1:41:59| I can give to the clerk, and the clerk can tell Lieutenant Lawson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6119)|
| 1:42:02| hand deliver this to a peer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6122)|
| 1:42:04| I'm more than willing to do that, and I'll get it done tomorrow morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6124)|
| 1:42:09| and get it to the clerk, and she can get Lieutenant Lawson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6129)|
| 1:42:14| I'm sure, would be very happy to handle it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6134)|
| 1:42:17| Just a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6137)|
| 1:42:18| I think as chair, Madam Chair, you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6138)|
| 1:42:21| And I'm seeing some head nods, so yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6141)|
| 1:42:24| We would appreciate it if you could do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6146)|
| 1:42:27| At the request of Commissioner Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6147)|
| 1:42:31| he would like to hear from the district commissioners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6151)|
| 1:42:34| if there's anything we need to know on our zonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6154)|
| 1:42:37| Obviously, we are not voting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6157)|
| 1:42:39| We are not discussing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6159)|
| 1:42:40| It is more of a drive-by this, don't drive by it, that sort of scenario.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6160)|
| 1:42:47| Can I just say...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6167)|
| 1:42:47| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6167)|
| 1:42:48| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6168)|
| 1:42:50| Items 50 through 54 are on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6170)|
| 1:42:55| So those items in Districts 8 and 9, if there's something we need to know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6175)|
| 1:43:00| but consent means nobody emailed, nobody showed up at the meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6180)|
| 1:43:04| no phone calls, no letters, no nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6184)|
| 1:43:07| So I guess my question is items 55, 56, and 57,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6187)|
| 1:43:11| which are in Commission Districts 8 and 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6191)|
| 1:43:15| if those commissioners have any information| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6195)|
| 1:43:18| that would be relevant before next Monday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6198)|
| 1:43:27| I'm skipping this side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6207)|
| 1:43:29| Commissioner Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6209)|
| 1:43:30| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6210)|
| 1:43:31| I will comment as the 8th District Commissioner,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6211)|
| 1:43:35| and forgive me there, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6215)|
| 1:43:37| I see your district is also listed on this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6217)|
| 1:43:39| because I think this used to be in your district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6219)|
| 1:43:40| It was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6220)|
| 1:43:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6221)|
| 1:43:41| And now it's yours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6221)|
| 1:43:42| Yeah, thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6222)|
| 1:43:43| You're welcome.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6223)|
| 1:43:47| I would simply point out this is the vacant field| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6227)|
| 1:43:51| across from the condos known as Joshua's Landing near Shannondale Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6231)|
| 1:43:57| I'll say two things about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6237)|
| 1:43:59| One is there is substantial concern from the community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6239)|
| 1:44:03| about the traffic on Tazewell Pike, especially at Shannondale Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6243)|
| 1:44:07| because of the school being nearby and so forth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6247)|
| 1:44:11| The other thing I would point out is that this property is already zoned RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6251)|
| 1:44:18| So it's complicated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6258)|
| 1:44:23| The request is to rezone to PR.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6263)|
| 1:44:27| I think the density would be the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6267)|
| 1:44:29| But it's already zoned RA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6269)|
| 1:44:32| So they put 10,000 square foot lots on it today by right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6272)|
| 1:44:41| And if I may add to it, since this was a property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6281)|
| 1:44:44| and I have lived here most of my life,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6284)|
| 1:44:46| this was a single family farm and it still even has horses on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6286)|
| 1:44:53| So and it is, Shannondale is a very congested road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| especially in the mornings and the afternoons for school pickup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6297)|
| 1:45:01| It is, I would avoid it at all costs during those times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6301)|
| 1:45:06| It is just a nightmare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| And to, yes, go look at it during those times, actually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6307)|
| 1:45:15| Play it for an hour and a half.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6315)|
| 1:45:18| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6320)|

| 1:45:26| requesting for RA, even though it was on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6326)|
| 1:45:31| Got a concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6331)|
| 1:45:31| It's only 21,480 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6331)|
| 1:45:34| That's less than a half an acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-ws-r-1467-221114?start=6334)|
