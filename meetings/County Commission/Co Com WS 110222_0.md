| 0:03:29| I read off those numbers, if anyone wants to take anything off that, please feel free to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=209)|

| 0:04:16| thirty-three, thirty-four, forty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=256)|
| 0:04:24| Does anyone wish to remove any of those from a consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=264)|
| 0:04:30| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=270)|
| 0:04:31| I'd like to remove number four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=271)|
| 0:04:33| Number four is removed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=273)|
| 0:04:36| Any other commissioner like to remove anything from the suggested consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| Yes, Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=281)|
| 0:04:44| Just, I know we can't really deal with it too carefully, I mean, intimately, but number eleven,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=284)|
| 0:04:52| I would just like to talk about that from a financial standpoint for a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=292)|
| 0:04:57| Sure, we'll take it off and discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=297)|
| 0:05:01| Anything else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=301)|
| 0:05:03| If not, do I hear a motion that those items listed go to consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=303)|
| 0:05:06| I make a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=306)|
| 0:05:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=307)|
| 0:05:08| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=308)|
| 0:05:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=309)|
| 0:05:10| Let me also mention this too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=310)|
| 0:05:13| Jolie, I want to make sure I'm correct on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=313)|
| 0:05:15| We're going to need to be out of this room at what time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=315)|
| 0:05:20| At what time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=320)|
| 0:05:22| Five o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=322)|
| 0:05:24| City Council meets tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| We do have a public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=325)|
| 0:05:26| And so what we're going to do is we will need to move to the room next door to continue with the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=326)|
| 0:05:32| My sense is that we're probably not going to be done by five o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=332)|
| 0:05:35| If we are, that's great, but we may not be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=335)|
| 0:05:37| So just so everyone knows that at that appointed time we're going to need to vacate this building to make room for City Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=337)|
| 0:05:43| I mean, yes, and then we'll move to the small assembly room next door to continue on with the public hearing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=343)|
| 0:05:48| Let's move on with the agenda now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=348)|
| 0:05:50| Clerk, first item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| On page one, item four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=351)|
| 0:05:54| Consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=354)|
| 0:05:57| amending the bylaws of the Three Ridges Golf Board to increase the membership to 16 voting members| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=357)|
| 0:06:03| and approving the reappointment of John Whitehead as the 16th voting member on the board, Resolution 110.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=363)|
| 0:06:09| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=369)|
| 0:06:12| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=372)|
| 0:06:13| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=373)|
| 0:06:16| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=376)|
| 0:06:17| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=377)|
| 0:06:18| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=378)|
| 0:06:19| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=379)|
| 0:06:21| This troubles me in that, you know, I guess I'll go back to the compelling reasons to having, one, a spread of board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=381)|
| 0:06:33| It looks like this one was 11 to 15.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=393)|
| 0:06:36| There's compelling reasons to have odd numbers of members on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=396)|
| 0:06:41| But there's also compelling reasons to have, you know, some turnover on the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=401)|
| 0:06:48| I just think this is a slippery slope that we're potentially going to get into.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=408)|
| 0:06:54| When it comes time for someone to go off, let's expand the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=414)|
| 0:06:59| Let's make it bigger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=419)|
| 0:07:00| Let's, you know, because we like him or her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=420)|
| 0:07:03| And I'm sure this person probably did a great job doing his, in this case, time on the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=423)|
| 0:07:09| but to set a rule that goes on in perpetuity that says we're going to add a member,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=429)|
| 0:07:18| what's going to happen when the next person, someone else, better or worse or whatever, gets this body approved?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=438)|
| 0:07:25| So I'm just really worried about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| And I guess I'll say I'll listen if anyone else has any other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=450)|
| 0:07:34| If not, I may make a different motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=454)|
| 0:07:37| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=457)|
| 0:07:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=458)|
| 0:07:39| And I completely understand what Mr. McKenzie is saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=459)|
| 0:07:43| And I think maybe I would suggest a deferral.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=463)|
| 0:07:49| And I'll take this back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=469)|
| 0:07:50| I'm just forwarding this from the board that I attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=470)|
| 0:07:55| And so I have, I thoroughly understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=475)|
| 0:07:59| So maybe the resolution would be let me take that back to the board, discuss it for a month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=479)|
| 0:08:04| and then we'll defer it to the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=484)|
| 0:08:06| So would you like to withdraw the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=486)|
| 0:08:09| I withdraw my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=489)|
| 0:08:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=491)|
| 0:08:12| There's a second withdrawal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=492)|
| 0:08:13| Agree to withdraw?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=493)|
| 0:08:14| Second agrees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=494)|
| 0:08:15| So it is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=495)|
| 0:08:16| Make a motion to defer to the next commission meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=496)|
| 0:08:18| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=498)|
| 0:08:19| I mean, do you want to withdraw it totally or do you want to defer it to the next commission meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=499)|
| 0:08:22| Oh, let's just defer to the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=502)|
| 0:08:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=505)|
| 0:08:26| So the motion now is to defer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=506)|
| 0:08:27| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=507)|
| 0:08:28| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=508)|
| 0:08:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=509)|
| 0:08:30| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=510)|
| 0:08:31| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=511)|
| 0:08:32| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=512)|
| 0:08:33| You had a light on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=513)|
| 0:08:34| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=514)|
| 0:08:35| Just a point of order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=515)|
| 0:08:36| And I don't know the answer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=516)|
| 0:08:37| How many terms has he already served?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=517)|
| 0:08:39| I have no idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=519)|
| 0:08:40| So there wasn't any discussion, really, of Mr. Whitehead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=520)|
| 0:08:43| The only prevailing reason for his reappointment was he was already serving as vice chair of the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=523)|
| 0:08:51| And so they had already assigned, you know, these committees and he was vice chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| And so everybody, you know, just to keep from undoing the structure that was already in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=537)|
| 0:09:04| that was the simplest suggestion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=544)|
| 0:09:06| But we'll go back, we'll discuss that, and we'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=546)|
| 0:09:09| We'll come back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=549)|
| 0:09:10| It doesn't matter to me, but, you know, we passed that you can't serve more than two terms, and I was just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=550)|
| 0:09:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=554)|
| 0:09:15| I think he's within his two terms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=556)|
| 0:09:17| So otherwise that wouldn't be a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=557)|
| 0:09:20| But I'll review that and get back to the commission with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=560)|
| 0:09:25| Well, I guess it will be two questions then for you, commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=565)|
| 0:09:30| How long he, I know that was a rule passed, but then also how long has he been on the board in total?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=570)|
| 0:09:40| Yeah, but I think there was a time where we passed that law and all terms prior to that don't count toward it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=580)|
| 0:09:48| So I'd just like to know how long has he been on Three Ridges Board in all since they've kind of redone things?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=588)|
| 0:09:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=595)|
| 0:09:56| So it's going to be deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| We vote it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=597)|
| 0:09:58| It's going to be deferred until the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=598)|
| 0:09:59| Clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| Page two, item five, consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| creating a committee to assist in the county commission redistricting process, resolution 111.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=607)|
| 0:10:14| Make a motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=614)|
| 0:10:15| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=615)|
| 0:10:17| The committee we had last time, you recall Greg McKay came to us in our work session| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=617)|
| 0:10:22| and suggested that we go ahead and appoint a committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=622)|
| 0:10:25| The last redistricting committee we had consisted of three commissioners, three members of the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=625)|
| 0:10:32| Mr. Rick Emmett served as chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=632)|
| 0:10:34| Mr. Emmett says that he is willing to serve again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=634)|
| 0:10:37| Probably not as chairman, but he is willing to serve again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| Feedback on this structure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=642)|
| 0:10:44| Do you like this structure of three commissioners plus three members from the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=644)|
| 0:10:47| We don't have to vote on these people today, but by Monday we can bring you some suggestions possibly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=647)|
| 0:10:53| Do you want to add more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=653)|
| 0:10:55| How do you want to form this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=655)|
| 0:10:57| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=657)|
| 0:10:58| What else is going to be considered?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=658)|
| 0:11:00| Are we going to be looking at just county commission redistricting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=660)|
| 0:11:03| Because I know also school board places are going to be redistricting, or do they do that separately?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=663)|
| 0:11:07| School board will do that separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=667)|
| 0:11:08| They have appointed their own committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=668)|
| 0:11:10| So this will just be county commission based on the new census data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=670)|
| 0:11:15| So is everyone okay with the three commissioners and three members of the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=675)|
| 0:11:20| That's what we had last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=680)|
| 0:11:23| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=683)|
| 0:11:24| Well, Tank was on there last time as the chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=684)|
| 0:11:26| Whoever is six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=686)|
| 0:11:29| We could have seven.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=689)|
| 0:11:30| Do we need an odd number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=690)|
| 0:11:32| I think we need an odd number, maybe three commissioners and four citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=692)|
| 0:11:36| Four citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=696)|
| 0:11:39| Okay, I'll operate under that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=699)|
| 0:11:41| I'll bring you some suggestions on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=701)|
| 0:11:43| Okay, clerk, next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=703)|
| 0:11:45| Oh, let me vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=705)|
| 0:11:46| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=706)|

| 0:11:51| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=711)|
| 0:11:52| Item number six, consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=712)|
| 0:11:57| confirming the Knox County mayor's appointment of, as a hearing officer for violations associated with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=717)|
| 0:12:02| ordinance regulating sexually oriented businesses within Knox County Resolution 112.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=722)|
| 0:12:06| Mr. Rice, do we have a name for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=726)|
| 0:12:15| Dean Rice, 806 Meadowfield Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=735)|
| 0:12:18| The mayor is in conversation with a couple of people on that position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=738)|
| 0:12:21| We want to identify the correct person with the right qualifications.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=741)|
| 0:12:24| So if you could defer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=744)|
| 0:12:26| You want to defer it a month or until the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=746)|
| 0:12:28| Just a month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=748)|
| 0:12:29| One month, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=749)|
| 0:12:30| Is there a motion to defer to the next meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=750)|
| 0:12:31| No move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=751)|

| 0:12:45| Does anyone have any suggestions for this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| I have a couple of people that I'm talking with as a suggestion, but unless someone else has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=767)|
| 0:12:52| I'll be able to bring a name to us on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=772)|
| 0:12:56| Does anyone else have anything?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=776)|
| 0:12:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=777)|
| 0:12:58| I'd like to ask that this be, oh, Commissioner Burrells?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| Yes, I would like to ask that we look for a qualified minority for this position.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=781)|
| 0:13:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=786)|
| 0:13:09| I will bring you a couple of names on Monday, so if we could just send this on without recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=789)|

| 0:13:18| It will be moved on to Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=799)|
| 0:13:24| On page three, item number 11, consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| approving a grant agreement in the amount of $200,000 for 20 years between the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=810)|
| 0:13:35| and Knox County Board of Education to assist in funding board's lease of the L&N Station Campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=815)|
| 0:13:40| for the operation of a STEM Academy High School Resolution 204.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=820)|
| 0:13:44| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=824)|
| 0:13:45| Motion to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=825)|
| 0:13:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=826)|
| 0:13:47| Discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=827)|
| 0:13:48| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=828)|
| 0:13:50| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=830)|
| 0:13:51| I was just wondering if, I think Mr. Oaks is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=831)|
| 0:13:55| Just wanted to ask a couple of questions from the school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=835)|
| 0:13:59| And this is just grapevine stuff in terms of federal budget cuts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=839)|
| 0:14:06| and the type of fiscal note that the county is responsible for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=846)|
| 0:14:13| If some of these scary cuts take place at the federal level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=853)|
| 0:14:19| are the funding mechanisms jeopardized as far as you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=859)|
| 0:14:25| And if they, you know, just are we vulnerable from a physical standpoint| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=865)|
| 0:14:32| if federal budget cuts go deep enough to go into some of these grants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=872)|
| 0:14:39| these large grants like we're receiving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=879)|
| 0:14:42| and we're really relying on for the construction and the implementation of the STEM Academy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=882)|
| 0:14:49| I'm just, you know, I'm just sort of wondering when I hear C-SPAN.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=889)|
| 0:14:54| Well, I can tell you I'm not completely fluent in how deep those cuts are going to go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| or what the discussion is around those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=899)|
| 0:15:01| But we do have race to the top funding associated with the STEM Academy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=901)|
| 0:15:07| which is what this grant supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=907)|
| 0:15:09| This grant in particular is not associated with federal funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=909)|
| 0:15:15| It is directly from the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=915)|
| 0:15:17| And to my understanding, it is an offset from the property tax that they would collect on this property over those 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=917)|
| 0:15:24| So we get that back to help us pay the lease on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=924)|
| 0:15:28| We do have a number of different formula grants that we receive from the federal government| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=928)|
| 0:15:35| in the form of the various title programs, Title I, Title II, and several others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=935)|
| 0:15:41| Don't know the impact on that yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=941)|
| 0:15:44| We're still getting preliminary information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=944)|
| 0:15:46| but we don't have anything that's firm at this point that would lead us to believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=946)|
| 0:15:53| that there would be a significant issue at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=953)|
| 0:15:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=957)|
| 0:15:58| Do you know anything about, as regards race to the top funding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=958)|
| 0:16:03| I don't know anything, and I've heard nothing about reduction of those funds that are coming to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=963)|
| 0:16:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=969)|
| 0:16:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=970)|
| 0:16:11| Mr. Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=971)|
| 0:16:12| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=972)|
| 0:16:14| Following on Commissioner Norman's questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=974)|
| 0:16:18| I'm just speaking now here in commission about a couple of things that I've noticed that's happened| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=978)|
| 0:16:24| just in the last couple of three weeks related to the STEM school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=984)|
| 0:16:28| It's just as Commissioner Norman is expressing concern about where's the money going to come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=988)|
| 0:16:35| At the last school board workshop or school board meeting one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=995)|
| 0:16:39| even the superintendent expressed concern about tax credits related to this particular renovation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=999)|
| 0:16:53| and then I've noticed in the last week or so the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1013)|
| 0:16:56| somehow we've come up now the designation of the property is different than it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1016)|
| 0:17:02| I would submit that a renovation to a historic property is going to cost more than the way the property sat before that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1022)|
| 0:17:10| But I'm just speaking of things that, as Commissioner Norman is suggesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1030)|
| 0:17:16| we just don't know what's before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1036)|
| 0:17:18| and us not having any input should make us feel a little apprehensive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1038)|
| 0:17:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1046)|
| 0:17:27| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1047)|
| 0:17:29| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1049)|
| 0:17:30| Just as a way of announcement, the school board had an open house with the principal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1050)|
| 0:17:36| So it was last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1056)|
| 0:17:37| There was a lot of excitement about that school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1057)|
| 0:17:41| There was a lot of excited parents, excited students looking at that property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1061)|
| 0:17:47| I kind of walked it with Mr. Dillingham, and there's a great plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1067)|
| 0:17:53| It looks like they're going to, you know, come in under budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1073)|
| 0:17:57| Now, under the extended budget, I'll admit that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1077)|
| 0:18:00| but it looks like the project looks like it's going to be on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1080)|
| 0:18:04| It's going to end up being a really nice facility for the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1084)|
| 0:18:09| So I just wanted to make that announcement in the way that I think they're well underway of having a great deal of success.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1089)|
| 0:18:17| We have a motion and a second on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1097)|
| 0:18:19| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1099)|
| 0:18:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1100)|
| 0:18:21| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1102)|

| 0:18:29| Consideration of a resolution of the commission of North County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1109)|

| 0:18:38| and St. Mary's Villa at Riverview II, Inc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1118)|
| 0:18:41| to clarify the definition of assisted living activities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1121)|
| 0:18:44| and waive all deposits of the shelter rent due prior to January 1, 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1124)|
| 0:18:49| which totaled $109,361 for all three facilities, Resolution 503.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1129)|
| 0:18:55| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1135)|
| 0:18:58| I'll make a motion to approve, but I do have a question for Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1138)|
| 0:19:01| Is there a motion for a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1141)|
| 0:19:04| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1144)|
| 0:19:05| There is a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1145)|
| 0:19:06| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1146)|
| 0:19:09| I just, from what I remember, I think we kind of gave you a few items to address as you all came back to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1149)|
| 0:19:17| So I don't know if you have those for us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1157)|
| 0:19:20| but I wouldn't mind just hearing your response to a few of our questions as to the logistics of why we're doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1160)|
| 0:19:29| Just to reintroduce myself, my name is Mary DeMoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1169)|
| 0:19:32| I work for Catholic Healthcare Partners based in Cincinnati, Ohio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1172)|
| 0:19:37| I also serve as the treasurer for these three housing properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1177)|
| 0:19:42| The background was that when these properties were initially built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1182)|
| 0:19:46| the pilot arrangements were signed and agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1186)|
| 0:19:49| As we centralized our management, we own in total 15 low-income elderly properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1189)|
| 0:19:55| As we centralized that management, we became aware of this agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1195)|
| 0:19:59| and started making those deposits in 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1199)|
| 0:20:02| and making sure that HUD provided us adequate rents to make those deposits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1202)|
| 0:20:07| and have continued to try to work with the commission and other folks in the county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1207)|
| 0:20:12| to bring a resolution to this issue since we discovered it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1212)|
| 0:20:17| What we discovered as we tried to work through this is we did need greater clarity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1217)|
| 0:20:22| around what those funds were supposed to be used for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1222)|
| 0:20:26| No one could provide a clear definition of assisted living activities for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1226)|
| 0:20:33| Also, obviously, some resolution needs to happen for the prior amounts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1233)|
| 0:20:39| What we have discovered as we continue to look for information related to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1239)|
| 0:20:45| is that we have been providing social worker services to the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1245)|
| 0:20:50| in these facilities as needed beginning in 2005.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1250)|
| 0:20:55| So from that perspective, we have been living up to the intent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1255)|
| 0:20:58| although maybe the mechanics weren't working the way they should have originally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| Also, we have clarified with HUD, and they have given us a written response,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1264)|
| 0:21:08| that they will not include any shortfall from previous deposits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1268)|
| 0:21:13| in their rent-setting process going forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1273)|
| 0:21:16| So we don't have another source of funding for the properties through HUD| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1276)|
| 0:21:21| to try to make up the difference in those balances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1281)|
| 0:21:27| You know, I still have some concern with granting this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1287)|
| 0:21:32| And, you know, there are several things that's come before us where, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1292)|
| 0:21:38| it's a situation where your heart goes out and you understand things weren't, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1298)|
| 0:21:43| not every I dotted and T crossed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1303)|
| 0:21:47| But this was a payment in lieu of taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1307)|
| 0:21:50| This was a kind of a set-aside special deal given these folks for good reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1310)|
| 0:22:02| And I think that was roughly understood at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1322)|
| 0:22:06| And then to kind of come back and say, no, well, we want a break on this special deal, I have issues with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1326)|
| 0:22:15| You know, and I'm just looking at a letter that our law director gave us concerning the New Covenant Church folk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1335)|
| 0:22:22| that came here, I think Commissioner Andrews' district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1342)|
| 0:22:25| Bad situation, but, you know, per the agreement, they're kind of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1345)|
| 0:22:31| obligated as best it stands right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1351)|
| 0:22:34| So, you know, I'm looking at this as a similar deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1354)|
| 0:22:39| You know, I think these monies owe the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1359)|
| 0:22:41| This is not money going into our pockets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| I think it's going for some type of, and you may want to correct me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1366)|
| 0:22:49| some kind of program to kind of perpetuate this assistance that we're giving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1369)|
| 0:22:56| So it's not like, you know, we're pocketing the money and paying off school debt or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1376)|
| 0:23:01| This is kind of a self-enclosed cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1381)|
| 0:23:04| And I just have issues with us giving a break or forbearance in this situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1384)|
| 0:23:16| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1396)|
| 0:23:19| I think I probably need to recuse myself from this just because of my relationship with CHP and Mercy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1399)|
| 0:23:26| Commissioner Andrews.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| Thank you, Grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1408)|
| 0:23:30| How much money, when was the pilot signed, the pilot agreement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1410)|
| 0:23:35| What year was it signed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1415)|
| 0:23:38| Well, there were three different agreements, and I think they were signed at different years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1418)|
| 0:23:42| But the agreements may have been signed at a certain period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1422)|
| 0:23:45| but the time, the collection time would have been different than the actual time the agreement was signed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1425)|
| 0:23:51| obviously because the developments had to be finished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1431)|
| 0:23:54| How much money are they asking us to defer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1434)|
| 0:23:57| Was it just the $109,000?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1437)|
| 0:23:59| Among the three properties, it's a little over $109,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1439)|
| 0:24:03| And these are dollars that they were supposed to have set aside for themselves to put back into the properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1443)|
| 0:24:09| for assisted living activities, which we had some questions as to what that was defined as.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1449)|
| 0:24:16| And we've cleared that up with HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1456)|
| 0:24:18| The addendums before you are satisfactory to our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1458)|
| 0:24:23| Are they satisfactory to HUD?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| Yes, they're satisfactory to HUD.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| Talked to the law director's office about it as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1468)|
| 0:24:31| It's just one of those issues that Catholic Health Partners discovered when they acquired the properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1471)|
| 0:24:37| Our office had no rec – we had no knowledge of this agreement at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1477)|
| 0:24:41| I don't know – this agreement didn't live anywhere when it was entered into between the county and St. Mary's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1481)|
| 0:24:48| The agreement took place, and then we don't know where that contract went.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1488)|
| 0:24:51| It wasn't in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1491)|
| 0:24:52| So from here on out, these contracts, these agreements will live in our office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1492)|
| 0:24:57| We'll follow up on them each year, make sure that the monies are being set aside and being spent in the proper way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1497)|
| 0:25:05| From what I gather, this is – you know, the new covenant – this and the new covenant are kind of apples and oranges| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1505)|
| 0:25:12| because this was a failure on the county's part in previous years of making them follow through on their pilot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1512)|
| 0:25:21| And the new owner on the new covenant, you know, the county had no liability because it was a state taxation issue, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1521)|
| 0:25:28| And as unfortunate as both of them are, I think that they came to us to try to rectify the situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1528)|
| 0:25:37| And to me, as long as we have fixed our issues, although we wouldn't have got this $109,000 anyway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1537)|
| 0:25:48| it's their facility and their services that suffered for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1548)|
| 0:25:51| Yeah, and if I may, they're also stating that there was a period of time of three years, or if not more,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1551)|
| 0:25:58| where they were providing client services at these developments without, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1558)|
| 0:26:05| using the HUD shelter rents or any of the set aside from the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1565)|
| 0:26:12| So they're kind of asking for some credit for that, even though it didn't go through the proper channels| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1572)|
| 0:26:16| where they were to set aside those shelter rents and then put those dollars towards those activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| So if we did a, what you're saying, if we did a firm audit of that, they may be on the negative instead of on the positive?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1580)|
| 0:26:26| I think the numbers were a little bit less, but it's close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1586)|
| 0:26:29| And, you know, I think they're asking for some credit for that, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1589)|
| 0:26:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1593)|
| 0:26:34| What's the motion on the floor to approve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1594)|
| 0:26:35| Motion is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1597)|
| 0:26:38| Any other discussion? Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1598)|
| 0:26:40| You know, just as an example, if, and I understand what Commissioner Andrews is saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1600)|
| 0:26:48| but in the case of if KUB in error never came by for a year and read your meter and that error was realized,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1608)|
| 0:26:59| there's a law on the books that says they have to go back and collect those funds, even though it was their mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1619)|
| 0:27:09| And I don't know what these numbers look like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1629)|
| 0:27:11| Their clients were promised some things based on this agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1631)|
| 0:27:16| And, you know, I'd actually be okay if they could give a, you know, line by line saying we paid over and above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1636)|
| 0:27:23| or we paid $109,000 or we paid $50,000 and we'll pay the other $60,000 in cash.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1643)|
| 0:27:29| I mean, to me, if you had some evidence, I don't mind doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1649)|
| 0:27:34| But just to say, okay, you all did some things that we're not going to have a firm audit on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1654)|
| 0:27:40| or if we have had a firm audit on, we know that you're still a little in a deficit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1660)|
| 0:27:45| And then come back and say, well, we'll just call it even.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1665)|
| 0:27:48| That's just, that's not the way business works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1668)|
| 0:27:52| It shouldn't be the way government works.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1672)|
| 0:27:54| You know, I think if there's agreements out there, these agreements, again, benefited our citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1674)|
| 0:28:02| Again, it's not like we're robbing Peter to pay Paul.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1682)|
| 0:28:05| They were going to benefit the seniors that were associated with this facility, not county citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1685)|
| 0:28:10| And I just think that, you know, if I have a bill that's due, even though I didn't realize it, I need to pay it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1690)|
| 0:28:22| Mr. Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1703)|
| 0:28:25| You mentioned that during this three-year period here, whatever period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1705)|
| 0:28:28| that there was considerable services provided to some of these folks that, in effect, we didn't pay for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1708)|
| 0:28:39| Do you have any idea, dollar-wise, about what that would amount to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1719)|
| 0:28:45| The estimates I've been given are between $70,000 and $75,000 worth of services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1725)|
| 0:28:50| social worker services, to help coordinate any assistance that those residents needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1730)|
| 0:28:56| Well, in effect, you could have submitted a bill for that for us to pay in one sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1736)|
| 0:29:02| Well, to come out of the shelter rent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1742)|
| 0:29:04| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| So it's really not $109,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1745)|
| 0:29:08| We're talking now somewhere around $30,000 to just clear the books.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1748)|
| 0:29:14| So I don't really have a problem with it myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1754)|
| 0:29:18| Any other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1758)|
| 0:29:19| The motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1759)|
| 0:29:20| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1760)|
| 0:29:22| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1762)|
| 0:29:23| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1763)|
| 0:29:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1764)|
| 0:29:25| One recusal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1765)|
| 0:29:26| Commissioner Briggs, Commissioner Burroughs and McKenzie voted no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1766)|
| 0:29:29| Anyone else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1769)|
| 0:29:32| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1772)|
| 0:29:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1773)|
| 0:29:34| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1774)|
| 0:29:41| On page five, item number 24, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1781)|
| 0:29:48| approving the fiscal year 2011 through 2012 in Knox County indigent care program agreement in the amount of $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1788)|
| 0:29:54| This is resolution 604.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1794)|
| 0:29:56| Dr. Buchanan, if you want to come on down, is there a motion on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1796)|
| 0:30:00| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1800)|
| 0:30:01| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1801)|
| 0:30:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1802)|
| 0:30:03| Motion has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1803)|
| 0:30:05| Dr. Buchanan, is this an increase?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1805)|
| 0:30:07| I think I've seen $5 million for the last two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1807)|
| 0:30:11| For the record, Martha Buchanan, 140 Damron Avenue, Director of the Health Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1811)|
| 0:30:15| Actually, this is a decrease, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| This is a decrease of $250,000 on this contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1817)|
| 0:30:22| It was a $5.25 million contract and has decreased to $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1822)|
| 0:30:27| In looking at the budget and also thinking forward about the changes that we anticipate may happen with health care| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1827)|
| 0:30:35| as health care reform takes whatever form it takes and the need for this program eventually changing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1835)|
| 0:30:42| or hopefully decreasing, actually, would be lovely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1842)|
| 0:30:45| We're beginning that process now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1845)|
| 0:30:47| I've spoken with all the CEOs of the hospitals and they're still on board| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1847)|
| 0:30:50| and plan to participate with this program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1850)|
| 0:30:54| Any questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1854)|
| 0:30:56| The motion is so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1856)|
| 0:30:58| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1858)|
| 0:30:59| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1859)|
| 0:31:00| Dr. Buchanan, just quickly, is the $5 million, is that $5 million in pure Knox County taxpayer money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1860)|
| 0:31:06| or is that a hodgepodge of state and federal dollars or can you identify it that way?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1866)|
| 0:31:11| That is $5 million of pure Knox County health department or Knox County money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1871)|
| 0:31:16| Just out of the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1876)|
| 0:31:17| Out of the general fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1877)|
| 0:31:18| And that is used to provide for primary care services, hospitalizations and specialty care services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1878)|
| 0:31:25| for those folks who meet the income guidelines and live in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1885)|
| 0:31:30| So it's only serving Knox County residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| People who live outside the county do not qualify for the program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1892)|
| 0:31:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1896)|
| 0:31:37| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1897)|
| 0:31:38| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1898)|
| 0:31:39| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1899)|
| 0:31:40| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1900)|
| 0:31:42| Motion passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1902)|
| 0:31:43| Dr. Buchanan, if you would just stay there, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1903)|
| 0:31:45| Our next item, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| Item number 25, consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1906)|
| 0:31:50| approving a contract in the amount of $1,595,000 for Cherokee health system for indigent primary care services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1910)|
| 0:31:56| for adult enrollees in the Knox County indigent care program, resolution 605.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1916)|
| 0:32:01| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1921)|
| 0:32:03| I'll move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1923)|
| 0:32:04| And a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1924)|
| 0:32:05| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1925)|
| 0:32:07| Dr. Buchanan, have we had any issues since they've taken over this program?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1927)|
| 0:32:13| I know that there was some concern when Cherokee health took this over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1933)|
| 0:32:16| Have we had any issues, any problems?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| Actually, there have been issues that have been resolved, working our staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| and Cherokee staff working closely together to solve those issues to help ensure that these adults get services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1946)|
| 0:32:34| as quickly as they can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1954)|
| 0:32:36| And they've kind of tiered the system and worked out those kinks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1956)|
| 0:32:38| We had the same problems when we had the program, getting folks in, as you can imagine,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1958)|
| 0:32:42| folks who don't have insurance sometimes wait to be seen and sometimes come in in dire need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1962)|
| 0:32:47| So we're trying to meet those needs very quickly now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| and folks are being served well on this program just kind of working with Cherokee and our staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1970)|
| 0:32:57| And how does this money compare to last year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1977)|
| 0:33:00| Again, this is part of that $5 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1980)|
| 0:33:03| So it is reduced by $65,000 based on that $250,000 cut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1983)|
| 0:33:08| We just took the $250,000 out, and Cherokee will get $65,000 less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1988)|
| 0:33:15| There's actually a correction that I need to make, and I'm not sure how to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1995)|
| 0:33:19| But they've also asked, if you look at the contract, the ceiling for enrollment is 100, sorry, 1,392.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=1999)|
| 0:33:29| They've asked to drop that to 1,250.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2009)|
| 0:33:33| We have not been over the 1,000 enrolling mark for this program in over nine months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2013)|
| 0:33:39| So, again, folks will continue to get services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2019)|
| 0:33:42| It won't be a reduction in services to the citizens, just a change in that cap to go with that $65,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2022)|
| 0:33:48| That was something I got late last week from Cherokee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2028)|
| 0:33:50| So I apologize for that late information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2030)|
| 0:33:53| Commissioner Burroughs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2033)|
| 0:33:56| If I'm not mistaken, this is where the homeless get their health care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2036)|
| 0:34:03| And so this is one of the criticisms that I often hear about Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2043)|
| 0:34:08| is that we don't do our share when it comes to supporting homeless services, and we do right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2048)|
| 0:34:19| We pay a lot of money every year for health care for our homeless citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2059)|
| 0:34:25| I'd also like to point out that when we are talking about things like the safety center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2065)|
| 0:34:29| and permanent supportive housing, and we talk about savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2069)|
| 0:34:33| this is exactly where we're going to be seeing savings, one of the places,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2073)|
| 0:34:36| because when someone goes through the safety center or has a case manager,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2076)|
| 0:34:44| they avoid emergency room treatment, which is what runs these bills up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2084)|
| 0:34:50| So, you know, if we invested less than half of this amount in building the safety center,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2090)|
| 0:34:58| we could get a payoff probably within five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2098)|
| 0:35:02| So just when we are talking about those issues, they aren't abstract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2102)|
| 0:35:06| They're all tied together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2106)|
| 0:35:08| And this is what this money is going for, and we know how we can save it if we're willing to do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2108)|
| 0:35:16| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2116)|
| 0:35:18| Yes, I just wanted to make a clarification maybe on what Commissioner Hammond said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2118)|
| 0:35:23| This program has been around for a long time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2123)|
| 0:35:25| We've had this contract with Cherokee, this adult program, not the children's program, which was different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2125)|
| 0:35:30| Yes, this program was transitioned over to Cherokee in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2130)|
| 0:35:35| April 2006 is when they assumed providing primary care to adults,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2135)|
| 0:35:39| which is different than the pediatric transition that we just underwent with them as well, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2139)|
| 0:35:43| And the second clarification is that when the people that are either homeless| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| or whether they're even enrolled in the Cherokee system and they need specialty care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2148)|
| 0:35:54| that is not covered under these funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2154)|
| 0:35:57| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2157)|
| 0:35:59| That's covered under the rest of the five million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2159)|
| 0:36:02| That's what I mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2162)|
| 0:36:03| Yes, it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2163)|
| 0:36:04| That is not part of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2164)|
| 0:36:05| This particular piece covers being seen by the Cherokee providers in their facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2165)|
| 0:36:12| regular office x-rays, regular office labs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2172)|
| 0:36:15| And the really huge piece that saves us a lot of money is the pharmacy,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2175)|
| 0:36:19| because Cherokee has the ability to purchase drugs on what's called the 340B program,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2179)|
| 0:36:25| which we do not qualify for and would not qualify for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2185)|
| 0:36:29| So that dropped our drug cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2189)|
| 0:36:31| It was four times higher when we had it, so it dropped it by a fourth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2191)|
| 0:36:35| Pretty significant savings for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2195)|
| 0:36:37| Allows these folks access to the medications they need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2197)|
| 0:36:39| Keeps them out of the ER, we hope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2199)|
| 0:36:41| That's our plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2201)|
| 0:36:43| And I want to just reemphasize also what you said about the benefits from the drug program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| If you really look at what the costs were, what got the state into trouble on TennCare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2208)|
| 0:36:54| where they had to disenroll well over 100,000 families, it's drugs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2214)|
| 0:36:59| because one prescription can cost three or four or five times what a doctor's office visit costs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2219)|
| 0:37:08| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2228)|
| 0:37:10| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2230)|
| 0:37:11| Dr. Buchanan, I just ‑‑ this is a little bit off the subject,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2231)|
| 0:37:14| but when I think of Cherokee health systems,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2234)|
| 0:37:17| I'm somewhat confused about what their services are, their range of services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2237)|
| 0:37:21| And I always thought it was in the mental health field, but it's truly complete primary care, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2241)|
| 0:37:28| And I guess that's something that the commission would benefit from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2248)|
| 0:37:33| if we had a little more thorough understanding of what they do and how they do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2253)|
| 0:37:40| And I don't know whether that's part of their, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2260)|
| 0:37:43| that's something that they want, they feel like they need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2263)|
| 0:37:46| But just personally, from my standpoint, I think that would be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2266)|
| 0:37:50| I can get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2270)|
| 0:37:52| They have that information available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2272)|
| 0:37:55| Cherokee has a model where they provide primary care,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| to adults and children both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2279)|
| 0:38:02| But they also provide the psychiatric care that you're thinking of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2282)|
| 0:38:05| So it's a coordinated care.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2285)|
| 0:38:08| Their care teams, the medical teams and the psychiatric teams,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2288)|
| 0:38:11| meet together to try to address health issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2291)|
| 0:38:15| They addressed, I mean, they realized a long time ago that your psychiatric health impacts your medical health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2295)|
| 0:38:20| and vice versa, so they try to address the whole package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2300)|
| 0:38:23| So I can get that information for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2303)|
| 0:38:26| I'm happy to provide it for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2306)|
| 0:38:28| Commissioner Royals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2308)|
| 0:38:30| I just wanted to say in relation to what Tony had to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2310)|
| 0:38:35| was that after the shooting at our church two years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2315)|
| 0:38:41| Cherokee mental health professionals were very, very helpful to a lot of the members of our congregation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2321)|
| 0:38:48| and that's something that we really appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2328)|
| 0:38:51| They are good community members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2331)|
| 0:38:55| Any other questions, suggestions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| The motion on the floor is to approve, all those in favor, with one amendment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2337)|
| 0:39:01| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2341)|
| 0:39:03| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2343)|
| 0:39:04| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2344)|
| 0:39:05| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2345)|
| 0:39:06| Thank you, Doctor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2346)|
| 0:39:07| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2347)|
| 0:39:10| On page six, item number 29,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2350)|
| 0:39:13| consideration of a resolution of the commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2353)|
| 0:39:16| requesting the public billing authority of the county of Knox and city of Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2356)|
| 0:39:20| to approve and authorize certain energy conservation services| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2360)|
| 0:39:23| and installations for the city county building to be provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2363)|

| 0:39:34| and Knox County to effectuate this said work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2374)|
| 0:39:37| Resolution 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2377)|
| 0:39:38| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2378)|

| 0:39:43| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2383)|
| 0:39:45| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2385)|
| 0:39:46| There is a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2386)|
| 0:39:47| Questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| Mr. Troyer, if you would explain the scope of this, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2391)|
| 0:39:55| This is the same agreement that we've been talking about for a couple of months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2395)|
| 0:39:59| It involves Knox County, the city of Knoxville, and PBA to enter into a tri-party agreement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2399)|
| 0:40:05| so we've had to get all three legal departments to work together on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2405)|
| 0:40:09| which we all agreed to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2409)|
| 0:40:11| and to do a million round numbers, a million seven, in energy improvements to this facility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2411)|
| 0:40:17| and that would be funded through savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2417)|
| 0:40:19| The financing mechanism would be the city would advance the funds to the PBA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2419)|
| 0:40:25| The PBA would coordinate the work through the city's energy management provider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2425)|
| 0:40:31| The city has a contract with that, and we would reap the savings 68%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2431)|
| 0:40:36| The city would reap 32%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2436)|
| 0:40:40| What's the initial dollar amount?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2440)|
| 0:40:42| It's $1,699,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2442)|
| 0:40:44| What are we investing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2444)|
| 0:40:46| Our piece is $1,155,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2446)|
| 0:40:49| And then over the course of 13 years, our savings would be $2,200,000,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2449)|
| 0:40:53| so we have a net savings of $1,100,000 by doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2453)|
| 0:40:58| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2458)|
| 0:40:59| All those in favor say, oh, pardon me, Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2459)|
| 0:41:02| Well, our savings, so there's more than $2 million worth of savings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2462)|
| 0:41:05| but our bang for the buck is we're going to spend 1.1 and get 2 back, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2465)|
| 0:41:13| Yeah, that's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2473)|
| 0:41:14| Okay, so that's the 68% is the difference between that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2474)|
| 0:41:18| And then I didn't catch the time, seven?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2478)|
| 0:41:22| Yeah, it's a 6.6 payback, and we'd love to have better, but we think with the full cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2482)|
| 0:41:29| I think we've included everything that could be a cost,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2489)|
| 0:41:32| and that makes our payback a little longer than we'd like,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2492)|
| 0:41:35| but it's still we do this and we achieve savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2495)|
| 0:41:40| Motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2500)|
| 0:41:41| Oh, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2501)|
| 0:41:42| What are they going to change?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2502)|
| 0:41:45| Lighting, lighting controls, utility controls, and hot water variable frequency drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2505)|
| 0:41:51| What are they going to do to the lighting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2511)|
| 0:41:54| Probably, I mean, just I'm speaking out of turn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2514)|
| 0:41:56| but probably different type of fluorescent bulbs, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2516)|
| 0:41:59| or a third sometime in terms of the energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| And what the city has done at our facility is motion lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2521)|
| 0:42:07| The rooms are all motioned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2527)|
| 0:42:08| If there's nobody in the room, there's no sound in the room, the lights go out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2528)|
| 0:42:11| When the judge entered the room, everybody stands and the lights come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2531)|
| 0:42:17| Yes, and this is with the city's contractor, so it's going to be a similar set of improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| Motion on the floor is to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2545)|
| 0:42:26| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2546)|
| 0:42:27| Any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| It is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| Mr. Troyer, 802, that is withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2549)|
| 0:42:32| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| And we're going with 801.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2553)|
| 0:42:34| I just want to make sure I understood that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2554)|
| 0:42:37| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2557)|
| 0:42:38| 802 is incorporated into 801, and 802 is not necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2558)|
| 0:42:44| Ms. Lauderdale, are we going to take any action on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2564)|
| 0:42:46| or did we do it when we say everything that needs to be withdrawn is withdrawn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2566)|
| 0:42:49| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2569)|
| 0:42:50| That will be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2570)|
| 0:42:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2571)|
| 0:42:52| Next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2572)|
| 0:42:53| Item 32, consideration of a resolution of the Commission of Knox County, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2573)|
| 0:42:58| to the Economic Impact Plan for North Shore Town Center Economic Development Area, Resolution 901.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2578)|
| 0:43:04| Is there a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2584)|
| 0:43:05| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2585)|
| 0:43:06| And is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2586)|
| 0:43:08| Second for discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2588)|
| 0:43:11| Anyone here from IDB that would like to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2591)|
| 0:43:13| Mr. Napier, your name and address to the record, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2593)|
| 0:43:17| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| It's Todd Napier, 17 Market Square, number 201.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2598)|
| 0:43:21| I'm here today not as a development corporation employee, but as under contract to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2601)|
| 0:43:27| We are staffed to the county IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| What you have before you today is a resolution to approve an amended economic impact plan for the North Shore Town Center project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2610)|
| 0:43:37| The county IDB approved this at its last meeting, which is earlier this month,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2617)|
| 0:43:42| and sent it on to county commission and city council for your respective approvals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2622)|
| 0:43:48| Many of you may be aware this was a project that started about 2006, 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2628)|
| 0:43:54| The developers were Knox, Vest, LLC, which was an affiliate of the Durand Company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2634)|
| 0:44:01| I guess just a lot of different circumstances and the project kind of fell into a state of not being able to be completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2641)|
| 0:44:09| Just this past year, a new group of investors came along, bought out basically the note.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2649)|
| 0:44:16| The new group of investors is called North Shore Market Investors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2656)|
| 0:44:20| And their plan, and they're here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2660)|
| 0:44:23| and I'm going to let them do most of the talking if you've got questions about the project itself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2663)|
| 0:44:27| is basically to complete the plan with some minor, well, with some changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2667)|
| 0:44:34| The most significant of those has to do with the financing component of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2674)|
| 0:44:37| It's still requesting a $9 million worth of TIF borrowing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2677)|
| 0:44:42| but it would be more along the lines of traditional TIF where they borrow the amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2682)|
| 0:44:47| and then as the increment comes in, then they repay the principal and interest with the TIF financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2687)|
| 0:44:54| Some of the components that would be used that were discussed before the IDB for TIF financing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2694)|
| 0:45:01| would be North Shore Drive and public road improvements within the plan area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2701)|
| 0:45:05| slip ramp and other access from I-40 into the plan area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2705)|
| 0:45:09| And the plan area is basically the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2709)|
| 0:45:12| Improvements to the existing interchange between Pellissippi Parkway and North Shore Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2712)|
| 0:45:17| and the construction of some residential amenities within the plan area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2717)|
| 0:45:21| More specifically, there's some trails and some boardwalk area along the small lake there on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2721)|
| 0:45:28| So, as I mentioned before, allow up to $9 million of borrowing to pay for the specific improvements I mentioned earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2728)|
| 0:45:35| Six million of those would be from county's increments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2735)|
| 0:45:38| Nine million, excuse me, three million from the city's increment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2738)|
| 0:45:43| If the economic impact plan is approved by county commission and city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2743)|
| 0:45:49| then this group would come back to the IDB and enter into a development and financing agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2749)|
| 0:45:55| that would have all the very specifics about those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2755)|
| 0:45:58| So what you have before you today is the economic impact plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2758)|
| 0:46:03| And I can answer any questions related to, you know, kind of the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2763)|
| 0:46:08| But if you've got questions about the project, I know at least two of the partners and maybe more are here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2768)|
| 0:46:15| Commissioner Anders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2775)|
| 0:46:16| Hey, Todd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2776)|
| 0:46:19| You had me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| I was okay with it until you started talking about residential amenities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2780)|
| 0:46:23| What amenities are we going to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2783)|
| 0:46:24| Recreational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2784)|
| 0:46:26| Recreational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2786)|
| 0:46:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2787)|
| 0:46:30| What's the design?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2790)|
| 0:46:31| Is it going to be open to the public?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2791)|
| 0:46:32| Because I'm okay with them improving, having a slip ramp from 140 to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2792)|
| 0:46:39| I'm okay with them improving North Shore and Pellissippi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2799)|
| 0:46:42| And I'm okay with them improving North Shore at the interchange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2802)|
| 0:46:45| But I'm not okay with helping their residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2805)|
| 0:46:49| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2809)|
| 0:46:50| And let me just say, I'll let them answer that specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2810)|
| 0:46:52| But there were some recreational facilities that were open to the general public as part of the previous plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2812)|
| 0:46:57| And many of those components are still in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| But I'll let them elaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2819)|
| 0:47:05| Yes, I'm Jim Harrison, 5731 Lyons View Pike, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2825)|
| 0:47:11| Most of these improvements are park areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2831)|
| 0:47:14| We are looking at an amphitheater that will be formed around the lake there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2834)|
| 0:47:18| We have green belts that we will be developing around the neighborhoods and into the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2838)|
| 0:47:23| We also have a 10-foot sidewalk that will go along North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2843)|
| 0:47:29| And also as it comes to that lake where we will be widening the lake and making that more of a four-lane where it narrows down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2849)|
| 0:47:37| there will be a boardwalk that will go across there instead of widening more into the lake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2857)|
| 0:47:42| And there will be a boardwalk around the lake as well that will be pedestrian friendly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2862)|
| 0:47:45| Really nothing as far as directed directly to residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2865)|
| 0:47:48| Well, you have public parking and public restrooms there at that place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2868)|
| 0:47:52| Or is it just going to be for the people that live in the town center or around it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| Well, I mean, most of the development will have restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| There will be restaurants that we see around the lakes, retail shops that will have restrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2881)|
| 0:48:06| We have not planned on any public restrooms there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2886)|
| 0:48:08| Well, I mean, public parking for the residents?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2888)|
| 0:48:10| Public parking, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2890)|
| 0:48:11| Because what we're getting to is we're getting to amenities for your residents on the taxpayer dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2891)|
| 0:48:15| And what I want to do is make sure that we're doing amenities for the public on the taxpayer dime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2895)|
| 0:48:20| Well, there will be public parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2900)|
| 0:48:21| All the parking will be open parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2901)|
| 0:48:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2903)|
| 0:48:24| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2904)|
| 0:48:25| Mr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2905)|
| 0:48:26| Yes, Todd, I had a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| Did the original developers of this, did they have any TIFs or any special advantages?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2910)|
| 0:48:39| Help me elaborate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2919)|
| 0:48:40| Did the original developers have a TIF or did they have any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2920)|
| 0:48:44| Yes, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| This is a, there was a TIF already in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2925)|
| 0:48:47| And this is an amendment to that economic impact plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2927)|
| 0:48:50| What was the size of the original TIF that was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2930)|
| 0:48:55| It's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2935)|
| 0:48:56| Same terms as what was approved in 06.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2940)|
| 0:49:01| You know, I think this came up before when we were having a discussion is if a TIF is approved for a particular property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2941)|
| 0:49:06| and I guess this answers it today, is that transferable when someone else buys the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2946)|
| 0:49:12| What we're really doing is just transferring the TIF now from the developer that was not successful out there to one that wants to develop it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2952)|
| 0:49:19| Is that what we're really doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2959)|
| 0:49:20| Well, I will try to answer this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2960)|
| 0:49:22| That same question was asked of the IDB's attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2962)|
| 0:49:26| The TIF, the economic impact plan itself is really not tied to a specific developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2966)|
| 0:49:31| although it mentions one in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2971)|
| 0:49:35| The difference is and the reason is the economic impact plan is coming back before this body has to do with the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2975)|
| 0:49:41| and came back for the ID had to do with the financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2981)|
| 0:49:44| It originally, the developers were set up to basically self-finance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2984)|
| 0:49:50| and then just repay themselves versus your traditional where you go out and you borrow the money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2990)|
| 0:49:54| and you repay principal and interest with the increment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2994)|
| 0:49:57| So, I mean, that's my basic understanding from our attorney| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=2997)|
| 0:50:01| and hearing from their bond counsel on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3001)|
| 0:50:04| The development and financing agreement, which will come next,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| though is specifically related to and ties the development team back to some obligations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3007)|
| 0:50:15| And that's an agreement between the IDB and the developers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| And I think in the past in the county and in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3020)|
| 0:50:23| most of the TIFs that we've had have been for, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3023)|
| 0:50:27| the properties that were really dilapidated and they would not be developed but for the TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3027)|
| 0:50:33| And, you know, this came out in halls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3033)|
| 0:50:35| There was a question, I don't think it ever actually came before the commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3035)|
| 0:50:39| but using a TIF out there to develop one of the big box developments for a hardware store or something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3039)|
| 0:50:45| Do we have any other TIFs out in the county that aren't dealing with downtown dilapidated properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3045)|
| 0:50:53| There's been only two TIFs that have been done by the county IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3053)|
| 0:50:57| Most of those that you've spoken to have been done through KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3057)|
| 0:51:02| I think there's been one through the city IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3062)|
| 0:51:04| But specifically there was one that was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3064)|
| 0:51:07| It's called South Grove out at John Sevier Highway and Chapman Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3067)|
| 0:51:11| And then this was the only other one that was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3071)|
| 0:51:15| And I know there was a lot of discussion going on a couple of years ago, really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3075)|
| 0:51:19| about how these TIFs should be used and there was, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3079)|
| 0:51:24| variance of opinion as to whether we should be using those just as a tool for general economic development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3084)|
| 0:51:30| or just be using them as a tool to take deteriorated buildings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3090)|
| 0:51:36| or neighborhoods or areas to use that as an incentive to develop those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3096)|
| 0:51:40| Has there been any change, you know, on the part of the staff at the IDB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3100)|
| 0:51:46| on how we're going to use those and not to belabor a point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3106)|
| 0:51:53| but are we going down a road where anytime anyone wants to build anything anywhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3113)|
| 0:52:00| that they're going to become in looking for these?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3120)|
| 0:52:02| No, I think those points are very well, you know, are good points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3122)|
| 0:52:08| There was two TIFs that came along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3128)|
| 0:52:10| There was the first one I mentioned at South Grove and then there was this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3130)|
| 0:52:14| They were both passed by, well, this one in particular was passed by City Council, County Commission and the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3134)|
| 0:52:22| Then after that point, the IDB developed a set of policies and procedures for dealing with new TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3142)|
| 0:52:27| And it kind of gets more to those points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3147)|
| 0:52:29| Or, you know, is it an economic development issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3149)|
| 0:52:32| Is it a blight or is there severe public need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3152)|
| 0:52:37| This one here is a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3157)|
| 0:52:39| You know, there's only two that were done before those policies and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3159)|
| 0:52:42| And with the County IDB, you know, based on my observations of what they said was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3162)|
| 0:52:47| look, you know, are we being asked to do something within the law?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3167)|
| 0:52:51| Certainly this is within law purview, so that wasn't a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3171)|
| 0:52:56| That this was approved in 2006, we kind of, you know, we collectively kind of helped create this situation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3176)|
| 0:53:04| in approving this and then using those funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3184)|
| 0:53:06| And now we've got a situation out there where we've got a piece of property that's not developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3186)|
| 0:53:11| It's laying dormant for now probably three, four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3191)|
| 0:53:16| There's an opportunity, you know, I think the word work out was used here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3196)|
| 0:53:20| to kind of get a new ownership group in there and get this thing completed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3200)|
| 0:53:24| to where it could be a benefit to Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| And then ultimately, you know, then there was the fact that the new school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3207)|
| 0:53:30| this is 14 acres of this site had been purchased by the school board to put a new elementary school out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3210)|
| 0:53:37| And I'm not sure what the timing on that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3217)|
| 0:53:40| I expect maybe in the next couple of years, but I don't know that to be certain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3220)|
| 0:53:45| And then the IDB said, well, we need to get this back, you know, before the elected bodies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3225)|
| 0:53:49| and, you know, see if they still support this project and the use of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3229)|
| 0:53:53| So I've given you a lot about that, but, you know, so kind of going forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3233)|
| 0:53:58| there's been a little bit of discussion about and in the policies and procedures| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3238)|
| 0:54:02| to the things that you specifically addressed, Dr. Briggs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3242)|
| 0:54:05| but felt like this one was a unique case because of when it was approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3245)|
| 0:54:10| Now, this property also is in the city of Knoxville, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3250)|
| 0:54:13| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3253)|
| 0:54:14| Yes, because it's one of those carve out finger annexations, whatever you want to call it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3254)|
| 0:54:21| You know, I think this really, I think we as a body need to really look at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3261)|
| 0:54:30| I'm still deliberating how I'm going to vote on this thing, to be honest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3270)|
| 0:54:33| But this may be a little bit different because this TIF was approved at one point six years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3273)|
| 0:54:39| I don't know if we want to just be approving TIFs as an economic development tool other than in blighted areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3279)|
| 0:54:48| It was approved five years ago now, and that may be an exception that may sway my opinion on this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3288)|
| 0:54:56| but I think this is something we've got to look at very, very carefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3296)|
| 0:54:59| or any time anybody's building something in Knox County, they're going to come and want a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3299)|
| 0:55:05| And I think we have to be careful with those things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3305)|
| 0:55:08| We always talk about having tax advantages for economic development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3308)|
| 0:55:12| but basically for a number of years, depending upon the length of the TIF that's approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| is the county won't be benefiting from any of those tax advantages for development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3317)|
| 0:55:25| So I think we have to look at these very carefully,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| that we're just not subsidizing something that we're not going to be benefiting from, you know, as we deliberate this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3327)|
| 0:55:36| Mr. McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3336)|
| 0:55:38| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3338)|
| 0:55:40| Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| Mr. Napier, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3343)|
| 0:55:47| How long is this TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3347)|
| 0:55:49| Let me answer that first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3349)|
| 0:55:50| It was a 20-year TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3350)|
| 0:55:52| My understanding is that they're not asking for that to be extended past, you know, when it started in 2007.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3352)|
| 0:56:00| So it's about 16 and a half years left on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| Commissioner Briggs touched on most of the points that I wanted to touch on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3365)|
| 0:56:12| but I guess I'll give a different slant to it in terms of his questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3372)|
| 0:56:17| I think I have a different kind of outcome on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3377)|
| 0:56:22| If anywhere, if any place in this county, that although it's been a three-year period,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3382)|
| 0:56:29| that we've put a lot of money in is this southwest sector.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3389)|
| 0:56:34| I mean, right adjacent to it, we've, with no argument, did a lot of argument over other schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3394)|
| 0:56:41| but with no argument, we said this school needs, I mean, this area needs infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| You look at some of the Rose projects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3406)|
| 0:56:49| That area needs infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3409)|
| 0:56:51| So in terms of the benefit, and the reason is that's where the property tax is at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3411)|
| 0:56:56| That's where the business is moving and the revenues are going to come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3416)|
| 0:56:59| So for us to look at this today, and I, you know, I wasn't here in 2006,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3419)|
| 0:57:05| but I've been elected, you know, to serve and represent in 2011.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3425)|
| 0:57:10| Here I am evaluating this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3430)|
| 0:57:14| And this doesn't seem like a good deal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3434)|
| 0:57:17| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3437)|
| 0:57:20| I understand this project is laid dormant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3440)|
| 0:57:23| However, if we're, if we can sell a piece of real estate, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3443)|
| 0:57:30| southwest Knott's County or southwest Knoxville, because it was finger antics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3450)|
| 0:57:34| should be an area where we can do it without a $9 million TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3454)|
| 0:57:41| So, you know, I'm not going to belabor the point,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3461)|
| 0:57:44| but I did have a lot of the same questions that I think philosophically,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3464)|
| 0:57:48| and I think you all agree that we've kind of gone in a different direction now in how we handle these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3468)|
| 0:57:54| And I just think this was, I don't know, I won't comment on what the economics were in 2006| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3474)|
| 0:58:01| and what that area looked like in 2006, but today it doesn't look like an area that needs a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3481)|
| 0:58:07| If the halls of Walmart didn't need a TIF, surely, you know, if you look at per capita income, you look at businesses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3487)|
| 0:58:15| you look at the infrastructure, you look at all these things, this can't be an area that needs a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3495)|
| 0:58:21| If we're using today's ruler, you know, we had a slide rule, but now we're in calculator, you know, realm,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3501)|
| 0:58:30| and I think that needs to be the filter that we look at this with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3515)|
| 0:58:37| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3517)|
| 0:58:40| Thanks, Todd, and I do also have some question about the appropriateness of this TIF in terms of, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3520)|
| 0:58:49| the intent of TIFs being towards urban renewal and the but-for test and so on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3529)|
| 0:58:54| I also have a question sort of in regards to the application process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3534)|
| 0:59:01| And so would you, Todd, or somebody, describe, all right, so this TIF is conforming to a previous TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3541)|
| 0:59:15| Was there a reapplication?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| What's the rules about application for this TIF as, I mean, as it regards the previous TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3558)|
| 0:59:26| The IDB adopted a set of policies and procedures after this was approved and put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3566)|
| 0:59:38| And then the IDB has the option to waive or make exceptions as necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3578)|
| 0:59:45| You know, I am not the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3585)|
| 0:59:48| I'm here to speak on behalf of them as their staff person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3588)|
| 0:59:53| But, you know, what I heard was this had already been approved basically by both bodies and the IDB in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3593)|
| 1:00:01| We needed to get it back before you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3601)|
| 1:00:03| In order to do that, we would take it to the IDB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3603)|
| 1:00:07| They would consider it and then send it on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3607)|
| 1:00:09| So here's your, you know, your opportunity to decide whether or not you still support that or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3609)|
| 1:00:14| So this is not, was not handled like a brand new TIF application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3614)|
| 1:00:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3621)|
| 1:00:22| So if it's not handled as a brand new TIF application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3622)|
| 1:00:27| then there's some rules or some premise that applies to this TIF to allow it to go forward, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3627)|
| 1:00:39| Say that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3639)|
| 1:00:40| I'm not sure I followed you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3640)|
| 1:00:42| Well, if this TIF is piggybacking the previous TIF| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3642)|
| 1:00:47| and there was not a reapplication process necessary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| then it's meeting some standards or some structure that allows it to fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3651)|
| 1:00:59| I mean, to be acceptable to the body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3659)|
| 1:01:04| So the body and your legal counsel is saying this fits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3664)|
| 1:01:09| this financing structure fits the cause, you know, for whatever reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3669)|
| 1:01:15| If you break down the numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3675)|
| 1:01:17| how much you're spending on the public and infrastructure is fundamentally the same or something,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3677)|
| 1:01:24| something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3684)|
| 1:01:25| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3685)|
| 1:01:26| This is the infrastructure that was being contemplated in the TIF when this body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3686)|
| 1:01:31| I know you're a different body, but when this body approved it in 2006, it's the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3691)|
| 1:01:37| The numbers are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3697)|
| 1:01:40| They're coming back, you know, came back to the IDB| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| because they needed to change the financing structure of the economic impact plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3702)|
| 1:01:48| And so, you know, the IDB felt like that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3708)|
| 1:01:53| this merited moving forward for your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3713)|
| 1:01:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| So if it's fundamentally the same, then you could provide and show us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3718)|
| 1:02:02| and provide the numbers that support that statement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3722)|
| 1:02:09| What I have, when we went through this, I mean, I have sent you what I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3729)|
| 1:02:15| You know, there's a few other things in here, but we've checked our numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3735)|
| 1:02:18| When these TIFs originally came through, there was not all this validation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3738)|
| 1:02:24| It was a new law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3744)|
| 1:02:26| It was, you know, we didn't even have the engineering, you know, check as far as the cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3746)|
| 1:02:30| We do that now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3750)|
| 1:02:31| We've done that on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3751)|
| 1:02:33| Their costs check out is what they're saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3753)|
| 1:02:35| The components are the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3755)|
| 1:02:45| Commissioner Shouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| Thank you, Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3767)|
| 1:02:50| I have, I agree with some of the things that have been said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3770)|
| 1:02:54| but unfortunately disagree with some of the others from some of my colleagues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3774)|
| 1:02:59| I've cooed off on these TIFs the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3779)|
| 1:03:03| I remember the city doing something 30 years ago to do parking decks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3783)|
| 1:03:06| Two of the parking decks surrounding us here over the bank building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3786)|
| 1:03:09| and that bank building were done with TIFs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3789)|
| 1:03:11| which was sort of a stretch of why the TIFs were invented, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3791)|
| 1:03:16| But I would, I remember voting against one a year or so ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3796)|
| 1:03:20| and I did not and would not have supported the TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3800)|
| 1:03:23| the big box out in the suburban part of Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| I go, this, of course, it's in Commissioner Owensby's district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3809)|
| 1:03:33| the district I used to represent, so I know it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3813)|
| 1:03:35| I drive past it three or four times a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3815)|
| 1:03:37| There's a three or four-story building sitting there, been there for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3817)|
| 1:03:41| I've had 50 people say, what's going on in that thing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3821)|
| 1:03:44| I said, I don't know, nothing, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3824)|
| 1:03:47| And it's certainly not blighted property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3827)|
| 1:03:51| but it's not a virgin forest either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| I mean, a lot of work has been done, or millions of dollars of work has been done there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3833)|
| 1:03:57| I assume, by this South Carolina guy who went bust or left town| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3837)|
| 1:04:02| and lost a lot of money on the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3842)|
| 1:04:06| And I think this is a TIF that I can support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3846)|
| 1:04:11| I've made the statement I support them within the CBID very strongly,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3851)|
| 1:04:16| the blighted properties, the old buildings downtown that Mr. Birch and Dewhurst and those guys work on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3856)|
| 1:04:22| and I've been cool on them out in suburbia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3862)|
| 1:04:26| I would have been cool, I think, on the one south that you referenced if I'd have been sitting here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3866)|
| 1:04:31| but that was before my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3871)|
| 1:04:34| This is a pretty complex project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| A school's going in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| A school's going to go in, regardless of what happens in that building on North Shore| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| or to the multi-acres behind it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3882)|
| 1:04:46| And it's, I think, a movie theater's planned, some big boxes, of course,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3886)|
| 1:04:54| but I guess that's what makes it cash flow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| But it's a complex project with the amenities, the trails, the work around the lake and so forth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3898)|
| 1:05:05| and I just feel that if there's a place for a TIF, this is a good place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3905)|
| 1:05:11| I mean, I can support this unequivocally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| It's the project and the previous developer, I assume, was the victim of the economic downturn, like many people have been,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3914)|
| 1:05:22| but also I think it shows the complexities of this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3922)|
| 1:05:26| and it's a fairly tough project to make the numbers work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3926)|
| 1:05:30| I just hope that the commission can support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| I think it's, I want to look at these closely because, again, when the TIFs come along,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3934)|
| 1:05:38| I start getting a little nervous and start running the numbers and thinking, well, this, is this really,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3938)|
| 1:05:45| does it really pass the but-for criteria?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3945)|
| 1:05:49| I think this one does, and I think we're fortunate, our community's fortunate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3949)|
| 1:05:54| to have the caliber of investors and developers behind this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3954)|
| 1:05:59| If you look at some of the things they've done in this community, they're all top quality stuff, and I certainly support it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3959)|
| 1:06:06| Commissioner Wright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3966)|
| 1:06:08| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3968)|
| 1:06:10| Dr. Briggs took my words but he didn't say them before my time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3970)|
| 1:06:16| 2006, 2007, I believe the philosophy of county commission was a little different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3976)|
| 1:06:23| Economic times were a little bit different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| Commissioner McKenzie moved on with that, asking the question, is this TIF a redo of a TIF we've already done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3987)|
| 1:06:36| And I think the answer that was given was it's the same TIF with the same expiration date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=3996)|
| 1:06:42| Am I correct in hearing that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4002)|
| 1:06:44| In other words, you're not looking for 20 years from today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4004)|
| 1:06:46| You're looking just to fulfill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4006)|
| 1:06:49| And then I believe I'd like to point out is probably the Paul Pinkston rule that TIFs probably can't change hands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4009)|
| 1:06:57| with change of ownership.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4017)|
| 1:06:58| I believe he asked us, or we may have that in some of our background material, that if a TIF were to change hands,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4018)|
| 1:07:09| I believe his attempt was to make sure that it didn't change hands at the first owner making an obscene profit was his concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4029)|
| 1:07:20| In this particular instance, the first owner is no longer with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4040)|
| 1:07:28| The thing that I really wanted to get to was did you bring a storyboard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4048)|
| 1:07:31| Do you have a picture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4051)|
| 1:07:32| Is there a drawing out here somewhere?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4052)|
| 1:07:34| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4054)|
| 1:07:35| My name is Bud Cullum, 6312 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4055)|
| 1:07:39| I need someone to hold that up for just a second because I drove up and down those roads Saturday morning with my lovely spouse.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4059)|
| 1:07:47| We did not get to eat at Red Robin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4067)|
| 1:07:49| We had to go to Ruby Tuesdays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4069)|
| 1:07:53| The thing that concerns me is that the area has changed and that there is a new school going to be where?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4073)|
| 1:08:01| Where is the new school going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4081)|
| 1:08:04| Where are the roads that the school people are going to get their big buses on and off this site?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4084)|
| 1:08:14| No, his print is upright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4094)|
| 1:08:20| I can read, I can see the letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4100)|
| 1:08:22| It says North Shore Town Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4102)|
| 1:08:24| Now he's going to turn it upside down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4104)|
| 1:08:29| Where is the school buses going to go?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4109)|
| 1:08:35| And whose road is that going to be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4115)|
| 1:08:39| Is it there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4119)|
| 1:08:40| I did not take that street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| I took the green one up through the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4122)|
| 1:08:48| Okay, so thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4128)|
| 1:08:50| That particular street then is probably, in my opinion, needs to be a little bit wider.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4130)|
| 1:08:55| Will it be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4135)|
| 1:08:56| Is this a part of the project?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4136)|
| 1:08:58| The only question I'm asking right now since the school is now interjected into this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4138)|
| 1:09:04| I agree with Commissioner Shouse to believe it needs to probably move along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4144)|
| 1:09:07| I just want to make sure that we've got the best we can get there for the school site that's up the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4147)|
| 1:09:13| and that I did travel up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4153)|
| 1:09:15| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4155)|
| 1:09:19| Commissioner Smith, do you have something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4159)|
| 1:09:22| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4162)|
| 1:09:26| Pull that down so I can see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4166)|
| 1:09:29| Again, Bud Collum, I did want to, if you would let me, to address two or three of the commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4169)|
| 1:09:35| I think, first of all, they were very good comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4175)|
| 1:09:38| I appreciate those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4178)|
| 1:09:40| One thing I would like for all of this board to understand is that as we traditionally think of a blighted area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4180)|
| 1:09:50| we traditionally think of an urban core type situation, an old industrial use, say, that has sat for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4190)|
| 1:09:59| And although this area certainly does not qualify from that standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4199)|
| 1:10:04| I think you could make an argument that this property in and of itself has been blighted because it has sat,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4204)|
| 1:10:12| it's actually sat for longer than three years in a situation when we took it over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4212)|
| 1:10:19| the way we actually took it over is we purchased at auction the bank debt on this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4219)|
| 1:10:26| and then had to take it through foreclosure from the previous owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4226)|
| 1:10:31| Part of what went into our thinking on that is that we did know at the time that there had been a TIF approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4231)|
| 1:10:38| One other thing to keep in mind, and obviously, as Commissioner Shouse said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4238)|
| 1:10:44| maybe it was the economic times that we have found ourselves in for the last couple of years that did this other developer in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4244)|
| 1:10:53| I'm not so sure it was strictly that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4253)|
| 1:10:55| I won't cast aspersion on a fellow developer, but one of the things that caused problems is they came in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4255)|
| 1:11:03| and, if you will recall, there was a new zoning code that was written almost specifically for this project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4263)|
| 1:11:11| and it was zoned for a new urbanism type development that involved a lot of public amenities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4271)|
| 1:11:20| that Mr. Harrison spoke to briefly a minute ago, such as boardwalks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4280)|
| 1:11:25| We have a lake feature that we're planning, an amphitheater with a boardwalk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4285)|
| 1:11:29| All of this would be public amenities, not to mention extending a tremendous amount of greenway type pedestrian paths,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4289)|
| 1:11:37| not only through our property proper, but also along the right of way at North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4297)|
| 1:11:45| Several other things I feel like need to be brought to light is that for us to be able to continue for the bulk of this development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4305)|
| 1:11:57| along the new urbanism theme, it requires a lot of roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4317)|
| 1:12:03| It requires a lot of different public amenities that strictly there's no way we'll pencil out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4323)|
| 1:12:11| We're having a little bit of difficulty making sure we're going to pencil out all of the public improvements we're doing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4331)|
| 1:12:17| even if this TIF is improved, because what we're planning on spending,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4337)|
| 1:12:21| the last budget proposal I received was more in the line of $14 million to $15 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4341)|
| 1:12:26| all of which would fall under a TIF-approvable expenditure, even though we're not asking for more than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4346)|
| 1:12:33| The slip ramp off of Pellissippi Parkway is something that's gone all the way through the Federal Highway Administration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4353)|
| 1:12:41| It is something that the Tennessee Department of Transportation has said will greatly enhance not only when the school's there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4361)|
| 1:12:50| not only when our development's there, but it would enhance, if nothing else is built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4370)|
| 1:12:54| it would enhance the traffic situation coming off of Pellissippi Parkway and then needing to travel west on North Shore Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4374)|
| 1:13:02| I also might point out that this project and some of the funds out of this $9 million are going to be expended on exit ramps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4382)|
| 1:13:12| and on ramps off of now Interstate 140.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4392)|
| 1:13:16| I still refer to it as Pellissippi Parkway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4396)|
| 1:13:19| But these are things that would not typically fall under any kind of a scope of a private developer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4399)|
| 1:13:26| even if there was a traffic study that was strictly issued for a highway occupancy permit into a single shopping center| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4406)|
| 1:13:35| or a single commercial development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| A couple other things that needed to be added is there's an issue not only existing right now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4418)|
| 1:13:45| but will become as growth recurs, or hopefully occurs again, and as the school is built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4425)|
| 1:13:53| North Shore bottlenecks into a two-lane road just pass, or actually through this development because there's two lake features.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4433)|
| 1:14:02| Those lake features are controlled by TVA because they actually fluctuate with the level of Fort Loudoun and the Tennessee River.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4442)|
| 1:14:10| We have had extensive discussions not only with TDOT, but with TVA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4450)|
| 1:14:17| and one of the issues is it would be very hard for TDOT to simply come in and widen that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4457)|
| 1:14:25| because that was built as a land bridge with a culvert,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| and to simply come in and build that back would require TVA giving up water storage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4468)|
| 1:14:35| I don't know if any of you are that familiar with TVA, but that's not something they generally like to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4475)|
| 1:14:39| In fact, hardly ever do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4479)|
| 1:14:42| We have come up with a plan that, again, would be a part of these TIF funds to alleviate that concern| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4482)|
| 1:14:51| by giving up some of our property, making one of those lake features on our side larger,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4491)|
| 1:14:56| and at that point allow us to then widen, put a longer culvert and widen that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4496)|
| 1:15:04| not only widen it wide enough for that to be a five-lane stretch right through there that would help the school buses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4504)|
| 1:15:10| and our traffic and all of the traffic that currently exists west of there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4510)|
| 1:15:15| but it would also have a ten-foot-wide greenway extension through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4515)|
| 1:15:20| So I think there's a lot of things that really are different about this, and I would like to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4520)|
| 1:15:27| I think it was Commissioner McKenzie mentioned the Walmart and halls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4527)|
| 1:15:30| and that happened to be a project that I was involved in also, so I think I can speak from knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4530)|
| 1:15:37| We did, I will admit, we did approach this board and the IDB about the possibility of a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4537)|
| 1:15:44| and we, at the time we were turned down, we went ahead with the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4544)|
| 1:15:52| This is, I hate to be the boy that, or sound like the boy that cried wolf,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4552)|
| 1:15:57| but this really is an animal of a different stripe, if you will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4557)|
| 1:16:01| The amount of roads that we would be building that would be dedicated to the city of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4561)|
| 1:16:06| in conjunction with the magnitude of the dollars spent on the state and federal roads| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4566)|
| 1:16:12| and with traffic signal improvements and the public improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4572)|
| 1:16:18| I really think makes the merits of this project much different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4578)|
| 1:16:23| One thing I do, this may sound a little selfish, but I do want to point out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4583)|
| 1:16:28| Mr. Napier mentioned that the school purchased 14 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4588)|
| 1:16:32| From a selfish standpoint for our group, I want to make it known that the school purchased a little over five acres| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| and we donated a little over nine acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4598)|
| 1:16:41| So we're trying to be good citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4601)|
| 1:16:45| This definitely is a project that will have to be completely redesigned without the public infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4605)|
| 1:16:52| if we can't get this TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4615)|
| 1:16:58| Hey, Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4618)|
| 1:16:59| Question for Doug Battelle, if he doesn't mind coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4619)|
| 1:17:05| There's been a lot of talk about parks in addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4625)|
| 1:17:09| Doug, I just want to know what, for that area, how many parts kind of serve that area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4629)|
| 1:17:18| and what kind of, you don't have to put square acres on it, but what parts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4638)|
| 1:17:24| What parts serve that immediate area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4644)|
| 1:17:27| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4647)|
| 1:17:28| In the southwest sector, the closest parks there would be Admiral Farragut, Carl Cowan, and then Concord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| So that's about 700 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4652)|
| 1:17:34| It's a good chunk of parkland in the southwest part of the county, but it is deeper in southwest Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4654)|
| 1:17:40| In terms of deeper, what, a mile, within a mile or so?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4660)|
| 1:17:44| From there, probably two to three miles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4664)|
| 1:17:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4667)|
| 1:17:48| So those parks, significant parks, I guess is my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4668)|
| 1:17:55| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4676)|
| 1:17:57| But, you know, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4677)|
| 1:18:01| I just have to take issue with, you know, again, the whole point and purpose of TIFs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4681)|
| 1:18:08| You know, I just can't see blight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4688)|
| 1:18:10| I can't see blight when I see North Shore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4690)|
| 1:18:14| That area has sat for the last two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| We all know we were in economic downturn for the last two or three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4696)|
| 1:18:20| That area will develop, guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| It's going to develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| So for us to sit and say, well, it may not develop, you know, we really need to TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4705)|
| 1:18:31| The only way it's going to develop is with a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4711)|
| 1:18:34| I beg to differ.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| And, again, these aren't our dollars that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4717)|
| 1:18:40| We're talking about taxpayer dollars that are going to go, cost avoidance or whatever you want to call it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4720)|
| 1:18:49| that we're not going to recoup.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4729)|
| 1:18:51| And so I just can't see how we can approve this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4731)|
| 1:19:02| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4742)|
| 1:19:04| Could I address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4744)|
| 1:19:05| Go ahead, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4745)|
| 1:19:06| One thing I want to point out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4746)|
| 1:19:07| I don't think it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4747)|
| 1:19:09| I'm not standing here trying to argue that this property would never develop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4749)|
| 1:19:13| I am arguing that the road improvements that we're suggesting doing and paying for out of the TIF funds| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4753)|
| 1:19:20| will never happen from a private developer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| Those improvements, if they are wanted, which actually they're needed because most of those intersections| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4763)|
| 1:19:28| are almost in a failure state right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4768)|
| 1:19:31| So that is money that's ultimately going to have to come from the general funds of some government entity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4771)|
| 1:19:38| whether that's the state, the city, the county, or a combination thereof.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4778)|
| 1:19:41| So, although I agree, we're talking about a very good demographic area as general,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4781)|
| 1:19:50| but the infrastructure improvements that we're talking about making are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4790)|
| 1:19:57| If we never build another building out there, those infrastructure improvements are needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4797)|
| 1:20:02| This is a way, I think, that's the classic situation where a TIF makes sense,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4802)|
| 1:20:08| is those infrastructure improvements can be built now when they're needed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4808)|
| 1:20:13| and they can ride the shoulders of private development and private enterprise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| And with that, I want to point out that we have two retailers that are teed up ready to commit to this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4817)|
| 1:20:23| if we get this improved or approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| And neither one of these would be relocations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4827)|
| 1:20:30| One would be a tenant that currently has stores in the area, but it would be a new store.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4830)|
| 1:20:36| The other would be a completely new store to this market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4836)|
| 1:20:41| and the plan probably would be to also, I know the plan is to build additional units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4841)|
| 1:20:47| So we're talking about not only a tremendous improvement to infrastructure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4847)|
| 1:20:53| that currently needs to be improved and there's no funds in the budget to do that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4853)|
| 1:20:57| we're talking about a lot of jobs, a lot of new sales tax revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4857)|
| 1:21:03| Some would argue you don't actually gain new sales tax, you just move it around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4863)|
| 1:21:07| In this particular case, I think there will be a gain, certainly from Blount County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4867)|
| 1:21:13| So a question along those lines then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4873)|
| 1:21:16| What percent of this $9 million is going toward roads and access issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4876)|
| 1:21:21| and what percent is going toward the greenways and parks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4881)|
| 1:21:26| I don't have a percentage of that off the top of my head, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4886)|
| 1:21:30| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4890)|
| 1:21:31| I know that the amount of road improvements we're doing will cost more than the total $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4891)|
| 1:21:40| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4900)|
| 1:21:42| That's a good question, Sam.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4902)|
| 1:21:43| We need to know that breakdown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| That would help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4905)|
| 1:21:46| But on this, what's the total acreage on this total development?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4906)|
| 1:21:51| It is, we purchased 134 acres,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4911)|
| 1:21:55| but there were already some houses built in the back residential part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4915)|
| 1:21:59| So I'm thinking it was probably about 155, 150 acres.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4919)|
| 1:22:05| How much of it is going to be public space that we're talking about?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4925)|
| 1:22:10| I probably need to get that calculation just to answer the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4930)|
| 1:22:14| that Commissioner McKenzie just asked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4934)|
| 1:22:16| And I was curious to how much parking, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| how available would it be for the public to utilize the amphitheater, the lake?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| All of it, all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4942)|
| 1:22:24| But how much parking would be available for people to come up and use it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4944)|
| 1:22:29| Oh, as far as number of spaces?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| Well, one of the, do we have a parking count?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4951)|
| 1:22:38| One thing, Commissioner Smith, you need to understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4958)|
| 1:22:41| this is probably going to be a project that's done in two or three phases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4961)|
| 1:22:45| just even the commercial part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4965)|
| 1:22:47| And as you can see, if Jim can walk this up a little closer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4967)|
| 1:22:52| why don't you walk it up while I speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4972)|
| 1:22:55| is that with the slip ramp design and the new boulevard design,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4975)|
| 1:23:02| it kind of lends itself to about four quadrants of development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4982)|
| 1:23:07| What we envision is probably we've come up with several designs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4987)|
| 1:23:16| on how to put an amphitheater along with a boardwalk around the lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=4996)|
| 1:23:21| potentially even a pier into the lake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5001)|
| 1:23:24| and that would be then with restaurants around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5004)|
| 1:23:28| Then we have a grocery store and shops on another quadrant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5008)|
| 1:23:33| We have another quadrant with the big box that he's showing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5013)|
| 1:23:38| The quadrant next to that is what the design on the board he has| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5018)|
| 1:23:42| would be a traditional town center boulevard where you come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5022)|
| 1:23:46| and you park right on the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5026)|
| 1:23:48| It would be two-story and one side potentially being townhouses over the retail.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5028)|
| 1:23:55| But all of that parking would be public access parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5035)|
| 1:24:03| During a break or something, I'd like to look more at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5043)|
| 1:24:06| There's thousands of spaces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5046)|
| 1:24:07| And just for clarification, in 2006, that's always been in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5047)|
| 1:24:14| I don't know when it was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5054)|
| 1:24:15| Ever since we've been involved, and I think clear back to 2006, it was in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5055)|
| 1:24:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5059)|
| 1:24:20| And quick question for Todd, just for clarification, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5060)|
| 1:24:22| Todd, has your IDB board, have they approved this in just a recent meeting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5062)|
| 1:24:26| I know they approved it back in 2006.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5066)|
| 1:24:28| They approved it at a meeting earlier this month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5068)|
| 1:24:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5072)|
| 1:24:33| And there was a, in some of the information I sent to you all,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5073)|
| 1:24:37| was a breakdown of what they projected their public improvement costs would be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5077)|
| 1:24:41| And it said $785,000 would be on the public boardwalk greenways and recreational.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5081)|
| 1:24:50| Has the city up to, have they voted yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5090)|
| 1:24:53| This evening at 7 o'clock.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5093)|
| 1:24:57| Before I get to Commissioner, I'm going to ask some questions, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5097)|
| 1:25:00| But go ahead, Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5100)|
| 1:25:01| If you want to go ahead and ask your questions, I'll.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5101)|
| 1:25:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5103)|
| 1:25:05| The total investment that we're talking about here, you said, is $9 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5105)|
| 1:25:09| The TIF would be $9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5109)|
| 1:25:11| No, I'm talking about the investment into the, the investment you're looking at into this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5111)|
| 1:25:15| No, we're looking at significantly more than $9 million investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5115)|
| 1:25:18| That's what I thought.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5118)|
| 1:25:19| So this property has been there, you said, it's been dormant for like three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5119)|
| 1:25:24| This is the first project of this magnitude that has come before us in quite some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5124)|
| 1:25:29| Hopefully this shows an improvement in the economy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5129)|
| 1:25:32| Hopefully this shows that things are beginning to turn around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5132)|
| 1:25:34| and that we're starting to see some improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5134)|
| 1:25:37| We've talked a lot about the fact that you're going to do road improvements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| that you're going to be building retail, you're going to be building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5140)|
| 1:25:44| My point is, somebody's going to have to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| So the jobs that are going to be provided through contractors, builders, pipe fitters, plumbers, etc.,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5147)|
| 1:25:57| it seems to me is going to be pretty significant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5157)|
| 1:26:01| And so as we look at the benefit that is going to be from this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5161)|
| 1:26:05| yes, we're going to be getting an amphitheater, which I want to talk to you about, by the way, when it's done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5165)|
| 1:26:10| But also we're talking about some greenways and so forth, but also we're talking about jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5170)|
| 1:26:15| We're talking about providing employment for a group of people that I think have been the economic downturn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5175)|
| 1:26:23| They've suffered greatly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| And so when you look at the income that's going to be generated from these folks, this way I'm looking at it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5185)|
| 1:26:31| it's a trickle-down effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5191)|
| 1:26:33| You folks are willing to come in and put your necks on the line to say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5193)|
| 1:26:36| we want to develop this property, we want to do all of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5196)|
| 1:26:40| It seems to me Knox County benefits greatly because we're going to see a lot of our citizens back to work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5200)|
| 1:26:46| or they're going to be getting jobs, and we're not talking about minimum wage jobs here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5206)|
| 1:26:49| We're talking about good jobs and good opportunities for people to come in as this is being developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5209)|
| 1:26:54| So I see tremendous benefit from this, and I'm excited about the prospect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5214)|
| 1:27:00| We just saw in the newspaper a couple of days ago where 200 jobs are leaving us in the mascot area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5220)|
| 1:27:06| That's 200 families that are going to be affected by that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| Here we've got an opportunity for a project that's going to put people to work, that's going to give people more income.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5230)|
| 1:27:15| That excites me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5235)|
| 1:27:17| I'll be voting in favor of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5237)|
| 1:27:19| So I just wanted to get my statement out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5241)|
| 1:27:22| You know, this is very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5242)|
| 1:27:24| I appreciate everything that everyone said on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5244)|
| 1:27:26| This is a very important vote that we're taking on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5246)|
| 1:27:29| Do we want to go ahead and vote on this today or defer this until Monday to get a little more information on some of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5249)|
| 1:27:36| just so we have everything that everyone's been asking for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5256)|
| 1:27:42| I'd really like to make a substitute motion we just defer the vote on this until Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5262)|
| 1:27:46| We have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5266)|
| 1:27:47| It's going to be deferred anyway because there's opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5267)|
| 1:27:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5271)|
| 1:27:52| And it'll be good to know what the city does tonight also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5272)|
| 1:27:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5274)|
| 1:27:55| Well, we can't make a solid decision today, a legal decision today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5275)|
| 1:27:58| We've got to vote on it legally next Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5278)|
| 1:28:01| Well, I mean, if we did make a decision today, it would go on the consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5281)|
| 1:28:04| I mean, depending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5284)|
| 1:28:05| I don't know what the vote's going to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5285)|
| 1:28:06| Do you want to send it on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| I'd like to send it on without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5287)|
| 1:28:09| So the motion is sent on without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5289)|
| 1:28:11| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5291)|
| 1:28:12| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5292)|
| 1:28:13| Commissioner Brown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5293)|
| 1:28:15| Just one question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5295)|
| 1:28:16| You mentioned, Mr. Cullum, this is going to be done in several phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5296)|
| 1:28:20| What kind of timeline are you looking at?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5300)|
| 1:28:23| The whole 20-year period of this TIF?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5303)|
| 1:28:26| I mean, when we talk about new jobs and all this kind of stuff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5306)|
| 1:28:30| you either put a whole lot of people to work immediately| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| or you stretch a few people out over 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5312)|
| 1:28:35| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5315)|
| 1:28:37| Obviously, it's hard for me to stand here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| and guarantee when the last piece of dirt would be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5321)|
| 1:28:46| However, to help ease some of your concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5326)|
| 1:28:49| I can say that the store, the larger store that sits right next to the slip ramp.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5329)|
| 1:29:09| So phase one would be the entire length of the property adjacent to Pellissippi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5349)|
| 1:29:14| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5354)|
| 1:29:16| In building the slip ramp and all of those streets| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5356)|
| 1:29:19| and those two stores that are depicted on that plan are not pie in the sky.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5359)|
| 1:29:27| They exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5367)|
| 1:29:29| Unfortunately, until they close on the land,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5369)|
| 1:29:32| they have asked me not to officially state who that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5372)|
| 1:29:36| It's been bandied about in the press and other things who it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| and they've been pretty good guesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5380)|
| 1:29:43| Hopefully, I got some information out without going against what was asked of me to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5383)|
| 1:29:50| But I will say this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5390)|
| 1:29:53| They are serious enough to the point that they have established the actual day they're going to open the store,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5393)|
| 1:30:00| and that's January 22nd of 2012, grand opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5400)|
| 1:30:05| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5405)|
| 1:30:07| July, that would be quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5407)|
| 1:30:09| July 22nd of 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5409)|
| 1:30:11| We are trying to be in a position to begin earthwork immediately after,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5411)|
| 1:30:17| if we get approval from City Council and County Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5417)|
| 1:30:21| and can work out our development agreement to begin earthwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5421)|
| 1:30:25| Commissioner Brown, I think what we would really like is in our planning and engineering of this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5425)|
| 1:30:31| we would look at it in phases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5431)|
| 1:30:33| What we would hope is that what the general public will see is this one big phase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5433)|
| 1:30:38| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5438)|
| 1:30:39| Well, I would agree with the postponement on this for now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5439)|
| 1:30:44| but providing that there's two or three things that have been asked of you to get back with us information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5444)|
| 1:30:50| can we have that by Monday?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5450)|
| 1:30:52| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5452)|
| 1:30:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5453)|
| 1:30:54| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5454)|
| 1:30:55| The motion is to send it on without a recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5455)|
| 1:30:57| All those in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocomws110222?start=5457)|
