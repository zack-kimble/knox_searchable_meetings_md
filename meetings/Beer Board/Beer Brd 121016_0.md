| 0:01:05| The first case for us tonight is Archer's BBQ on Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=65)|
| 0:01:06| I think this is a new business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=66)|
| 0:01:08| Would you come up to the podium and state your name and your address, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=68)|
| 0:01:12| My name is William Archer Bagley, III.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=72)|
| 0:01:16| And the address of Archer's BBQ is 5415 Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=76)|
| 0:01:23| Ms. Martin, files complete.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=83)|
| 0:01:27| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=87)|
| 0:01:29| You'll see that Nancy Allison was listed as has not been in for processing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=89)|
| 0:01:32| Today we received the fingerprints and background checks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=92)|
| 0:01:34| She's from out of state, so no applicable record for this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=94)|
| 0:01:38| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=98)|
| 0:01:40| Any questions, comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=100)|
| 0:01:43| Tell us a little bit about Archers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=103)|
| 0:01:45| We started off about like almost two years ago out in Farragut in February of 2011| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=105)|
| 0:01:52| because of issues with the landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=112)|
| 0:01:54| I bought my way out of the lease and relocated my restaurant to Bearden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=114)|
| 0:01:58| So we had a beer permit out there, and we never had any issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=118)|
| 0:02:04| We've been building out a commissary and all sorts of other stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=124)|
| 0:02:07| So this was something I was going to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=127)|
| 0:02:09| just right now getting around to it two months after opening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=129)|
| 0:02:12| Okay, what makes your barbecue better than all the others?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=132)|
| 0:02:15| Well, I'm the only person around here who grew up in Memphis who's actually selling barbecue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=135)|
| 0:02:20| Sounds like a plan to me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=140)|
| 0:02:21| Okay, do I have aâ€”| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=141)|
| 0:02:22| Madam Chair, I just want to say I've eaten there, and it is very good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=142)|
| 0:02:25| I highly recommend that all of you go and try it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=145)|

| 0:02:33| Second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=153)|
| 0:02:34| It's in the second district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=154)|
| 0:02:35| And I move we approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=155)|
| 0:02:37| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=157)|

| 0:03:22| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=202)|

| 0:03:49| The address for the location is 10901 Suite 101 on Parkside Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=229)|

| 0:03:57| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=237)|
| 0:03:58| Sergeant Hunter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=238)|
| 0:03:59| Mr. Kumar has not been in for processing yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=239)|
| 0:04:01| Ms. Martin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=241)|
| 0:04:03| We're waiting on a copy of the sales tax registration, the LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=243)|
| 0:04:07| certificate of zoning, and approval from the fire inspector,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=247)|
| 0:04:10| building inspector, and health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=250)|
| 0:04:12| Yeah, we are still finishing the remodeling in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=252)|
| 0:04:14| and once that's done the building and the fire would be in place, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=254)|
| 0:04:17| And the training, the records?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=257)|
| 0:04:19| I've already finished the task force, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=259)|
| 0:04:21| Okay, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=261)|
| 0:04:22| I've already done the fingerprinting as well, but my partner was not there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=262)|
| 0:04:24| and that's Mr. Kumar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=264)|
| 0:04:26| And he will be taken?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=266)|

| 0:04:29| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=269)|
| 0:04:30| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=270)|
| 0:04:32| What's our general procedure that he's not been in for processing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=272)|
| 0:04:36| Well, we have so far been approving pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=276)|
| 0:04:41| At one point, if they had not had the records check and the other things, the task class,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=281)|
| 0:04:51| then we postponed for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=291)|
| 0:04:53| We then decided that there were lots of times good reasons why they had not been in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=293)|
| 0:04:59| So we moved a few months ago to a policy of approving pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=299)|
| 0:05:06| Whatever the will of the board is, whatever we do, we need to be consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=306)|
| 0:05:10| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=310)|
| 0:05:11| And that's been the last couple of months we've changed that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=311)|
| 0:05:14| Probably the last six or eight months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=314)|
| 0:05:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=316)|
| 0:05:17| Has the other gentleman signed up to take the course and just hasn't completed it yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| I've already taken the course and completed it, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=321)|
| 0:05:23| Oh, the other gentleman that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=323)|
| 0:05:25| I don't think he was required to take the course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=325)|
| 0:05:27| They only wanted him to do the fingerprinting to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=327)|
| 0:05:29| And since we are from Nashville, he was not there that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=329)|
| 0:05:33| Only one person listed on the application is required to take the class.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=333)|
| 0:05:36| So all he needs to do is make an appointment with our office for the fingerprints and the background check.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=336)|
| 0:05:41| For the other partner, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| I'll move to approve pending final documentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=343)|
| 0:05:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=346)|
| 0:05:47| How long?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=347)|
| 0:05:48| Do we have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=348)|
| 0:05:49| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=349)|
| 0:05:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=350)|
| 0:05:51| All those in favor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=351)|
| 0:05:52| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=352)|
| 0:05:53| How long do you think it will be before you're actually ready to serve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=353)|
| 0:05:55| About a month, I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/BeerBrd121016?start=355)|
