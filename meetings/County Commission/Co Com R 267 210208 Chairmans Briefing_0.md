| 0:00:31| Welcome everybody and thank you for joining us for this third of six chairman's briefings for the legislative session so to speak, for this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=31)|
| 0:00:42| Thank you for your attendance. And tonight our topic will be or today our topic will be all about Knox County finances, which is very relevant, given the time of year that we're about to enter into budget season once again and this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=42)|
| 0:00:58| something that I appreciate the hard work from Chris Caldwell and his team, put together lots of information for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=58)|
| 0:01:05| As always, if you have questions either raise your hand in the participant window. Do one of these and wave at me as Commissioner Hill likes to do, or, or just, you know, send a text or something that says hey, I want to answer your question or of course| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=65)|
| 0:01:21| you can always stay until the end and there'll be a q amp a portion but feel free throughout this there's a lot of information so feel free throughout this to sort of jump in where you need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=81)|
| 0:01:31| The whole point of these chairman's briefings is to take a topic that warrants more discussion than, you know, a quick presentation at a commission or works out meeting, and to have a more deep dive and more concentrated effort to really kind of understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=91)|
| 0:01:46| why this is much more complicated than we can sort of hop into an agenda so that's the whole point tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=106)|
| 0:01:53| Of course, if, if you're able to just stay on mute until you have that question I'll keep the background noise down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=113)|
| 0:01:59| And if for anybody who is not here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=119)|
| 0:02:03| is not able to attend. We will send out the recording and the presentation afterwards, so they can view it at another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=123)|
| 0:02:11| And then other notes just real quick is if you have upcoming topics that you're interested there are three more scheduled April 5 June 14 and August 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=131)|
| 0:02:21| The only idea that I have a couple of my ideas of the on there was an idea from Commissioner skin maker about learning more about virtual courtrooms and things from the shirt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=141)|
| 0:02:33| That you would like, please send them over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=153)|
| 0:02:36| And I'll do my best to kind of put together teams of people to help present and bring relevant ideas to the table so we can continue to sort of continuing education so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=156)|
| 0:02:47| Commissioner Hill, did you want to jump in off the bat here. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=167)|
| 0:02:51| My zoom app does not have the hand wave. Oh, okay, I need an update.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=171)|
| 0:02:58| So, that's why I always, that's why I always put my hand up. And also Commissioner Jay did you receive my, my recommendation for a chairman's brief also on the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=178)|
| 0:03:14| Do you recall, you're right, you're right I did. I'm sorry that's another one that's in the hopper Yes, thank you for reminding me I will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=194)|
| 0:03:20| I'll refer back to that. That's all right. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. All right. Well, without further ado, as we enter a budget season I have asked Chris Caldwell our director of finance to assemble his team and gather lots of relevant| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=200)|
| 0:03:36| information for us and some other issues that will be coming up in finance in the next few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=216)|
| 0:03:42| And I'll turn it over him and of course everything in this presentation will be sent to you afterwards so thank you for your hard work Chris thanks everybody in attendance and take it away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=222)|
| 0:03:53| Thank you Chairman Jay, thank you for having us I have Jennifer Bodie in the room who mainly did all the work on this but she likes to hide and stay in the background so I don't make her get on camera so that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=233)|
| 0:04:07| We'll get through this I've got a PowerPoint and I will try to share my screen. The best that I know how and we'll go through these, these slides with this information on it and then you all stop at any time and ask questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=247)|
| 0:04:22| And we'll try to answer those to the best of our ability or get you an answer and so I will begin by trying to share my screen and we'll go from there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=262)|
| 0:04:53| We can see it just fine. Okay great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=293)|
| 0:04:58| Do one thing really quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=298)|
| 0:05:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=301)|
| 0:05:05| We will start out. What you see here is a slide of general fund revenues and expenses compared over the course of about nine or 10 years and so what you see on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=305)|
| 0:05:22| left hand axis is dollar amounts 120 million 200 million, which will concur with the blue and orange bar graph, and on the right hand side is percentages and it goes along with the with the gray percent of revenue change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=322)|
| 0:05:45| And so, then you see a linear line that kind of just shows you what our trend has been with revenue. And so, as you look at this, I can tell you that revenues from from 11 to 20 have went from about 155.8 million up to 200.9 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=345)|
| 0:06:09| So, that's substantial increase in revenue expensive expenses has followed a similar path of 155 million up to 194.3 million. Our expenses in 20 were actually about 300,000 less than they were in 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=369)|
| 0:06:25| Part of that would be because we enacted a spending freeze to around the first of April, related to the pandemic and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=385)|
| 0:06:36| the safer at home order so we had some reduction in expenses there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=396)|
| 0:06:42| And so that's why you see kind of a flat expense line from 19 to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=402)|
| 0:06:50| And then what you would see there is that percent change in revenue from 11 to 12 it grew by about 4.1%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=410)|
| 0:07:01| And then you can go on and actually 14 it was actually at a negative .88%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=421)|
| 0:07:11| Then it continues on growth and 16 was about 5.6% which is the high. And then the growth from 18, 19 and 20 has been 3.8%, 2.9% and 2.4%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=431)|
| 0:07:25| So that is percent of revenue growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=445)|
| 0:07:29| That is that's healthy growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=449)|
| 0:07:32| A lot of our surrounding counties don't see the growth that we are really happy to see that comes from us and the general fund it can come from a number of places but a lot of that is focused on property tax growth sales tax growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=452)|
| 0:07:53| Some growth in utility pilots and one thing that's going away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=473)|
| 0:08:00| After this fiscal year will be the whole income tax and so we account for that in the budget but we won't see that in any more and so I'm going to go on to the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=480)|
| 0:08:15| And it's basically looking at the general fund and what you see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=495)|
| 0:08:21| You're going to see the basically those percentage changes in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=501)|
| 0:08:33| Those are in blue that's what we just went over. We overlay that with a percent change of expenses which are in orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=513)|
| 0:08:44| And then the gray line is CPI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=524)|
| 0:08:47| And so what you see there is through from FY 12 to FY 20 you can see a growth in revenue growth and expenses of a percent change in revenue percent change in expenses and that can compare to CPI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=527)|
| 0:09:05| And then you can see the dotted line and so those are that's like a linear line that just flattens out that percent change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=545)|
| 0:09:15| So you can see that our percent change in revenue starts out a little bit over 3% and gets down to probably about 2.8%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=555)|
| 0:09:24| That expense line growth stays really constant at around 2.7% and then you see CPI and just for reference CPI hovers in there between looks like one and a half and goes up to about 1.8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=564)|
| 0:09:44| And so that those dotted lines I think is a good comparison to show you growth in revenue growth and expenses compared to CPI both above CPI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=584)|
| 0:09:58| You can see year over year sometimes that's not the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=598)|
| 0:10:03| But when you when you average it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=603)|
| 0:10:07| That's how it kind of flattens out we what you also see and for us this is important you'll see like a like some jumps in FY 16 and FY 19 and expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=607)|
| 0:10:20| When you just look at the at the solid line part of that could be for us is if we know we're having a really good year from a revenue standpoint it's not uncommon for us to do transfers to other funds transferred to special revenue funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=620)|
| 0:10:39| Which could be like solid waste oftentimes we have to try to help out to end the year. It could also be transferred to internal service funds, whether that is our self health insurance fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=639)|
| 0:10:54| It could be a risk management fund. It could be our employee benefits fund. And so oftentimes if revenues are ahead of expenses before we close out the fiscal year, we like to do transfers to try to keep those particular type of funds to the positive and in good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=654)|
| 0:11:18| And so, Chris, can I jump in. When I look at this graph, a couple things I want to just verify the jump out to me. If I look at the linear changes, although it's hard to kind of see, it does look like revenues are going down and expenses are going up those lines are, by the time we get to fiscal 20 are getting closer and closer and closer together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=678)|
| 0:11:41| And CPI seems to be growing a little bit higher but those sort of, we're kind of heading towards a connection point or even an opposite reaction, if I'm looking at how that's trending correctly and then I'm also looking at, you know, fiscal 1314.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=701)|
| 0:12:00| And then again in 16. And then again in 19 where expenses are much higher than our revenue and, and I'm assuming in those years we're using fund balances or other things to kind of make up those are years where we're truly not, you know, where our revenue is below our expenses we're using fund balance to make up the difference is that accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=720)|
| 0:12:22| Somewhat. So I will say this. What you're looking at, though, is a percent change in in revenue in those solid lines and so when you see a bigger change in in expenses than than revenues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=742)|
| 0:12:36| That's why you may see a bigger expense peak than a revenue peak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=756)|
| 0:12:43| So, oftentimes like in 16 and 19 we know that we cause those because of transfers to other funds. And so, by us doing those, those transfers. That's what makes that revenue line and expense line come come closer together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=763)|
| 0:13:01| If we didn't do those transfers and some cases, they are necessary and other cases, it's just kind of us thinking ahead from the standpoint of what we think those funds would need in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=781)|
| 0:13:19| And so, oftentimes, when you see these peaks on the on on the percent change of expenses. It's really us doing that from the standpoint of doing transfers to funds that we think are needing help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=799)|
| 0:13:38| Chris, what does CPI stand for?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=818)|
| 0:13:41| Consumer Price Index and so it's a measure, as you probably are well aware that the federal government uses a lot. You can look at it historically going back hundreds or 100 years and it's month over month and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=821)|
| 0:14:00| it's a lot. It's oftentimes used to try to see if your growth is keeping up with CPI because CPI is how how inflation happens and how growth happens. Any other questions on this slide before we move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=840)|
| 0:14:15| Okay, here's our property tax rate history. And so, the next few slides, we'll talk about property tax and and collections and reappraisals and things like that. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=855)|
| 0:14:28| what we wanted to show you here is in 1999, our tax rate was 277 and 2000, it went to 332. That was, we get asked this question a lot. So, that was the last property tax increase that 1999.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=868)|
| 0:14:45| And so, that's what that increase was. Then you'll see from 2001 to 2000, it went to 332. And so, that was the last property tax increase that Knox County has had. And so, it was a 55 cent increase. And you all probably know the history behind that. I don't have to get into history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=885)|
| 0:15:08| And so, that's what that increase was. Then you'll see from 2001 to 2002, it drops from 332 to 296. Does anybody want to guess why that went down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=908)|
| 0:15:22| Every four years reassessments. Good job. And so, reappraisal there. So, and then you'll see the next four years reappraisal. Again, it drops from 296 to 269. Four more years, 269 to 236. Four more years, 236 to 232. So, you may know that that was a small increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=922)|
| 0:15:52| A smaller drop as far as percentage and number. That was, you know, at the end of the housing process that happened, you know, 10, 11. So, there was some concern there that we actually made for the first time in history, see a reverse of what we normally see during reappraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=952)|
| 0:16:10| Did not happen. And so, that means that value still went up. So, our rate went down. And we'll get into that in a minute, how that works. And then you'll see at the end of 17 to 18, the rate dropped from 232 to 212. And we've been at 212 for four years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=970)|
| 0:16:29| Now, we historically have had a four-year reappraisal cycle. Assessor Whitehead asked for that to be extended for five years on the current model as they are implementing new software. And so, we will go, so we will stay on the same, that reappraisal cycle would go out to 2022.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=989)|
| 0:16:57| Reappraisal will happen. I'm assuming the rate's going to drop. We continue to see growth in property tax. So, I think rate drops. And then after that, he will come back and ask commission to go back to a four-year cycle at that point. And so, then we'll get back to our normal four-year cycle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1017)|
| 0:17:19| And so, I just wanted to show you a property tax rate history. And then let us get a little bit into reappraisal. We get asked a lot about reappraisal. And so, there's going to be, we'll watch a video here in a second after this that I can get it to play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1039)|
| 0:17:39| But the state of Tennessee mandates that Knox County Assessor to conduct reappraisals every four years. Every four, five, or six years is really what it is. Tennessee code annotated, and you can jot that down if you want to, 67-5-1601, provides for periodic reappraisal and equalization of all real property in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1059)|
| 0:18:03| Reappraisals allow the Assessor to adjust property tax values so that every property in Knox County is appraised at fair market value. A reappraisal eliminates the inequities created over time by changes in the real estate market, ensuring fairness and equity for all property owners. The last reappraisal occurred in 2018, and the next reappraisal is going to be in 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1083)|
| 0:18:28| Property owners are notified by mail of the reappraisal. So, that's a little synopsis of what reappraisal is. So, reappraisals are not allowed to increase revenue for local governments, as Tennessee certified tax rate law requires the new tax rate to be reset to raise the same amount of revenue as the previous year, except for new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1108)|
| 0:18:55| Because of recent developments, we likely have one of the lowest tax rates in Metro government history. And so, you know, we continue to go down. And so, this video will help, but just to summarize, what happens with reappraisal is it looks at everything in the aggregate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1135)|
| 0:19:19| And so, it takes the aggregate value, and as it says there, you can't increase your revenue from a reappraisal. So, if values go up 20%, rate goes down 20% in the aggregate. So, in the aggregate, it has to stay whole, but you can use new construction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1159)|
| 0:19:45| So, that part helps.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1185)|
| 0:19:49| Chris, before you start the video, I see Commissioner Smith's hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1189)|
| 0:19:56| Chris, you can go ahead and finish what you were stating. I just wanted to ask you something before we watch the video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1196)|
| 0:20:01| Sure. I was going to say, and it actually equates to you, the one place that we get hurt at on reappraisals is it relates to utilities. And so, we do get hurt there on reappraisals. The state's not changed that law. I don't know if they will change that law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1201)|
| 0:20:22| But we do get hampered there because I don't think, and Brandy can jump in here, I don't think they, I think they are excluded from reappraisals. And so, they don't have to go through that equalization phase. And so, they just get to take advantage of the lower rate, not the higher values, if that makes sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1222)|
| 0:20:44| And so, now, what happens is this, with your constituents, you know, unless your value changes, unless your home value changes by the same, by the exact same amount as the aggregate, your taxes will either go up or down, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1244)|
| 0:21:05| And so, if you live in an area that has all 40% increase in property values, and the aggregate is 20, then your property tax is going to go up. And on the flip side, if you've only saw 10% growth, your tax bill is going to go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1265)|
| 0:21:29| And so, it really looks at it in the aggregate, and sometimes that's hard for people to understand because it's not individualized. It's more on the stance of aggregate. And so, that's how that works. Are there questions before I try to play the video?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1289)|
| 0:21:54| Wish me luck here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1314)|
| 0:21:56| Commissioner Smith, did you want to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1316)|
| 0:21:57| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1317)|
| 0:21:58| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1318)|
| 0:22:01| Chris, this gets a little bit confusing at times when people look at our tax rate. And you can look at it and simply see that since 2000, when it was $3.32, at its current level of $2.12, that's a 37% reduction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1321)|
| 0:22:19| Now, when we do the aggregate, you know, the property taxes we collect today versus what we collected in 2000, do you have something with that number?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1339)|
| 0:22:35| We...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1355)|
| 0:22:36| I think you went back to 11.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1356)|
| 0:22:40| Correct. I may have backed a little further.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1360)|
| 0:22:45| What I'm trying to get at is, how much of that rate reduction is due to inflation? You know, whenever we do our aggregate, do we go back to what our aggregate was four years before? Or do we do it, you know, like they're doing it right now, where they base it off of this year's tax base, or off of what it was four years ago when it was set at the rate it was four years ago?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1365)|
| 0:23:12| Honestly, that'd be a really good question for Assessor Whitehead. He's the one that has to certify the tax rate. He knows that formula much better than I and what goes into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1392)|
| 0:23:27| I can tell you just historically speaking, in 2011, we collected about $223.6 million in current property taxes. And so, in FY19, according to this, we collected $266.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1407)|
| 0:23:50| So, $43 million increase from growth. And some of that is construction growth, as you pointed out. As far as what goes into the calculation of reappraisal, he has that and he knows that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1430)|
| 0:24:08| I know it's complex. They account for certain things and I think can account for OTH too, I'm pretty sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1448)|
| 0:24:15| Okay, I was just trying to get an idea of what percentage of it is based upon increased market values through reassessment and what component of it is due to actual growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1455)|
| 0:24:34| That's a good question. I think he probably could give you at least the last one that he did would show that and it would be a good thing to share.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1474)|
| 0:24:46| I'm going to try to share this video from the Comptroller's website so it's easy to find, but let me see if I can get this to pull up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1486)|
| 0:25:03| Larson, you did say you're sending all this to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1503)|

| 0:25:10| I'm going to try to share my screen a different way. I don't guess you all are seeing the video now, are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1510)|
| 0:25:16| Usually you have to stop sharing and then re-share if it's on a different screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1516)|

| 0:25:21| Yeah, and then you want to maximize that screen. Once you hit play, there should be like an expansion button in the bottom corner. There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1521)|

| 0:25:37| Is that better?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1537)|
| 0:25:38| Yeah, and then you want to maximize that screen. Once you hit play, there should be like an expansion button in the bottom corner. There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1538)|
| 0:25:46| Meet Steve. This is Steve's house, and this is Steve's property assessment notice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1546)|
| 0:25:53| If you own property in Tennessee, it's the job of your county assessor to figure out how much it's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1553)|
| 0:25:59| Depending on which county you're in, an updated value for your property is determined every four, five, or six years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1559)|
| 0:26:07| And since property values generally go up over time, there's a good chance that your house, commercial property, or land will be appraised at a higher value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1567)|
| 0:26:17| Steve's property has gone up in value, so what does this mean for his property taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1577)|
| 0:26:22| Here's the good news. Higher value means that your house will be appraised at a higher value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1582)|
| 0:26:28| Steve's property has gone up in value, so what does this mean for his property taxes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1588)|
| 0:26:34| Here's the good news. Higher values during a reappraisal do not necessarily mean higher taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1594)|
| 0:26:40| Tennessee law requires the state work with your assessor and county mayor to adjust your property tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1600)|
| 0:26:47| So when appraisals go up, your tax rate goes down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| It's known as the certified tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1612)|
| 0:26:55| The concept is simple.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1615)|
| 0:26:57| A new certified tax rate will generate the same amount of tax revenues for your city or county as the amount billed in the previous year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1617)|
| 0:27:05| Let's say all of the properties in Steve's community increased in value by an average of 20%.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1625)|
| 0:27:12| Steve's house also increased 20%, but thanks to the certified tax rate, he should pay just about the same amount in property tax as he paid last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1632)|
| 0:27:22| The only way the certified tax rate can be exceeded is if Steve's county commission or city council decides to hold a public hearing and adopt a new, higher rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1642)|
| 0:27:33| When you receive a new property appraisal, it helps to understand how you're protected by the certified rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1653)|
| 0:27:39| But pay attention to your local government meetings to know if leaders are thinking about exceeding it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1659)|
| 0:27:44| Remember, the assessor values your property. The county commission or city council determines how much you'll pay in taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1664)|
| 0:28:11| You're back on the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1691)|
| 0:28:13| Is that better? There we go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| Shared screen. There you go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| Commissioner Hill, did you have a question before we move forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1700)|
| 0:28:23| Yes. So just to be clear, I hear this over and over and I need to keep saying it to make sure I am communicating it correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1703)|
| 0:28:32| So even though we will have natural growth and an increase in our property values, the amount that we pay in that new value is actually adjusted down because the tax rate cannot go up. Am I saying that right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1712)|
| 0:29:00| Yeah, I think. And so I think the video does a better job than I can. Ultimately, they won't, they don't allow you in the aggregate to make money off reappraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1740)|
| 0:29:14| And so they do allow you to capture a certain amount of growth of new construction, but of the existing homes that was on the last free appraisal compared to the current free appraisal, you have to adjust the rate down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1754)|
| 0:29:29| It will allow you new construction. So that is just pulled out. But home to home, you know, what was there to what is there. Correct. You cannot, a government cannot increase its revenues off reappraisal. That's why the rate gets adjusted down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1769)|
| 0:29:50| Okay, so the only way. So even though we have all this new construction, and and of course we capture that because it is new building, but in order to actually on a level playing field, increase our revenues per se is through a tax increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1790)|
| 0:30:15| Yes, I exactly. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1815)|
| 0:30:17| All right. All right. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1817)|
| 0:30:18| What they say, even on the on the video is you've got to have a public hearing a public meeting, saying it and explicitly talking about it. And so, yeah, they, they don't allow you quote unquote to back into it through through reappraisal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1818)|
| 0:30:37| Commissioner Daly has a question and then Commissioner Smith. Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1837)|
| 0:30:41| Yeah, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chris, I want to follow up on that. We got a neighboring county that he has told me a couple of times that when they do reappraisals, they set their tax rate at a little more than what the appraisals come back. And I told him, I said, I don't think that's legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1841)|
| 0:31:01| It's not legal. And so, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1861)|
| 0:31:04| they do it. Well, I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1864)|
| 0:31:07| You have to call a tax increase. Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1867)|
| 0:31:10| I don't know if they're announcing that they're going to have a tax increase at that meeting or not, but I'm going to follow up with them just to see. But that was interesting. I noticed that on the video. That was a great video.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1870)|
| 0:31:20| And so just to give you some sort of indication, what can happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1880)|
| 0:31:27| So if, if, you know, like we go out two pennies on on the tax rate like to 12. Right. And so if if reappraisal can can can came back and it was 2.126, they would probably allow us to go to 2.13. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1887)|
| 0:31:48| But on the flip side, if it's 2.124, they're going to make they're going to make you go down to 2.12. Now you can go out for decimal spots on reappraisal. So the city goes out for we have historically just did too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1908)|
| 0:32:05| But you can go out for spots. But so you can get a little bit of growth there. But ultimately, it's going to balance itself out probably over time. But the neighboring county you're talking about if they're going up above that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1925)|
| 0:32:20| In theory, they, they're supposed to have a public hearing, as that said, and then voted in and you can't, you know, it's, you know, saying what it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1940)|
| 0:32:31| I mean, they could say, they could say it's because of of inflation or whatever. And that's okay. But they, they explicitly have to say that they're increasing the tax rate above what the reappraisal rate came back at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1951)|
| 0:32:49| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| Hey, Mr. Yeah, Chris, you kind of went to one of the points I was going to go to and that's the four digits. And, you know, I've told you that after| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1971)|
| 0:33:02| Depending on the amount of the round on the four digits after you go four cycles, four or five cycles, you can be getting close to pushing a point if it goes the wrong way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1982)|
| 0:33:13| I didn't have a question that we never had to deal with and hope to God we never have to deal with, but it is the inverse of what we're talking about with inflation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=1993)|
| 0:33:23| If we did have deflation and devaluation that happened with the reassessment. I know it's always said that it has to remain revenue neutral. Would that mean that there's a possibility that taxes could tax rate could increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2003)|
| 0:33:39| Great question. I'm going to answer both. Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2019)|
| 0:33:44| Can you unshare your screen while we'll have the discussion and then come back to that so we can all see each other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2024)|
| 0:33:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2031)|
| 0:33:53| Great question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2033)|
| 0:33:55| Yes. And so what what the what TCA code says and what the state says is simply this and we thought we may have saw that back in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2035)|
| 0:34:03| Get my notes. I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2043)|
| 0:34:05| We thought that may would have happened back in 2014 we went from 236 to 232 there was some concern because the four years being examined included the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2045)|
| 0:34:22| The bubble bursting and the housing market and all the the negative stuff that follows. There was some concern that our rate actually may go up because values went down. Right. And so, yes, you can have the inverse of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2062)|
| 0:34:38| And so, yes, you can have the inverse of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2078)|
| 0:34:42| Historically speaking for Knox County. We've never had that. We've always had growth. That's the closest that we've came. And so, but yes, rates can go up if values go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2082)|
| 0:34:56| And to your other point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2096)|
| 0:34:58| By not going out for four digits and instead of two. Right. And so let's say the next reappraisal. Let's say that rate for us comes in at 2.0049. Right. So then we would have to round down to two even. Correct. So what is that 0.0049| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2098)|
| 0:35:24| worth to us? Anyone want to take a guess?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| A couple hundred thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2128)|
| 0:35:30| I think it's probably closer to five or six hundred thousand now. And so substantial. Right. I mean, it's substantial even if it's two or three hundred thousand substantial. So, you know, we can once that reappraisal happens again, we can have the conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2130)|
| 0:35:49| Again, does it make sense to go out four decimal spots? We do what we have to pull in the assessor and the trustee just to make sure that it doesn't cause them any issues because you always round to the nearest dollar, of course, on property taxes. But ultimately, it is more precise to go out to that fourth digit. I mean, you're being more precise and you take out the rounding component.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2149)|
| 0:36:16| Is there a consensus of that? I'm sorry. Is there a consensus across the state of two digit versus four? I mean, or is it all four? It's it varies. I think more cities may use four digits than counties. This is what I recall saying. Keep in mind, it's been four years since we looked at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2176)|
| 0:36:42| Chris, if I remember correctly, and I may be wrong about this because I often am, but it seems like if you go to four, you make a commitment to round up or down regardless of how the cards lay on the table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2202)|
| 0:36:55| Correct. And so if you go to four, then you're going to be at four and it is what it is. So if you're going out four digits and your number is 2.1267, you can't ask them to go to 2.13. You're set in stone. You're correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2215)|
| 0:37:16| Commissioner Schoonmaker, Beeler, and then Hill. Schoonmaker?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2236)|
| 0:37:21| Thank you, Chairman Jay. It's interesting if you look at citizens who have been in their homes for about 15 years or longer, they're paying less in property taxes today than they did 15 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2241)|
| 0:37:36| But the unfortunate part to that is our cost of delivering services has dramatically increased. But if somebody changes their home, you know, every five or six years, they're not going to see that, you know, that they have had a property tax decrease.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2256)|
| 0:37:55| There's no floor is what you're saying, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2275)|
| 0:37:59| Yeah, I don't think there's a floor. I'm assuming you get to a certain point to where you probably do have a floor, but it's not really set in stone of what that floor is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2279)|
| 0:38:09| No, no, but I mean, I guess Commissioner Schoonmaker, what you're saying is that, like, I think we saw this in the last couple of last few articles that were really in depth on this, that somebody who may have paid $800 at one point now paying $600.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2289)|
| 0:38:23| And although everything that we provide as a service continues to go up, there's no, like, bottom floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2303)|
| 0:38:31| And then if we go through another reappraisal, they could go down and down and down and keep going down over time to a point where they're using the same level of county service, but they're paying half as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2311)|
| 0:38:43| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2323)|
| 0:38:45| Ultimately, what happens is this. And so I'm going to give you an example of where I think Commissioner Schoonmaker's example would come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2325)|
| 0:38:57| If growth, every time there was reappraisal, and the growth was 10% or 20%, if that homeowner fell below that aggregate growth amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2337)|
| 0:39:12| So if it was 20 and they were at 15, and if it was at 10 and they were at five, so they would see a decrease in their property taxes, because ultimately in the aggregate, they're staying below what the county is seeing as an average growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2352)|
| 0:39:30| That make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2370)|
| 0:39:32| Yeah, I wonder if there's a way, I don't know if it would come from the property assessor, the trustee, or from you all to get some sort of in-depth data report showing, okay, you have, I'm just making this up, you have 100,000 properties, you know, in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2372)|
| 0:39:47| And looking at a snapshot over the last 20 years and seeing where was, where were they, what were they paying before and what are they paying now and kind of trying to categorize, you know, to better understand if we have, you know, if maybe that only impacts 10% of the thing, you know, of the population, you know, just trying to better understand that data.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2387)|
| 0:40:08| Is that something that, who would pull that and who would decipher that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2408)|
| 0:40:13| Either the assessor or the trustee, and I don't know exactly, it may more be the assessor, but I'm not certain that, I think what you would hear, so if you took that argument to the state as an example, what you're going to hear, well, for every person that we can talk about that has went down in taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2413)|
| 0:40:32| they're going to point to somebody else who's went up because they're living in an area that's, that's, that's exceeding the growth that's on average. And so,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2432)|
| 0:40:41| It'd just be interesting to know that, like, just how many people are we talking about that would go up and would go down and would be in the middle of new growth? I don't think we have a concept of what new growth looks like versus something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2441)|
| 0:40:54| I think the assessor would be the one to contact because ultimately they do the reappraisal every four years. And so they could probably have a history of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2454)|
| 0:41:04| Commissioner Bealey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2464)|
| 0:41:09| Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was going to comment on Commissioner Smith's question, but I think I want to comment on Commissioner Schoonmakers too, because I think they both make great points.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2469)|
| 0:41:18| You know, obviously, in 20 years, we've not had to deal with the situation of the rate going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2478)|
| 0:41:25| And things are great right now, but, you know, having worked in the registrar's office during those years, we were probably only saved by the way the reappraisal cycled. In any one, if it had been in any one of those other three years, it probably would have gone up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2485)|
| 0:41:42| But the other point, and to Commissioner Schoonmakers point, you know, when you only raise revenues through growth, which is obviously if there's no tax increases, that's what you're doing, essentially.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2502)|
| 0:41:58| Theoretically, and this may not be actuality, but theoretically, when you do that, you're only increasing revenue in proportion to the number of people that your service is increasing to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2518)|
| 0:42:14| You're not really taking into consideration new services that may be required, more expensive services, as Commissioner Schoonmaker pointed out, or higher quality of service, you know, expectation-wise, that may happen as technology increases and as time goes on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2534)|
| 0:42:30| So growth's a great way to increase revenues, but it may not always increase them in proportion to what's expected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2550)|
| 0:42:43| Commissioner Hill, I think you had your hand up next, and then we'll circle back to Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2563)|
| 0:42:48| Thank you. So to your point, Commissioner Wheeler, all the growth in the world isn't, doesn't really, especially if our growth tends to be more residential, where the services run a little higher, I believe, than, you know, a large commercial piece,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2568)|
| 0:43:09| then that doesn't even really allow us to maintain, because we still have improvements that need to be made just to stay neutral, just to stay even. Roads, you know, and that type of thing still need attention.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2589)|
| 0:43:28| Going back, Chris, to what you were saying, though, about the taking it out four places instead of two, and if, Randy, I think you said if we commit to do that, we have to stay with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2608)|
| 0:43:45| However, how is that a lose? I mean, it either stays the same or it goes up if it has to hit that 5.0 or, you know, but yeah, 0.50.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2625)|
| 0:44:02| Yeah, I don't think so. I think going out four spots is more exact. I think what Commissioner Smith was saying is that if next year we were at point, you know, we were, let's say, $2, 2.0055, and we asked to go to 2.51, 2.01, they would allow us to do that, but you're missing that if you go out to four.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2642)|
| 0:44:30| And he would be the first to tell you, you know, it's a, it's risk reward, right? So, ultimately, if it was 2.0049, they'd make you go down. And so, but you're just missing that upside if you still just go out two decimal spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2670)|
| 0:44:49| Is that a voting matter?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2689)|
| 0:44:52| Well, basically, when you all recertify the tax rate, I think at that point, it comes to you all. And then you all normally recertify in August, I believe. I think it's August or September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2692)|
| 0:45:07| And so, at that point, whatever the assessor brings, you all can talk about, okay, if it's, if he brings it going out two decimal spots, and you want to say, hey, what is it going out for, then you could look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2707)|
| 0:45:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2728)|
| 0:45:32| Commissioner Smith, did you have something else on this topic before we move on?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2732)|
| 0:45:36| Yes, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2736)|
| 0:45:39| First, I'd like to point out that in a scenario where someone's taxes are decreasing, the way we do this by the aggregate, that also means that this person's home value is not appreciating as fast as the rest of Knox County's homeowners or the people that do go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2739)|
| 0:45:55| That is why their taxes go down. It's a relevant figure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2755)|
| 0:45:59| Also, we're talking about growth property taxes, and I may, Chris, correct me if I'm wrong, but we are actually a sales tax generated revenue type of government entity. The bulk of our revenue comes from sales tax, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2759)|
| 0:46:18| No, we get the bulk, we get bulk, we get more from property tax than sales tax, but both are substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2778)|
| 0:46:26| They're pretty substantial. What is the division of that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2786)|
| 0:46:32| So, as an example, we collected in FY20 almost $270 million in property tax, and I think in sales tax it's like $170 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2792)|
| 0:46:43| Okay, but that's not factoring in the state and the state's contribution to our education system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2803)|
| 0:46:48| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2808)|
| 0:46:49| We're looking at the overall, and so when somebody moves here and they pay their property tax, a lot of what we're really trying to capture is their sales tax to some degree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2809)|
| 0:47:06| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| If I could, just one more. Is the, and I don't know much about this, is the freeze that occurs for our seniors if they're below a certain income guideline, does that affect us greatly with our population aging?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2828)|
| 0:47:26| It handles the property tax freeze, it's based off a certain age and a certain, I think, wage demographic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2846)|
| 0:47:40| I don't know the impact that that has on us, and it's not that the state actually has to approve it every so often, it's really done more at the state level than here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2860)|
| 0:47:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| I'm not seeing any more questions, so Chris, I think you can reshare and pick up on the next slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2876)|
| 0:48:01| What you have here is, left-hand side is property tax collections in dollars, and the right side would be property tax rate, and so the orange line is the tax rate, and the blue boxes are current property tax collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2881)|
| 0:48:26| As you can see there, healthy growth in property tax collections year over year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2906)|
| 0:48:33| As mentioned before, property taxes from FY11, which was $230.9 million, to FY20 was $269.5, so substantial growth right at $40 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2913)|
| 0:48:50| As we talked about, that's just in growth, and so we do and are fortunate enough to have substantial growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2930)|
| 0:48:59| Most counties don't see the growth in property tax that we see, and take that one step further, we often talk about a penny on the tax rate as we talk about what that's worth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2939)|
| 0:49:16| What you see on the left-hand side is what a penny is valued at, and then what you see on the right-hand side is the tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2956)|
| 0:49:27| The orange line, again, is the tax rate, the blue box is the penny, what one penny is worth, and so as you can see, we are currently just under $1.3 million per penny.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2967)|
| 0:49:43| It's actually $1,274,000 per penny, and so that's substantial as well, and that helps us, of course, to bring in revenue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2983)|
| 0:49:54| We actually did not put any type of growth into property tax as we did the budget for FY21, as we had conversations with the state, but on the report that we sent out, the monthly financial update,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=2994)|
| 0:50:11| I would point out that to date, let me get to it, to date, I think we were about 5% ahead, excuse me, 6% ahead on current collections through December than what our five-year average is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3011)|
| 0:50:28| Our five-year average was about 51%, and we're at 57%, and so we have saw really, really increased ability to pull out payments for property tax for the first few months of this fiscal year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3028)|
| 0:50:53| and so we for sure, if that continues, will beat what we had budgeted per penny on property tax, and it's not a bad place to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3053)|
| 0:51:09| It could be the alternative, and we would be hitting those numbers, and then we'd be in a bad spot, so it really isn't a bad spot to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3069)|
| 0:51:18| It's just, as we talked about budget back six, well, actually eight months ago now or whatever or so, we had a lot of conversations with the state about what was going to happen, property tax, sales tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3078)|
| 0:51:36| and we try to follow their lead, and we really, besides a couple of months, not saw a drop off, and so that's not a bad thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3096)|
| 0:51:47| It's a positive thing, and it's something that we continue just to be amazed by, and so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3107)|
| 0:51:55| Chris, before you move on, I see a hand up from Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3115)|
| 0:52:02| He can finish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3122)|
| 0:52:03| I just want to ask him a question before we leave property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3123)|
| 0:52:06| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3126)|
| 0:52:08| Chris, do you have like a pie graph that breaks down where our $2.12 percent of property tax goes so that everybody has a good understanding of what property tax funds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3128)|
| 0:52:20| Yeah, if you actually go into the monthly financial update that was sent out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3140)|
| 0:52:25| Yeah, that was attached to the invitation list of monthly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3145)|
| 0:52:29| Randy, there's actually how it's divided up with a dollar on there, which is pretty nifty, and so it shows by the pennies how it's distributed out, so that's pretty interesting because it shows you actually by a dollar bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3149)|
| 0:52:45| I don't think that Jennifer actually took a dollar bill and cut it up, but it was kind of something that she found.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3165)|
| 0:52:54| It looks like it's on page 10 of that document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3174)|
| 0:53:00| It's 42% general fund, 38% general purpose school fund, 20% debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3180)|
| 0:53:09| So 42 general fund, 38 general purpose, and 20% debt service, and then the breakdown is essentially $2.12.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3189)|
| 0:53:18| It's 89 cents goes to the general fund, 80 cents goes to schools, and 43 cents goes to debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3198)|
| 0:53:31| Chris, I had a question. Does this graph that you're showing, does it tell you anything that we're leveling off in the last essentially three years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3211)|
| 0:53:40| No, I think what makes it look that way is what we have on there for 20 and 21 are budgeted numbers and not actual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3220)|
| 0:53:51| And so if you have actual, you see more of a trajectory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3231)|
| 0:54:00| I'm trying to think what I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3240)|
| 0:54:03| And so that's more of looking at it from a budget standpoint.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3243)|
| 0:54:08| Okay. I'm not seeing any other hands up, so if you want to continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3248)|
| 0:54:15| So we looked at property tax rate for us compared to some of the bigger counties and we threw in there severe as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3255)|
| 0:54:24| And so you can see this is just the county tax rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3264)|
| 0:54:30| And so, as you know, in Davidson, they've got some urbanized districts and we of course have the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3270)|
| 0:54:38| Hamilton has some as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3278)|
| 0:54:40| They were kind of varied, so we thought about putting just the county and then one that's combined, but it was kind of varied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3280)|
| 0:54:47| So what we thought we'd look at is just the county tax rate and where we set among those counties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3287)|
| 0:54:57| I think, of course, we're at 212. I think Rutherford was at about, I'll just go through them here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3297)|
| 0:55:06| Shelby's at 405. Davidson in the general service area is at 379.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3306)|
| 0:55:13| Hamilton is 277. Williamson County is 222. Rutherford County is 222.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3313)|
| 0:55:21| We, of course, are at 212 and Sevier's at 186.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3321)|
| 0:55:25| I'm going to move on to sales tax now, if that's OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3325)|
| 0:55:41| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3341)|
| 0:55:45| Yeah, before we move on to sales tax, looking at this property tax graph bar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3345)|
| 0:55:51| I am a bit curious as to what Davidson and Shelby and Knox and Hamilton compare to us when you add city taxes on top of the county taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3351)|
| 0:56:04| We live in an area where roughly 40 percent of our people that live in the county are also city taxpayers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3364)|
| 0:56:12| Do you remember offhand what that looked like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3372)|
| 0:56:16| We got it from the state website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3376)|
| 0:56:19| What I'll do is we'll just do a little, give you like an estimate on each one about how much it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3379)|
| 0:56:25| It's going to vary about where they are. And so we can send that out in an email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3385)|
| 0:56:31| It'd be really good to see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3391)|
| 0:56:41| Looking at sales tax now and you can kind of see what this is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3401)|
| 0:56:46| And so you see that 12, 13 and 14 was pretty flat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3406)|
| 0:56:56| But from from 11 to 20, we've increased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3416)|
| 0:57:05| About 50 million dollars in sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3425)|
| 0:57:09| We're trending right now in FY 21 of hitting probably above 190.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3429)|
| 0:57:16| We had 179.4 in FY 20. And so thus far in 21, if we continue the trend we're on, we'll probably break 190.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3436)|
| 0:57:27| But, you know, sales tax is volatile. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3447)|
| 0:57:32| And so we talked about that in the past. And so you can go back to eight or nine when we drop 10, 10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3452)|
| 0:57:39| So it happens. But since FY 13, we've kind of been on an upward type of trajectory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3459)|
| 0:57:51| There's no doubt that we were helped by the change in the law related to Internet sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3471)|
| 0:58:02| And so and so that helped as we finished out FY 20 and got into 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3482)|
| 0:58:10| And so we think that that is positive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3490)|
| 0:58:17| Looking at this, what you have here is sales tax collections by the counties that we talked about as it was related to property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3497)|
| 0:58:28| looking at it from a sales tax perspective. And on the bottom, you can see there, as you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3508)|
| 0:58:35| there is an option on a half a penny on the sales tax that you can take advantage of via referendum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3515)|
| 0:58:42| And so you can see that Davidson, of course, is leads the state in sales tax collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3522)|
| 0:58:51| Shelby is behind them. There's some space between those two and us and we're third.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3531)|
| 0:58:58| And then you can kind of see Williamson's have had the biggest growth since FY 18. Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3538)|
| 0:59:05| So you can see Williamson's basically caught Hamilton and and Rutherford.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3545)|
| 0:59:12| And then you see the bottom line there being severe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3552)|
| 0:59:16| Then on the very bottom there, we put what those tax rates were, the local option rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3556)|
| 0:59:22| So Davidson is still two and a quarter. Hamilton's at two and a quarter. We're at two and a quarter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3562)|
| 0:59:29| Rutherford's severe. Shelby and Williamson's at two, seven, five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3569)|
| 0:59:33| And so basically you have almost an even split there, too, as to where people are, where those communities are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3573)|
| 0:59:45| And. We will get asked, and I assume this question was coming, so I thought I came prepared.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3585)|
| 0:59:59| What's the half penny worth for Knox County? Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| And so. We base this off of collections for 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3603)|
| 1:00:14| OK, and then we use what the normal percentage breakdown is between Knox County, city of Knoxville and Farragut.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3614)|
| 1:00:25| And so just so you are aware, city of Knoxville accounts for like 67.25 percent of sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3625)|
| 1:00:35| And Knox County's at 26.44. Farragut's at 6.29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3635)|
| 1:00:42| And the remaining 0.02 is actually Zoo Knoxville. But can you repeat that real quick?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3642)|
| 1:00:48| Sure. City of Knoxville, just on average, accounts for 67.25 percent of local option sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3648)|
| 1:01:00| Knox County accounts for 26.44 percent. Farragut's at 6.29 and Zoo Knoxville's at 0.02.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3660)|
| 1:01:16| And so. That half penny, we estimate to be worth, based off FY20 numbers, about 38 million dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3676)|
| 1:01:32| Just to be clear, so if we if our local was 2.75 instead of 2.25, we would have plus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3692)|
| 1:01:41| Thirty eight million dollars. So here's the kicker to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| OK, so that the reason I gave you the percentage is very important. So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3705)|
| 1:01:52| Half of that by state law must go to schools. Right. And so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3712)|
| 1:01:59| The amount that the city of Knoxville would get of the thirty eight million is twenty five million five hundred and fifty five thousand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3719)|
| 1:02:14| And of which. Twelve million seven seventy seven five hundred would go to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3734)|
| 1:02:27| Knox County's piece would be ten million forty seven thousand two hundred dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3747)|
| 1:02:35| Of course, half of that would go to schools, which is five million twenty three thousand six hundred dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3755)|
| 1:02:44| Farragut's piece of the half penny would be two million three hundred ninety thousand two hundred dollars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3764)|
| 1:02:52| Half of that to schools is one million one ninety five one hundred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3772)|
| 1:02:57| So. Eighteen million nine ninety six. Eighteen million nine hundred ninety six thousand two hundred dollars would be directed towards schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3777)|
| 1:03:14| The city of Knoxville would get the second highest piece of the twelve million with the twelve point seven million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3794)|
| 1:03:22| Knox County would get the five million that we discussed and Farragut would get one point right at one point two.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3802)|
| 1:03:32| And so. That's the half penny. And so what happens?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3812)|
| 1:03:38| So how does that what happens with that half penny?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3818)|
| 1:03:41| So my understanding that if that ever happens, it's a referendum on the ballot that would have to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3821)|
| 1:03:51| The city, the town of Farragut and Knox County to impact all three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3831)|
| 1:03:58| Because it could be where it passes one and not the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3838)|
| 1:04:04| And then you just have differing tax rates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3844)|
| 1:04:15| Thanks for the clarification. Commissioner Daly, I see your hand up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3855)|
| 1:04:20| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3860)|
| 1:04:23| What is the city's tax rates? Because I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3863)|
| 1:04:28| Can you break it down? Is it that they get this two point two seven five or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3868)|
| 1:04:35| They get two and a quarter. So it's two point two five. It's the same as ours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3875)|
| 1:04:41| So their local piece is two point two five. Now, what the city does, as does Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3881)|
| 1:04:48| And it's because of referendums back in the 60s. They we end up giving as well as the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3888)|
| 1:04:55| Seventy two point two to eight percent of sales tax collections to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3895)|
| 1:05:03| OK. I had another question, but I forgot it. So if I think of it, I'll put it in the chat box. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3903)|
| 1:05:10| Ask again. It's OK. I like it to be informal. And so I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3910)|
| 1:05:18| So, you know, we've talked about this before. So city of Knoxville, Knox County, back in the 60s,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3918)|
| 1:05:25| there was a referendum on on the ballot for a penny of local option sales tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3925)|
| 1:05:30| That first penny for both went to education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3930)|
| 1:05:34| And so there have been two referendums since both.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3934)|
| 1:05:39| I think one's half a penny and then one point seven five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3939)|
| 1:05:45| They have them toward schools and then general fund on the city and the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3945)|
| 1:05:50| So you get into into fractions and I'm sure you all love fractions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3950)|
| 1:05:55| And so you eventually get to 13 eighteenths of a penny. And when you do the fractions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3955)|
| 1:06:01| that's how you get to the seventy two point two to eight percent. Richie loves to do fractions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3961)|
| 1:06:07| And so I'm surprised he didn't know that and chime right in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3967)|
| 1:06:12| Hey, Chris, I just remembered the that extra high scene at the state could take that at any time if they wanted to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3972)|
| 1:06:18| Is that correct? Sure. I mean, ultimately, you know, I guess if you're the state that's on the table, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3978)|
| 1:06:27| they've not had a bad fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3987)|
| 1:06:31| I mean, technically, I guess, as I was budgeting for twenty twenty one last year in the session,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=3991)|
| 1:06:41| they like most had kind of a dark scenario. They didn't try to get it then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4001)|
| 1:06:48| But to your point, yes, ultimately, if it's on the table, it could be there for them to get.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4008)|
| 1:07:00| Mr. Chairman, I had a follow up question to Commissioner Day Daily's question when he said that it made me wonder something in my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4020)|
| 1:07:10| So I'm assuming that the cap in the state is capped out in places like Sevier, Shelby and Williamson's and Rutherford's,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4030)|
| 1:07:20| that at the two point seven five, that that half a cent's not there laying in the margin for the state to take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4040)|
| 1:07:27| So are you saying the state could come take a half from us and couldn't do anything to them?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4047)|
| 1:07:34| I guess potentially I'm not. I'm not an expert, but I'm assuming they could make the rate the same across the board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4054)|
| 1:07:45| And if it's there, they could take it, I guess. I've never I've never asked that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4065)|
| 1:07:50| That question of the state. So I can't tell you that I know that for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4070)|
| 1:07:55| I will say this when the state a few years ago passed the gasoline tax, I think in that gasoline tax bill,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4075)|
| 1:08:06| I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that it allows you to add another penny on local option sales tax if it's for infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4086)|
| 1:08:16| Right. So if it's for roads. So I think it actually allows you to go up to ten point seven five percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4096)|
| 1:08:23| I think Randy was shaking his head. So I think I remember reading that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4103)|
| 1:08:27| I don't know of anybody who's taken advantage of that. I think when Nashville had the conversation or Davidson had the conversation about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4107)|
| 1:08:36| you know, the underground rail system and in in the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4116)|
| 1:08:43| I think they were contemplating that as a revenue source, but that didn't pass the voter. So it never happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4123)|
| 1:08:52| Commissioner Daly, I see your hand up again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4132)|
| 1:08:58| I'm sorry, Chairman. I'll take it down. I just want to make sure we got everybody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4138)|
| 1:09:05| All right. Other hands on this. I think you're clear to keep going, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4145)|
| 1:09:11| We're going to talk about engineering now. What you have here is just similar to that first general page, that general fund slide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4151)|
| 1:09:20| The amounts on the left, the percentages on the right, revenues in blue, expenses are in orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4160)|
| 1:09:27| And so you can kind of see there that revenue growth has been there for engineering.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4167)|
| 1:09:36| And get to my slide here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4176)|
| 1:09:44| The last few years, FY 16, they saw about a 5.6 percent increase in revenue, 17, 1.3, 18, 3.8 and 19, 2.9 and 20 was 1.9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4184)|
| 1:09:59| And so similar on the next page. What you see here is what we saw before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4199)|
| 1:10:07| Not compared to CPI, but you can see the revenue and the expenses are kind of parallel there as far as those linear lines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4207)|
| 1:10:20| And one thing that engineering does do is there's a transfer from engineering to solid waste.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4220)|
| 1:10:26| So that's kind of a built in expense. And so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4226)|
| 1:10:34| And the reason we're showing engineering in a minute, you'll see more gasoline tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4234)|
| 1:10:39| So it's a big it's a big revenue. It's the biggest piece of revenue for engineering and public works fund.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4239)|
| 1:10:48| You can see that growth in 18, 19 and 20. 20 kind of capped off was at the end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4248)|
| 1:10:59| If you remember in April, there was a safer home water by the governor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4259)|
| 1:11:04| So gasoline tax went down. So we were really humming along through February and then it kind of peaked back off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4264)|
| 1:11:13| They really expected a big downturn in gasoline tax for FY 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4273)|
| 1:11:18| They actually told us to budget a 20 percent decrease. We budgeted about 15 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4278)|
| 1:11:26| To date, we've only saw about a seven percent decrease. So that's trending in the right direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4286)|
| 1:11:30| This slide here is more what I wanted to focus on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4290)|
| 1:11:34| So what you have in the kind of the teal colored boxes is the gasoline tax collections.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4294)|
| 1:11:41| The upper line is price per ton of paving and the bottom line is miles of roads paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4301)|
| 1:11:47| So we thought we'd talk a lot about paving and what goes into the paving and where all that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4307)|
| 1:11:55| What you can kind of see there is there's a little bit of a core correlation between gasoline tax and the price per ton of asphalt versus what actually gets paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4315)|
| 1:12:06| And so you can see there was a drop off from 19 to 20 in miles paved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4326)|
| 1:12:14| Part of that was because we put a spending freeze in and we just put a kind of a freeze on paving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4334)|
| 1:12:21| You'll see in a coming slide that we're reinvesting that money in FY 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4341)|
| 1:12:28| And if you average 20 and 21 out, you would get much closer to the number of 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4348)|
| 1:12:35| I'm actually a little bit above 19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4355)|
| 1:12:38| But I think this slide is important because there's no doubt that price per ton has an impact on the amount of roads that Snowden's crews get to pave.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4358)|
| 1:12:57| You will note and remember that he got a pavement management system this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4377)|
| 1:13:06| They were actually reviewing stuff today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4386)|
| 1:13:10| The overall condition index of our roads in Knox County came out to be a 73.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4390)|
| 1:13:19| Jim says that a 73 is better than most.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4399)|
| 1:13:23| He was very happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4403)|
| 1:13:25| Is that a 73 out of 100?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4405)|
| 1:13:28| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4408)|
| 1:13:29| And so where a lot of our bad roads ended up being were like dead end roads that aren't traveled a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4409)|
| 1:13:38| They got like in the 30 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4418)|
| 1:13:40| And so people don't travel so they don't call and complain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4420)|
| 1:13:43| The other roads were in fairly good shape.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4423)|
| 1:13:47| And so he was telling me today that we currently with the use of state aid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4427)|
| 1:14:04| Thank you, Jennifer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4444)|
| 1:14:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4445)|
| 1:14:06| With state aid, we spend about six million dollars a year on repaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4446)|
| 1:14:16| He says that his goal would be we'd like to get that number closer to eight to nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4456)|
| 1:14:22| He thinks seven to eight would keep our index about the same at 73.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4462)|
| 1:14:28| Eight to nine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4468)|
| 1:14:29| You could make some improvements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4469)|
| 1:14:33| And so that's something that will work with Jim on as we work with his budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4473)|
| 1:14:39| But ultimately, 73 was a good number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4479)|
| 1:14:43| The company that came in and did the analysis said that it was something that we should be happy with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4483)|
| 1:14:53| They've given us some ideas about putting 10 percent of our budget into preventative maintenance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4493)|
| 1:15:00| And it helps to extend the life of the road, which makes sense, which oftentimes helps your overall OCI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4500)|
| 1:15:08| And so ultimately, what Jim will have here soon is a list of roads and jobs that are going to be paid based off the pavement management system and based off OCI.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4508)|
| 1:15:22| Before I call on Commissioner Smith, I just add one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| I had a meeting with engineering and public works to Jim and the team in the fall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4524)|
| 1:15:30| And we often talk about how fast our community is growing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4530)|
| 1:15:34| And this is a great chart to really point out one thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4534)|
| 1:15:37| We have about 2,000 centerline miles of road that Knox County owns and maintains.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4537)|
| 1:15:42| And, you know, when I asked, I said just to sort of, based on the life of the road, the use, all the variables that go into it, you know, what amount should we be paving every year just to kind of keep up with baseline maintenance and improve, you know, just condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4542)|
| 1:15:58| And he said about 10 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4558)|
| 1:16:00| Well, that's 200.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4560)|
| 1:16:03| At our peak, we've only ever done 50-60.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4563)|
| 1:16:07| In this chart, it looks like 50 was about our peak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4567)|
| 1:16:10| So every year, and this is something I think Commissioner Buster brings up quite often when we talk about zoning, is every year, every month, when we add more and more and more and more roads to our inventory, the gap of what we're doing to just keep up with the basics| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4570)|
| 1:16:27| and what we really need to be doing to get ahead of a growing community is growing every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4587)|
| 1:16:33| And so I would argue as we look at this, while Jim has a goal of moving us from essentially a C to a B, we really ought to be figuring out how to go from a C to an A so we can keep up with the long-term growth.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4593)|
| 1:16:45| Otherwise, we're really, you know, we're getting into a huge pinch down the road and that growth, that gap is going to grow exponentially as we grow as a county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4605)|
| 1:16:56| So, Commissioner Smith, you have your hand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4616)|
| 1:17:01| Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4621)|
| 1:17:03| Chris, going back to the revenue and expenses engineering graph that you had,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4623)|
| 1:17:11| I'm curious that that doesn't include debt service, does it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4631)|
| 1:17:15| It does not, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4635)|
| 1:17:21| We haven't even gotten to the fun topic of debt yet. It's coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4641)|
| 1:17:28| The next slide is basically just two metrics of data that was on that one slide, just looking at price per ton versus miles paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4648)|
| 1:17:39| The difference in this one is we did include FY21, and you can see a little bit of a decrease in price per ton,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4659)|
| 1:17:50| and then more of like a V from 20 to 21 and paving from the standpoint of getting to take some of that money that we didn't spend in 20 and spending it in 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4670)|
| 1:18:08| Comment on that, something that I was told a few years back, and that is the price per ton of asphalt has nothing to do with the price of gasoline or oil.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4688)|
| 1:18:19| It's a byproduct of the production, and the price is more relevant based upon the amount of production and available product to make asphalt with, which was something I thought kind of interesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4699)|
| 1:18:32| Commissioner Daley?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4712)|
| 1:18:36| Thank you, Mr. Chair. Chris?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4716)|
| 1:18:39| When we do our contracts, I probably asked Jim this, but I don't remember. Are we locked in from the fiscal 2021 price, or does it fluctuate on the cost of the asphalt?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4719)|
| 1:18:51| He would know better than I. I think it's locked in, but there could be a floater. I don't know how that works. Check with him. He'll know that better than I.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4731)|
| 1:19:05| I know that we don't hedge or pre-buy. I do know that, but I don't know what our contract links are. That's an interesting question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4745)|
| 1:19:14| I don't see any other hands up, Chris, if you want to continue on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| Getting into debt, what we have here is a look at debt from FY11 to FY20, and so what you have in the blue bars is total debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4760)|
| 1:19:35| The orange line is debt service expenses, and then just a linear look on the dotted line of where our debt service was versus where it's heading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4775)|
| 1:19:48| What you see is basically, in FY20, we spent about $73 million on debt service expenses just to service the debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4788)|
| 1:20:08| What you have seen from FY11 to FY20 is a little bit of a concerted effort to get our total debt down. You'll see two little peaks there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4808)|
| 1:20:24| One in 17. The growth in 17 were because of the construction of Hardin Valley and Gibbs Middle School. Those totaled about $70 million, and so that leaves that to be a little spike there in total debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4824)|
| 1:20:46| Chris, one thing to point out in this, because you and I had this discussion earlier, is although when you look at a lot of the revenue slides, we're looking at general fund, but we're not looking at schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4846)|
| 1:20:59| When we're looking at debt, we're looking at everything, because the school's debt is our debt. We're all in the same bucket there, so I want to make sure everybody understands that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4859)|
| 1:21:10| The front half of this presentation was all about what directly impacts Knox County that doesn't flow through the schools, but this slide shows everything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4870)|
| 1:21:17| This is the total debt service for all of Knox County, including Knox County Schools. The state makes us report all of the debt, and so in theory, all debt is Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4877)|
| 1:21:34| It looks really funny when we go to an S&P. That wasn't me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4894)|
| 1:21:46| We get all of the debt, but none of the assets, so it's kind of a weird gauge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4906)|
| 1:21:54| You'll see then 18 drops way down, and then 19 kind of pops back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4914)|
| 1:22:01| The reason for that is we weighted and issued both bond issues for 18 and 19, so that really would be more leveled out if we would have issued an 18 and issued a 19, but we combined two issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4921)|
| 1:22:21| As you are well aware, we're doing Lonsdale, Adrian Burnett, and a new Northwest Elementary School. Those will be reflected in FY21 and 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4941)|
| 1:22:35| What you have here is we think we'll continue to see debt service expenses around $70 million to $75 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4955)|
| 1:22:47| We feel those are manageable. It's less than 10 percent of our total budget, so it's not a terrible spot to be in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4967)|
| 1:22:57| Now, of course, would we like it to be lower? Of course, everybody would, but you've got to measure out what you want to do versus what money that you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4977)|
| 1:23:14| On the flip side of that, money is really cheap right now, so taking advantage of money that's cheap helps us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=4994)|
| 1:23:29| We always get a premium on our bonds, and so that coupled with a really low interest rate enables us to do a lot more projects than we could when interest rates are 4 and 5 percent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5009)|
| 1:23:45| Debt per capita, this is something that always gets talked about a little bit. These are in order, debt per capita.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5025)|
| 1:23:57| What you have, and I'm just going to focus on FY19. Davidson's debt per capita is right at $9,400.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5037)|
| 1:24:11| Hamilton, that's not in order, but Williamson County is at $3,618. Rutherford's at $1,766. We are at $1,568.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5051)|
| 1:24:29| Sevier's at $1,316. Shelby is at $1,046, and then Hamilton is at $1,034, and so we fall about right in the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5069)|
| 1:24:46| I know that Shelby County has made a concerted effort in the last four or five years to really pay down their debt service, and so you see there that their debt per capita has gotten to be in a better spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5086)|
| 1:25:04| Davidson's, of course, is really just higher than anybody else's, and so I'll ask you all a couple of questions just to see if anybody wants to guess. Does anybody want to guess what the state of Tennessee's debt per capita is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5104)|
| 1:25:35| I'm seeing no guesses. $10,000. $882, and so the state, you know, don't really issue debt for road projects, and so they don't really have a lot of debt, and so a lot of that would probably be pension debt, I guess, and so that's where that comes from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5135)|
| 1:25:55| That's where that comes from. Now, here's your better one. What do you think the U.S. debt per capita is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5155)|
| 1:26:01| $3 trillion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5161)|
| 1:26:04| About $45,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5164)|
| 1:26:07| The one I found today said $69,000. Now, you can probably find some others that say some different things, but $69,000 was the one that I found today off a website that I thought that was relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5167)|
| 1:26:23| Chris, tell us again what ours is. Knox County?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5183)|
| 1:26:27| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5187)|
| 1:26:31| $1,568.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5191)|
| 1:26:35| I think you should update that national number at each month at the work session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5195)|
| 1:26:42| Richie, why do you want to put bad work on me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5202)|
| 1:26:47| We'll expect a check from each of you for $1,568 at the next meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5207)|
| 1:26:51| Yes. Chairman, my apologies, but I do have a 430 meeting I have to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5211)|
| 1:26:55| All right. Thank you. All right, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5215)|
| 1:26:58| Final slide that I have. I thought you all would like this slide. Total debt comparison. Davidson County, if you must know, is at $5.8 billion in total debt, and so you kind of see there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5218)|
| 1:27:16| Shelby County is at $970,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5236)|
| 1:27:21| We are at $677,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| Williamson's at $662,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5245)|
| 1:27:29| We think they probably passed us in FY20, just so you know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5249)|
| 1:27:35| And Sevier's at $118 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5255)|
| 1:27:39| So it's funny, if you're Sevier, you're at $118 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5259)|
| 1:27:47| I lost my debt per capita number, but they were at a fairly high debt per capita number because their population, of course, is lower.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5267)|
| 1:27:55| You know, Chris, this is the current debt, bonded debt on the books. This isn't the obligation of what it would cost us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5275)|
| 1:28:03| If you were to pay everything off today, then it would be this amount, but what it will cost us over time is a whole different number, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5283)|
| 1:28:10| This is just looking at principal only.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5290)|
| 1:28:14| Do you have any idea what the number is of the principal for interest? I mean, our debt is over a billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5294)|
| 1:28:20| It's actually under that a little bit now. We're probably around $950,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5300)|
| 1:28:27| Interest rate's really low now, so it helps us on some of our variable rate debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5307)|
| 1:28:33| And so, you know, ultimately, you know, the things that I look at on total debt,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5313)|
| 1:28:47| Shelby and FY16 was at $1.1 billion. At the end of 2019, they were down to $970 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5327)|
| 1:28:58| And so they've made a concerted effort to kind of pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5338)|
| 1:29:04| Davidson's went from $4.9 billion to $5.8 billion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5344)|
| 1:29:12| Williamson's went from $517 million to $663 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5352)|
| 1:29:20| So that's just as an example. I mean, in Rutherford County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5360)|
| 1:29:24| And Rutherford County may be the fastest growing county in the state, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5364)|
| 1:29:28| It was at $332.16 and it was at $464.19.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5368)|
| 1:29:34| And so, just some things there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5374)|
| 1:29:40| Well, I'll answer anything that you have. That concludes my presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| And I'm sure you're bored to tears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5385)|
| 1:29:48| No, it's actually been really good dialogue. I think a lot of good questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5388)|
| 1:29:52| Commissioner Skinmaker, you're up first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5392)|
| 1:29:55| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5395)|
| 1:29:57| Chris, you and I have talked about Davidson County and their debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5397)|
| 1:30:01| And by June 30th of this year, they were supposed to pay about $250 million towards their debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5401)|
| 1:30:09| Do you know if they're making their payments on time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5409)|
| 1:30:12| The Comptroller was very concerned about their financial status.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5412)|
| 1:30:18| Yeah, you know, the Comptroller, before pandemic and before the tornadoes and all that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5418)|
| 1:30:25| had went and talked to their council and made a presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5425)|
| 1:30:31| I've not heard anything else about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5431)|
| 1:30:34| I know, of course, they went through and had a 33% property tax increase, I believe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5434)|
| 1:30:40| And so, I'm assuming that they're making their debt service payments, but I've not heard anything official on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5440)|
| 1:30:49| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| Commissioner Bussler, I think you're up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5454)|
| 1:30:57| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5457)|
| 1:30:58| Some time ago, Chris, I had made this comment about that additional sales tax that was laying on the table that the state could take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5458)|
| 1:31:06| And I said, why don't you think about doing a SPOC tax, which is Special Optional Sales Tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5466)|
| 1:31:14| that you could especially sound it to paying of debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5474)|
| 1:31:18| And I just made that statement, and everybody jumped on me that I was trying to raise taxes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5478)|
| 1:31:23| But if we leave it there on the table, they can, the state can take it, and they can take it right out of our account in that money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5483)|
| 1:31:30| So, anyway, if you did pass a sales going up to 2.75, and you made it a SPOC tax, Special Optional Sales Tax,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5490)|
| 1:31:43| to go to pay against certain debts, but it's only a limited time only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5503)|
| 1:31:48| and then you have to redirect it to other debt service that we have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5508)|
| 1:31:53| wouldn't that be a better option than just laying it on the table and the state being able to take it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5513)|
| 1:32:04| I think, so, the county's piece of the local option sales tax was, I think I said, was about $10 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5524)|
| 1:32:17| I think even with a SPOC tax, you would still have to give half of it to schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5537)|
| 1:32:23| I think the first half has to go to education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5543)|
| 1:32:27| So that would only leave five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5547)|
| 1:32:30| If you're doing a SPOC tax, you could dedicate it toward debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5550)|
| 1:32:44| I'm assuming a SPOC tax would be, I've never really researched SPOC tax as much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5564)|
| 1:32:51| I'm assuming that it would be the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5571)|
| 1:32:53| You'd have to go before the voters and get approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5573)|
| 1:32:57| And so, I guess the difference is you would be putting a sunset on it rather than it going into perpetuity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5577)|
| 1:33:09| Well, that's the major part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5589)|
| 1:33:11| See, like you went to Fulton County in Georgia, they redid just about every school on that SPOC tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5591)|
| 1:33:22| But it is a limited time, and you have to reapportion it every time that you use it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| And that way, it just doesn't go into the general fund and goes for where it wants to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5606)|
| 1:33:31| It's to pay down the debt on the debt service we do have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5611)|
| 1:33:36| Or we could just leave it there on the table, and if the state takes it, we still lose the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5616)|
| 1:33:42| It still goes, you know, we still have to pay it here in this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5622)|
| 1:33:46| And I was just wondering, it kind of gets kind of scary that they can come in and pull it and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5626)|
| 1:33:51| OK, we'll just take it out of the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5631)|
| 1:33:55| So.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5635)|
| 1:33:57| Good comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5637)|
| 1:34:02| Commissioner Daly, you were up next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5642)|
| 1:34:04| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5644)|
| 1:34:06| Chris, you may not know the answer to this, because I thought schools would be on with us today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5646)|
| 1:34:11| Had a question from a South Knoxville resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| With schools being out quite a bit, going to virtual learning, he wanted to know if there could be reduction in property tax.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5655)|
| 1:34:24| And I don't think so, because even though the kids are not in school, we still have salaries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5664)|
| 1:34:30| We still have lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| It's got to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5672)|
| 1:34:33| Heating, cooling, no matter what.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5673)|
| 1:34:35| So I guess if you would, do you think that there has been any savings at all during this pandemic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5675)|
| 1:34:47| Here's what I would say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5687)|
| 1:34:48| I would say, and Ron can speak to this much more than I could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5688)|
| 1:34:55| I think, you know, for the most this fiscal year, this school year, you've had some kids that are virtual, some that are in school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5695)|
| 1:35:04| So I don't know if you had really any savings because you're having to keep all campuses open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5704)|
| 1:35:10| And so I think if anything, the schools have had additional expenses that's related to virtual learning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5710)|
| 1:35:19| You all have approved some of the contracts for the virtual learning, the one-to-one technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5719)|
| 1:35:27| We did a grant for trying to get every student the ability to be able to have Wi-Fi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5727)|
| 1:35:37| And so I do not believe there is a savings because basically those buildings are not closed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5737)|
| 1:35:44| They're still open and you just have the option of going virtual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5744)|
| 1:35:50| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5750)|
| 1:35:51| During the education committee meeting, the schools told us they're $10 million above in just the PPE equipment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5751)|
| 1:35:59| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5759)|
| 1:36:00| Over what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5760)|
| 1:36:01| $10 million over that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| So that's an amazing number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5763)|
| 1:36:05| Commissioner Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5765)|
| 1:36:09| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5769)|
| 1:36:12| Chris, looking at our, I think you said our current debt level is $670 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5772)|
| 1:36:20| They're about $660 million, somewhere in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5780)|
| 1:36:23| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5783)|
| 1:36:24| We have three schools and some major road projects in our five-year capital plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5784)|
| 1:36:29| I'm assuming that's going to be, I don't know, what is it, $50 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5789)|
| 1:36:36| Yeah, I think the schools are, you know, $15 to $18 a piece.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5796)|
| 1:36:41| Actually, I think they're about $8 to $8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5801)|
| 1:36:43| I think with the increase in construction costs, I think the schools are probably going to be like $18 to $20 now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5803)|
| 1:36:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5809)|
| 1:36:50| And then is Chadrow completely funded yet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5810)|
| 1:36:54| I think we may have the final piece of it coming this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5814)|
| 1:36:58| We'll get with Jim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5818)|
| 1:36:59| He's not turning in his budget yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5819)|
| 1:37:01| It's not due yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5821)|
| 1:37:02| But I think maybe the final piece is coming this year, or it'll show up in the five-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5822)|
| 1:37:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5827)|
| 1:37:08| So we're looking at, let's say $660 million, $50 million, $60 million in new debt the next five years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5828)|
| 1:37:16| What is the offset on our schedule, our paydown schedule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5836)|
| 1:37:21| Where do you think we're going to land in about five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| You know, ultimately, we ‑‑ so he had Chadrow going, got Randy just so you know, to FY23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5845)|
| 1:37:40| And so we'll see how that goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5860)|
| 1:37:42| But ultimately, paydown, we have over the next 21 through 25, we have planned bond payments of about $228 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5862)|
| 1:37:59| And so, you know, as long as, you know, we can stay within that number, hopefully lower,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5879)|
| 1:38:08| then we can actually pay down some of that and not increase our total bonded indebtedness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5888)|
| 1:38:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5896)|
| 1:38:17| Now, that was debt service, wasn't it, the $228 million?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5897)|
| 1:38:20| Or was that the reduction off the books of bonds?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5900)|
| 1:38:23| That's what we would pay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5903)|
| 1:38:24| So that would be the revenue to pay down the debt service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5904)|
| 1:38:30| Well, actually, I'm sorry, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5910)|
| 1:38:35| I'm telling you wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5915)|
| 1:38:36| The planned principal payments on bonds for the next five years is $220.7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5916)|
| 1:38:43| And so in our five‑year plan, we had planned bond issuances of about $228, which is about $7 million,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5923)|
| 1:38:54| the opposite way that we'd like to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5934)|
| 1:38:56| Now, what we don't show on those schedules, though, are premiums.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5936)|
| 1:39:00| And so what we can do is use the premium bill just to lower that amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5940)|
| 1:39:06| And sometimes our premiums, you know, are quite substantial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5946)|
| 1:39:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5951)|
| 1:39:12| One last question when it comes to how that schedule reduces.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5952)|
| 1:39:15| I know when Hardin Valley was built, it was built with interest only 30‑year bonds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5955)|
| 1:39:21| We should start to get into that at some point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5961)|
| 1:39:24| That will show a reduction on the liability side far greater than normal debt service would do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5964)|
| 1:39:31| because we're hitting big strokes of principals in the amount of, what, five, six million a year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5971)|
| 1:39:37| Seven or eight, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5977)|
| 1:39:39| I think it's seven and a half for Hardin Valley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5979)|
| 1:39:42| I think that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5982)|
| 1:39:43| So I think we start paying that in 2027, and the principal piece goes to, like, 2034.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5983)|
| 1:39:49| Now, you know, the good news is we've got that programmed in our schedule,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5989)|
| 1:39:54| so we have the ability to make those debt service payments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=5994)|
| 1:40:00| But it will help from the standpoint of lowering our principal bonded indebtedness amount.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=6000)|
| 1:40:16| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=6016)|
| 1:40:19| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=6019)|
| 1:40:20| Any other questions for Chris or the team about anything you've seen here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=6020)|
| 1:40:23| Or a lot to digest, but good information nonetheless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=6023)|
| 1:40:30| Chris, I'm not seeing anything, so I know a few people have to drop off,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=6030)|
| 1:40:33| but we will send the recording out and the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=6033)|
| 1:40:36| I've got the slide deck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=6036)|
| 1:40:37| And I appreciate everybody's time today, lots of good information,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=6037)|
| 1:40:42| and appreciate all the hard work, Chris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=6044)|
| 1:40:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=6045)|
| 1:40:46| Thank you very much, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=6046)|
| 1:40:47| Have a great afternoon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/co-com-r-265-210208-chairmans-briefing?start=6047)|
