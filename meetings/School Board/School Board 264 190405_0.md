| 0:00:00| I'd like to call this meeting to order and we're going to begin with a moment of silence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=0)|
| 0:00:22| and the Pledge of Allegiance led by Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=22)|
| 0:00:45| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=45)|
| 0:01:07| I'm looking to see if there are any elected officials in the audience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=67)|
| 0:01:10| Please raise your hand if I've not spotted you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=70)|
| 0:01:16| Just by way of information, Mr. McMillan is not able to make it tonight because of a family illness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=76)|
| 0:01:24| We are also, minus Ms. Bounds, who is heading toward the birth of another grandchild, and we're also absent our board secretary, Terry Coatney,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=84)|
| 0:01:40| who has had some personal illness but is recovering nicely, but we know Ms. Good can absolutely take care of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=100)|
| 0:01:50| So anyway, we're glad you're here. You bet, you bet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=110)|
| 0:01:55| By way of another announcement, when the board approved our annual calendar last summer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=115)|
| 0:02:01| we tentatively scheduled a called meeting for consideration for the fiscal year 2020 budget for April 10th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=121)|
| 0:02:09| Now that we have a better understanding of the timing of BEP projections, which are still very fluid from what I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=129)|
| 0:02:19| Superintendent Thomas and I agreed to put this meeting off to our quarterly workshop, which was already scheduled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=139)|
| 0:02:27| and that's going to be on Wednesday, April 24th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| So we will be discussing at the beginning of that evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=151)|
| 0:02:35| We'll have a called meeting to discuss the budget and also to vote on the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=155)|
| 0:02:42| We have to have it submitted by April 30th to county commissions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=162)|
| 0:02:46| So that is the time frame we're on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=166)|
| 0:02:50| Mr. Thomas, did you want to add anything about the budget meeting, the fact that we're doing it when we're doing it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=170)|
| 0:03:00| Yes, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=180)|
| 0:03:01| We've tried to throughout the year, I guess, try to provide more information to the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=181)|
| 0:03:07| and we're still working on a recommendation, but we'll have that information ready for you at the workshop| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=187)|
| 0:03:15| or the special called meeting and get the budget approved, hopefully, at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=195)|
| 0:03:20| And in the meantime, to be available to respond to any questions that you might have, as we have tried to do in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=200)|
| 0:03:28| All right. Thank you. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=208)|
| 0:03:30| And we really appreciate the work that a lot of our constituents out there have done toward really examining the budgeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=210)|
| 0:03:43| Everybody's working hard to come up with the best numbers that we can at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=223)|
| 0:03:48| Also, before I get on to changes in the agenda, with the board's indulgence, this is not down,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=228)|
| 0:03:56| but I'd like to ask Jennifer Owens to go ahead and give us a recent update, a class report on what's been happening in Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=236)|
| 0:04:05| All right. We've been going back and forth to Nashville the past few weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=245)|
| 0:04:10| and we are looking especially at three fairly damaging bills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| The first has to do with creating a state board that would be a charter authorizer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=256)|
| 0:04:24| So what that means is that when a charter school wants to apply to be a charter school in our county, they would not have to come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=264)|
| 0:04:34| They could go directly to that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=274)|
| 0:04:36| And even though they have changed the language in that bill somewhat, it still says that they may come to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=276)|
| 0:04:44| It does not say that they have to come to their local board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=284)|
| 0:04:48| So anyone who wanted to start a charter school anywhere in the state could go directly to that state charter authorizing board that is an appointed board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=288)|
| 0:04:56| It's not elected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=296)|
| 0:04:58| And just by having that board, it gives them a financial interest in being there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=298)|
| 0:05:06| because if they're not approving any schools, then obviously you don't need that board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=306)|
| 0:05:11| But if they are approving lots and lots of schools, then they obviously are necessary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=311)|
| 0:05:17| The other thing that does is it creates a school district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=317)|
| 0:05:21| That board becomes an LEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=321)|
| 0:05:24| So it takes all those charter schools that they are approving, and it makes them the LEA for those charter schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=324)|
| 0:05:32| And they can put them anywhere they want to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=332)|
| 0:05:34| If they wanted to put five charter schools right next to one of our schools, they could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| And we would have absolutely no say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=339)|
| 0:05:42| There are also some parts that are very concerning because they talk about land that is not fully used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=342)|
| 0:05:49| And some questions that have come up have to do with whether the land is fully occupied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=349)|
| 0:05:55| and whether a charter school could take over a building that is brand new but is not fully occupied yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=355)|
| 0:06:02| And no one has successfully answered that question about whether a charter school could come in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=362)|
| 0:06:07| while a county is building a building and take over that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=367)|
| 0:06:12| So those are some very concerning parts in that piece of legislation that's moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=372)|
| 0:06:17| The other bill that is still moving is House Bill 939.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=377)|
| 0:06:23| And it is the Education Savings Account, or ESA, voucher program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=383)|
| 0:06:28| And it has nothing at all to do with education savings accounts the way we know them with a bank.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=388)|
| 0:06:35| Throughout its passage through each committee, they have changed quite a lot of the language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=395)|
| 0:06:40| It started as a caption bill, which means that it's a very broadly captioned piece of legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=400)|
| 0:06:47| that could really have almost anything attached to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=407)|
| 0:06:50| So everything in the amendment is the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=410)|
| 0:06:53| There's nothing from that original bill that's still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=413)|
| 0:06:56| And they have been amending it as close to meeting time as the morning of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=416)|
| 0:07:03| So it might be 9 a.m. that morning, they are going to have a meeting at noon,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=423)|
| 0:07:07| and they have just gotten a 17- or 20-page bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=427)|
| 0:07:11| So they have taken some things out, or they've taken some language out,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=431)|
| 0:07:15| but they haven't necessarily removed the concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=435)|
| 0:07:18| The biggest concern that I personally have that has been the same in all of these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=438)|
| 0:07:24| and is also in our current law under the IEA voucher program that they passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=444)|
| 0:07:30| is that when a participating student accepts these funds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| participation in the program has the same effect as a parental refusal to consent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=456)|
| 0:07:41| to the receipt of services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=461)|
| 0:07:46| In other words, accepting the funds means they give up their federal rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=466)|
| 0:07:52| to all special education services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=472)|
| 0:07:56| And that's the language directly in the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=476)|
| 0:07:59| So they would have no rights at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=479)|
| 0:08:02| Their school that they're going to would not have to provide any special education services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| Additionally, if they return to a public school, if they had an IEP before, that's gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| They have to start all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=493)|
| 0:08:16| But there's nothing that says they would have to start all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=496)|
| 0:08:19| So they might also not have those rights in their public school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=499)|
| 0:08:23| So that is also concerning because there's nothing in the legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=503)|
| 0:08:26| that anyone has been able to point to that says those rights ever return.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=506)|
| 0:08:32| The next part that is concerning is that they don't actually have to spend all of the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=512)|
| 0:08:40| So $7,300, you'd think that we already realize that's not enough to educate a student for a year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=520)|
| 0:08:47| But the parent also doesn't have to spend them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=527)|
| 0:08:50| They could be putting them into a fund drawing interest toward college| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=530)|
| 0:08:53| for this whole time that the student is doing whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=533)|
| 0:08:57| And that's concerning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=537)|
| 0:08:59| Lots of people are talking about 13 years of that, but it's not actually 13 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| It's actually 17 years because a student could do that either until they graduate or turn 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=543)|
| 0:09:11| So it actually incentivizes the student to not graduate on time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=551)|
| 0:09:18| So it would incentivize them to wait until age 22 to have that additional funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=558)|
| 0:09:23| However, at age 18, not mentioning their ability at all, at age 18,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=563)|
| 0:09:31| all of the control of that money automatically goes to the student.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=571)|
| 0:09:35| It is no longer in the parent's control at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=575)|
| 0:09:38| So even if they may not be able to handle that fund, it's theirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=578)|
| 0:09:47| The last thing I guess I really need to mention is that it has been sold as something| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=587)|
| 0:09:55| especially for low-income students in high-needs areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=595)|
| 0:10:01| However, the cap, which they've brought down a little bit, but it is still two times the cost| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=601)|
| 0:10:09| or the threshold for free lunch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=609)|
| 0:10:13| So that would give a family of four, I believe, about $64,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=613)|
| 0:10:19| However, that's only the year prior to the student taking the funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=619)|
| 0:10:26| Their parent could be making a million dollars this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=626)|
| 0:10:30| It doesn't matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=630)|
| 0:10:31| If they only made $64,000 last year or anything less than that for that family of four,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=631)|
| 0:10:37| then that student can take that funding until they turn 22.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=637)|
| 0:10:42| So for 17 years, that would be their funding, even if their parents are making millions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=642)|
| 0:10:49| So that's another piece that has not been removed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=649)|
| 0:10:53| They've talked about removing the homeschool section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=653)|
| 0:10:56| However, it doesn't say anything about a cooperative that might be two homes side by side.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=656)|
| 0:11:02| That's still a small school, and so there are still concerns there also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=662)|
| 0:11:08| The Homeschool Association was very concerned about delegitimizing what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=668)|
| 0:11:16| And so that concern is still there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=676)|
| 0:11:19| Even though they've taken out the words homeschool, it could still be that small collaborative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=679)|
| 0:11:24| And I might also mention that one of those small collaboratives that is funded by Betsy DeVos| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=684)|
| 0:11:31| has been showing up locally in Facebook ads toward our parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=691)|
| 0:11:39| I had a parent send me a copy of their ad the other day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=699)|
| 0:11:42| and they're being targeted through Facebook ads for that small school collaborative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=702)|
| 0:11:48| So that's something to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| And I would very strongly recommend that everyone call your legislator| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=710)|
| 0:11:54| and let them know how you feel about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=714)|
| 0:11:59| Call them often.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=719)|
| 0:12:01| And if they tell you that these words are gone, ask them to show you that they're gone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=721)|
| 0:12:07| One of the gentlemen who is not one of our legislators but from another county| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=727)|
| 0:12:11| who switched his vote between the time that the subcommittee met and the time that the committee met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=731)|
| 0:12:18| did not realize that special education students would be giving up their rights under IDEA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=738)|
| 0:12:24| He had no idea, and he had already voted to pass this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=744)|
| 0:12:28| So please help your legislators understand that this is more than just people saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=748)|
| 0:12:33| hey, we don't want this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=753)|
| 0:12:35| This is highly damaging to students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=755)|
| 0:12:38| and they really need to step back and take some time to realize what they're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=758)|
| 0:12:45| I have another one, but we'll save it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=765)|
| 0:12:47| We'll do it another time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=767)|
| 0:12:48| It's not moving as fast.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=768)|
| 0:12:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=771)|
| 0:12:52| You're doing a great job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=772)|
| 0:12:53| Ms. Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=774)|
| 0:12:55| And Ms. Owen, thank you so much for keeping us in the loop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=775)|
| 0:12:57| It's hard to keep up with all the amendments, so I didn't know where we were today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=777)|
| 0:13:01| Has anything changed on the language at the beginning was that because our district has schools on the priority list| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=781)|
| 0:13:10| that any of our students are eligible?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=790)|
| 0:13:13| Is that still the case?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=793)|
| 0:13:14| Because it certainly ought to only be priority school students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=794)|
| 0:13:18| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=798)|
| 0:13:19| So any county that has three or more schools on the priority list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=799)|
| 0:13:23| any county that has three or more schools that are in that 10%,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=803)|
| 0:13:28| any student in the entire district would be eligible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=808)|
| 0:13:32| If they took that funding in kindergarten from Knox County Schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=812)|
| 0:13:37| and they moved to another county, they still get to take it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=817)|
| 0:13:41| even if their county is not one of those challenged areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=821)|
| 0:13:49| It's our understanding that it would still come out of our funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=829)|
| 0:13:53| Thank you, Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=833)|
| 0:13:54| If you'll keep us informed, that would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=834)|
| 0:13:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=836)|
| 0:13:59| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=839)|
| 0:14:00| I know you've worked hard at keeping abreast of that, and your updates are greatly appreciated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=840)|
| 0:14:06| Thank you so much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=846)|
| 0:14:10| Moving on, are there any requested changes to the meeting agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=850)|
| 0:14:15| Yes, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=855)|
| 0:14:16| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=856)|
| 0:14:17| I'd just like to add a discussion item, and we'll just call it certified employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=857)|
| 0:14:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=868)|
| 0:14:29| To understand, you'd like that at the end of tonight's workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=869)|
| 0:14:33| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=873)|
| 0:14:34| That's okay, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=874)|
| 0:14:41| Do I hear any objections to this addition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=881)|
| 0:14:45| If not, all in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=885)|
| 0:14:47| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=887)|
| 0:14:48| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=888)|
| 0:14:50| We will add it to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=890)|
| 0:14:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=893)|
| 0:14:57| Mr. Thomas, our superintendent's report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=897)|
| 0:15:00| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=900)|

| 0:15:46| for the challenging job of being a public school superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=946)|

| 0:16:54| Madam Chair, members of the Board, this concludes my report for this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1014)|
| 0:16:58| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1018)|
| 0:17:00| Does the Board have any questions of Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1020)|
| 0:17:03| Yes, Mr. Thomas, Superintendent Thomas, could you tell me the date of the Dine Out again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1023)|
| 0:17:07| I see the flyer, but I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1027)|
| 0:17:08| Oh, yes. The date for Dine Out Education, Tuesday, April 9.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1028)|
| 0:17:13| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1033)|
| 0:17:14| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1034)|
| 0:17:15| All right. Without further discussion, then, we'll move on to the agenda items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1035)|
| 0:17:20| I am looking at 5, letter C, number 1, number 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1040)|
| 0:17:48| 8, moving on to Board policies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1068)|
| 0:17:56| Just for your information, these are all second readings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1076)|
| 0:18:02| Policy A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and H.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1082)|
| 0:18:24| Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1104)|
| 0:18:28| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1108)|
| 0:18:30| I'd like to, let's see, I've lost track here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1110)|
| 0:18:35| You're going too fast for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1115)|
| 0:18:37| Oh, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1117)|
| 0:18:38| 131, I would like to ask 131 and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1118)|
| 0:18:46| Which is item F.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1126)|
| 0:18:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1128)|
| 0:18:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1129)|
| 0:18:50| And then also the public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1130)|
| 0:18:54| Is public forum on here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1134)|
| 0:18:55| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1135)|
| 0:18:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1136)|
| 0:18:57| 180 and 131.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1137)|
| 0:18:59| I'd like to ask those to be sent back to the policy review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1139)|
| 0:19:16| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1156)|
| 0:19:17| So you're requesting they be sent back to policy review as opposed to board discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1157)|
| 0:19:22| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1162)|
| 0:19:25| I think that's, yeah, I think that's the best place to do the discussion for these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1165)|
| 0:19:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| We're looking at policy A then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1174)|
| 0:19:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1179)|
| 0:19:40| Could I make it, should I make it as a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1180)|
| 0:19:43| The review committee is next Wednesday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1183)|
| 0:19:45| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1185)|
| 0:19:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1186)|
| 0:19:47| Then I'd like to make that as a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1187)|
| 0:19:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1189)|
| 0:19:50| I'd like to make a motion to move A and F to refer them back to policy review committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1190)|
| 0:19:58| Mr. Dupler, is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1198)|
| 0:20:01| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1201)|
| 0:20:02| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1202)|
| 0:20:03| And Mr. Norman and I were talking about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1203)|
| 0:20:05| I mean, what, I mean, I think tonight, I mean, it's good for him to point this out and discuss it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1205)|
| 0:20:14| But, I mean, the proper way to do it would be to make a motion at next week's voting meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1214)|
| 0:20:19| and then ask at the beginning of the, before the agenda is approved,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1219)|
| 0:20:24| to go ahead and ask to remove those for the policy review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1224)|
| 0:20:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1228)|
| 0:20:29| I appreciate that since this is a workshop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1229)|
| 0:20:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1233)|
| 0:20:34| Having that be regarded as the appropriate format,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1234)|
| 0:20:40| I will ask again then, since this is a workshop, is there any discussion on board policy A?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1240)|
| 0:20:50| And Mr. Norman, I'm assuming your light is off now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1250)|
| 0:20:52| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1252)|
| 0:20:53| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1253)|
| 0:20:54| And again, any discussion on policy F?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1254)|
| 0:21:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1261)|
| 0:21:02| Moving along to number seven, grants, letter A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1262)|
| 0:21:08| Is this on grants?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1268)|
| 0:21:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1269)|
| 0:21:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1270)|
| 0:21:11| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1271)|
| 0:21:12| Yes, Mr. Thomas, I'm just looking at this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1272)|
| 0:21:15| And since it's from the city of Knoxville, is it confined to city schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1275)|
| 0:21:19| or will it be just a little bit more explanation on this grant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1279)|
| 0:21:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| And Mr. Oaks, we had a conversation just the other day, so Russ has got a little bit more information on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1286)|
| 0:21:32| So, Mr. Oaks, if you would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1292)|
| 0:21:34| It's actually a federal grant that we applied for in partnership with the city of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| and the city manages it, and it is not limited to just schools in the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1299)|
| 0:21:45| Will it be working with, I guess from my reading of it, it's basically to better train our RSOs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1305)|
| 0:21:52| There are a number of things that we're going to do with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1312)|
| 0:21:55| There's training involved in there, and there's some purchases of minor equipment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1315)|
| 0:21:59| some campus-based radios and some laptops for security officers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1319)|
| 0:22:07| and then some funding in there for us to look at visitor management systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1327)|
| 0:22:15| And the principals have been asking us, or it's something they're very interested in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1335)|
| 0:22:19| and we need to do a little more research on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1339)|
| 0:22:22| And there's sort of a space holder in there to give us some funds to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1342)|
| 0:22:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1347)|

| 0:23:56| Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1436)|
| 0:23:58| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1438)|
| 0:23:59| I had a little conversation with Gary Dupler about Constitution Day, but Superintendent Thomas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1439)|
| 0:24:05| could you, if you have any additional information on what that day is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1445)|
| 0:24:10| I know we talked about it could be what Governor Lee kind of talked about with the civics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1450)|
| 0:24:15| but do we have any idea what we would do as Knox County Schools to make that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1455)|
| 0:24:20| And which, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1460)|
| 0:24:22| The date on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1462)|
| 0:24:23| September 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1463)|
| 0:24:25| No, what date is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1465)|
| 0:24:26| September 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1466)|
| 0:24:36| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1476)|
| 0:24:37| Dr. Rice, I know you and the calendar committee worked on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1477)|
| 0:24:43| The question about September 17th, Constitutional Day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1483)|
| 0:24:48| I'll say this while I call Ms. Judy Nugent up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1488)|
| 0:24:50| We have an expert in the crowd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1490)|
| 0:24:52| It is basically the teaching and lessons and activities around the Constitution for that time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1492)|
| 0:24:58| but Ms. Nugent will be able to fill us in more as our social studies supervisor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1498)|
| 0:25:04| Yeah, I would just like to know what, and I know it's early stages.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1504)|
| 0:25:08| What do we have, what would that look like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1508)|
| 0:25:16| Thank you, Judy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1516)|
| 0:25:17| Thank you for asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1517)|
| 0:25:19| We have September 17th on the calendar every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1519)|
| 0:25:22| It's a very important day, obviously, for many reasons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1522)|
| 0:25:25| So in the recent past, we have had in service for our teachers preceding September 17th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1525)|
| 0:25:32| We offer them a plethora of lessons, activities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1532)|
| 0:25:37| They are able to collaborate with their peers and take those suggestions that we often get from TDOE| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1537)|
| 0:25:44| and from other valid sites that we will research before we put this out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1544)|
| 0:25:49| So it is a very important event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1549)|
| 0:25:52| It's very important that every teacher pause and social studies teacher pause,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1552)|
| 0:25:57| and that is the intent behind it, to recognize Constitution Day| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1557)|
| 0:26:03| and to possibly take the suggested lessons that we put online and we put them on our school wires website.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1563)|
| 0:26:10| My instructional coaches, Dean Burris and Catherine Petko, worked hard this past, like I said, August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1570)|
| 0:26:16| and held an in-service, and so that's common practice that we promote it among all of our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1576)|
| 0:26:24| So it's pretty well advertised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1584)|
| 0:26:26| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1586)|
| 0:26:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1587)|
| 0:26:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1588)|
| 0:26:30| Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1590)|
| 0:26:32| Yes, I don't think we've done it in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1592)|
| 0:26:35| I notice it's not on this year's calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1595)|
| 0:26:37| But I know traditionally the day preceding the first real half day for students has been the new sixth graders| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1597)|
| 0:26:47| and new ninth graders visitation day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1607)|
| 0:26:50| And I'm wanting to see if we could actually put that on the calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1610)|
| 0:26:53| A lot of parents, especially as they're entering the middle school and the high school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1613)|
| 0:26:57| as they're trying to make plans for the summer, have no idea when that really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1617)|
| 0:27:00| So if we could actually officially add that, I think that would be very helpful to our parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1620)|
| 0:27:05| And I know there's probably nothing we can do about it, but I think the way it falls,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1625)|
| 0:27:10| kind of like it's falling this year and looks like it'll fall next year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1630)|
| 0:27:14| since we start school officially on a Monday, it means backing it up to the week before,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1634)|
| 0:27:19| which is even getting earlier in August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1639)|
| 0:27:21| I don't know that anything can be done about that, but I do hate that it's like we're taking another week away of the summer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1641)|
| 0:27:28| So anyway, even if we can't do it, I hope that we'll officially mark that on the calendars to help parents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1648)|
| 0:27:35| Dr. Reisworth, didn't I see a change in formatting on those first days for our rising sixth and ninth graders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1655)|
| 0:27:45| Thank you, Madam Chair. Thank you, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1665)|
| 0:27:47| So I don't think that, I mean, I think we can do that, add that to the calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1667)|
| 0:27:51| I'll get with Mr. Trent and we'll make sure we have those on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1671)|
| 0:27:53| He did get input from principals about when the best day would be to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1673)|
| 0:27:57| I think historically we've done it right up until where the next day kids come,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1677)|
| 0:28:01| and I think the principals have asked that we move that back a day so they have another day to prepare for students coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1681)|
| 0:28:08| So I think that's what you're referring to, Ms. Hill, and it wouldn't be a big deal for us to put that on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1688)|
| 0:28:13| We can add that to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1693)|
| 0:28:15| If I could just say a little bit about how the committee works and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1695)|
| 0:28:20| So every year we kind of get the same cast of characters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1700)|
| 0:28:26| They're different people, but they have different roles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1706)|
| 0:28:28| So this year we had nine teachers, three parents, KCEA, the Knox County PTA,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| the principals that recognize the association leaders of every grade band, high school, middle school, elementary,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1714)|
| 0:28:40| and then ten different district departments that all came together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1720)|
| 0:28:43| And, you know, it is a big deal, but it's kind of fun to get that whole group together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1723)|
| 0:28:47| because they all have different ideas from their perspective of what's kind of happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1727)|
| 0:28:51| So we get everybody together, we go over the state laws that are required in the calendar,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1731)|
| 0:28:55| and the number of days for this, the number of days for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1735)|
| 0:28:58| And so that was, to your point, Ms. Babb, we usually put two drafts out for them to have something to react to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1738)|
| 0:29:04| and we actually came out with version three out of the committee that we didn't have in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1744)|
| 0:29:08| And that was one of the concerns about moving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1748)|
| 0:29:11| There's something about if it's a July start versus an August start that they didn't really like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1751)|
| 0:29:15| And so they elected to move those days into that timeframe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1755)|
| 0:29:20| The other one is around winter break, which is always, we had some versions that broke midweek,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1760)|
| 0:29:25| and a lot of the principals and teachers talked about attendance being really down in those first couple days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1765)|
| 0:29:30| So to shift that back to where it was a Friday that ended those days seemed to make sense, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1770)|
| 0:29:36| Another thing that they put in for this year that's different than we've had in the past was the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1776)|
| 0:29:41| if you look at the sheet that talks about the spread of the days, first semester has 85 days and second has 92.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1781)|
| 0:29:48| And they've just looked at historically, if it's not been snow, it's been flu or this year flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1788)|
| 0:29:53| And the teachers really mentioned that squeeze on the day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1793)|
| 0:29:56| So if they, you know, they think it will pretty much come out in a wash to have 85 per semester to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1796)|
| 0:30:01| So that was another adjustment we kind of made to this calendar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1801)|
| 0:30:04| So those are, they were, like you said, not wanting to start back even on in-service in July, and we get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1804)|
| 0:30:11| So we made that adjustment as far as we could and still get that split to where, you know, kind of Christmas falls were Christmas falls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1811)|
| 0:30:17| You try to get to where you can have all the days to do that end of the year test and that sort of thing each semester to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1817)|
| 0:30:23| So that was some of their thinking that was maybe a little different this year for the one coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1823)|
| 0:30:27| But a good meeting, good conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1827)|
| 0:30:31| One more question I have, just looking at the 2021 schedule, kind of referring to what is happening for this upcoming year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1831)|
| 0:30:38| If you look on August 10th, it's going to be the first day of school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1838)|
| 0:30:43| August 7th, because it sounds like this coming year, they're wanting a teacher day before the school start, kids start on Monday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1843)|
| 0:30:50| But for the 2021 year, the kids, like the sixth graders and, no, incoming sixth graders and incoming ninth graders,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1850)|
| 0:30:59| probably they would not want them starting on August 6th in that year because that is an election day and the primary will be held for the presidential primary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1859)|
| 0:31:07| So I just didn't know if they're taking that into account in that year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1867)|
| 0:31:12| Good question. And so we have worked with Cliff Rogers and had some great meetings with them on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1872)|
| 0:31:17| The change that I was talking about for this year was is for the 19-20 calendar that we're going to move that to a Thursday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1877)|
| 0:31:26| And Mr. Trent has given me the head nod that we're right on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| OK, so that we're moving that to the that will be Thursday for this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1888)|
| 0:31:33| Kind of we can go year to year on that. We've never tried doing this a day before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1893)|
| 0:31:37| So we'll see what it looks like now and get input. But I think you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1897)|
| 0:31:40| If it does work, we might have to move it to that Wednesday and then or Friday again, we'll get we'll get feedback on how we do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1900)|
| 0:31:48| But if we're going to mark it on the calendar on the front end, that's probably a discussion we need to have a little bit more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1908)|
| 0:31:55| Miss Horn. Thank you, Madam Chair. So my question, you've kind of addressed it already.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1915)|
| 0:31:59| First of all, I like the way this calendar falls. It's nice the way the fall semester is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1919)|
| 0:32:04| But and obviously we do end up usually not using all of the days during the second semester because of all the issues we have in schools out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1924)|
| 0:32:13| So we typically have 88 or 89 days in the fall semester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1933)|
| 0:32:19| So having 85 days, you feel like will probably still be comparable in the spring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1939)|
| 0:32:24| And that won't be a strain for those block classes in the fall season when they're going to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1944)|
| 0:32:32| Because that's quite a when you just look at the calendar, 85 to 92 is quite a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1952)|
| 0:32:39| That's a good question. And again, one that the committee talked back and forth about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1959)|
| 0:32:43| And I think if you look at if you kind of look at our last three year trend, we've used seven to eight days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1963)|
| 0:32:50| So if you subtract those away in the 92, you're right back at that 85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1970)|
| 0:32:53| And I think, you know, they felt like based on what we've seen, you know, I think before there were such thing as flu days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1973)|
| 0:33:00| But, you know, it affects our adults a lot in our bus drivers and substitutes and that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1980)|
| 0:33:06| So I think they're just I think they've got the committee had gotten a lot of input around that, that the crunch for spring was a lot tighter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1986)|
| 0:33:13| You know, it's been a long time since we missed a day in the fall and they felt like they could get it done in those 85 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1993)|
| 0:33:18| OK, thank you. Right. Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=1998)|
| 0:33:24| All right. Still under regular agenda items. See. Miss Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2004)|
| 0:33:33| Thank you, Madam Chair. My question on this was in looking over this, there are a lot of books on here that are consumables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2013)|
| 0:33:41| And I've talked with some science teachers, particularly about consumables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| And I know I've mentioned this to Dr. Reiswick already, that they would rather have the actual book versus consumables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2026)|
| 0:33:56| So can can someone speak to that? And I'm sure it was discussed in the committee, but just kind of that issue, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2036)|
| 0:34:08| If it's OK, I'll have Miss Jackson and I know Miss Searles is here as well. So we'll tag team if we need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2048)|
| 0:34:13| Good evening, Madam Chair, members of the board. We have had a lot of conversations around the consumable, the digital and the direction that textbooks are going.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2053)|
| 0:34:21| I do have people here who can probably speak more to the granular decisions that our committee's made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2061)|
| 0:34:27| But in many cases, as they're looking at the content, this was the decision of this teacher committee as they they were able to review all the options and have copies of everything in front of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2067)|
| 0:34:37| And so they weighed all of those options as they then gave us their recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| So if you'd like me to have somebody who can speak to a particular discipline, I'd be happy to to call somebody up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2081)|
| 0:34:48| Well, my question was really more of just a general question because it had come up regarding the science textbook or consumables versus the textbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2088)|
| 0:34:56| So, you know, I knew you probably had had that conversation. So I just thought this would be an appropriate time to address that again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2096)|
| 0:35:04| And so basically that this is what the teachers that were on the committee preferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2104)|
| 0:35:11| It is. These are the teachers who were sworn in and the committee, which I think the board approved those members in November.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2111)|
| 0:35:18| And we asked them to really think about making sure that there's equity and access to the materials as they're considering them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2118)|
| 0:35:24| And so I think in many cases, you know, that's where the whole conversation about the structure of how the material is delivered and handed to the students is part of what the teachers are thinking about when they make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2124)|
| 0:35:36| OK, thank you. Thank you. Miss Jackson, wasn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2136)|
| 0:35:40| Do I recall correctly that there's also a cost differential? There can be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2140)|
| 0:35:46| What we have figured out is that as things have moved to the digital and the consumable and the hard copy textbook, the publishers, they are getting paid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2146)|
| 0:35:56| So they have figured out how to make their expenses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2156)|
| 0:36:01| So we have found that it's not necessarily cheaper to go with one route versus the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2161)|
| 0:36:07| And our teachers actually at the committees who are reviewing the textbooks are not supposed to see pricing when they're making those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2167)|
| 0:36:14| Miss Horne. Thank you. I'm sorry. I have another question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2174)|
| 0:36:17| Another another issue, since we're talking about history, you know, there's always the conversation of revision, revision of history and whether we have true history reflected in our textbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2177)|
| 0:36:28| So is they when the committee is reviewing these social studies textbooks, I'm assuming that they are looking for specific items that are that they would be able to recognize if we have accurate information in our textbooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2188)|
| 0:36:43| These are our social studies teachers who teach those specific courses, who are reviewing the materials.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2203)|
| 0:36:48| And this is true with any of our disciplines. The state puts out a rubric for us to use that is also developed by a teacher committee the year prior to the adoption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2208)|
| 0:36:57| So they're looking for those elements that could potentially be significant barriers or significant positives to a particular textbook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2217)|
| 0:37:09| And those would be very discipline specific. So and then the teachers on the textbook committee are trained in how to use those materials and make their selections from that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2229)|
| 0:37:18| But they have access to the full range of the content that they are looking through with their professional expertise to make those decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2238)|
| 0:37:27| OK, thank you. All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2247)|
| 0:37:34| Moving along to item D.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2254)|
| 0:37:42| And E. Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2262)|
| 0:37:49| Thank you, Madam Chair. I'd just like to on item D, I'd just like to congratulate Scott and say, well, he's just given us great service and it's been my pleasure to work with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2269)|
| 0:38:04| I just think the system is doing a good thing by appointing him. Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2284)|
| 0:38:12| Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2292)|
| 0:38:17| All right. Looking at item E, this is discussion and possible action on the superintendent's evaluation process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2297)|
| 0:38:26| Miss Owen, would you like to address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2306)|
| 0:38:32| I would just remind everyone that this is just the tool that we are using, that we're looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2312)|
| 0:38:39| There may be some changes based on whether TIN ready is available. And so those would all come at the end of the year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2319)|
| 0:38:47| Obviously, we don't have any metrics yet since we don't have those. So those are not going to be included until we get them at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2327)|
| 0:38:56| We will go over this tool again and determine whether all of these pieces are parts that we need to include,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2336)|
| 0:39:05| or if there's something that has come up that we need to leave some questions out or change them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2345)|
| 0:39:12| If the Department of Research and Accountability has something else that we can use in their place, we could use that in their place or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2352)|
| 0:39:20| And we'll decide that at that time. So until we have that actual data, we are not voting on the data to be used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2360)|
| 0:39:27| We are only voting on this as the tool to use. All right. Miss Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2367)|
| 0:39:35| Yes, I have a question, and this is a lot from me just being first year in the process and having questions about that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2375)|
| 0:39:41| So you all might can clarify this. But it came up a little bit when we went to our training this weekend at National School Board Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2381)|
| 0:39:47| But I've noticed like in different categories, we average it. And so I guess what I'm curious about is, as far as giving feedback to the superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2387)|
| 0:39:56| like in a certain area, is he going to see actual scores he gets or just an average?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2396)|
| 0:40:03| Because one of the things they were pointing out is like, you know, you might have half the people give ones and half the people give fives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2403)|
| 0:40:09| which shows people are very different views. But it averages to a three that just seems like everything's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2409)|
| 0:40:15| So I just didn't know how we kind of handle that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2415)|
| 0:40:18| Mr. Dupler may want to clarify this. It's my understanding that all of this is public record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2418)|
| 0:40:22| OK. And so he sees everything that we put in it. OK, that's great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2422)|
| 0:40:30| And if I may, each of these categories that sort of average together, last time that we did this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2430)|
| 0:40:38| I was curious about, you know, what what if we averaged it differently and didn't average the categories and then average the numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2438)|
| 0:40:46| Would it come out differently? And I actually I actually went through and did the math with the numbers that we had used in our actual evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2446)|
| 0:40:56| And it came out almost exactly the same, regardless of which way we organized it and did it using those actual numbers that we used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2456)|
| 0:41:05| So I think it's it's not going to significantly adjust anything if we average it this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2465)|
| 0:41:14| And that also gives us gives us an opportunity and the superintendent an opportunity to look at a score in an area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2474)|
| 0:41:26| Any other questions, comments? And Mr. Thomas, I understand that you've seen this document also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2486)|
| 0:41:34| Yes, ma'am. I've worked with Ms. Owen and I'm very comfortable with the evaluation and understand that, you know, you're my bosses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2494)|
| 0:41:43| So whatever the valuation is, I'll do my best to to live up to it. Do a good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2503)|
| 0:41:49| All right. Thank you. Thank you. And Ms. Owen, you and your team, Ms. Bounds and well, I started on it before this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2509)|
| 0:42:00| Yes. But you also had when I dropped off, was it you, Ms. Horn?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2520)|
| 0:42:07| Thank you. Thank you. This is if if you've never tried to write in an evaluation, let me tell you, it's it's a handful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2527)|
| 0:42:17| So thank you. Thank you for carrying through, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2537)|
| 0:42:21| Just one more question. And this is a little bit, like I said, me in the learning process of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2541)|
| 0:42:25| But in the one there's a section called increasing student achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2545)|
| 0:42:29| And when I look at those, a lot of it's about Mr. Thomas's leading his administrative team and that sort of stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2549)|
| 0:42:37| What are the tools we use to have the information to to evaluate him?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2557)|
| 0:42:45| There are several different things that we would have one. One of the most significant ones that we will have will be his self narrative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2565)|
| 0:42:51| And so that will give us an opportunity to look at what he is telling us that he believes he did in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2571)|
| 0:42:58| And then we can have that discussion individually. Also, we have some survey information that comes from the Office of Research and Accountability.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2578)|
| 0:43:09| And that will tell us where our employees stand on some of those issues and whether, for example,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2589)|
| 0:43:16| I think there's one that talks about whether they whether our certified employees consider it a good place to work and learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2596)|
| 0:43:23| And so that survey is where that kind of information would come from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2603)|
| 0:43:33| And you I mean, you repeated earlier also about if there's not a metric available, which some of these do require that, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2613)|
| 0:43:41| And I might also clarify the way that this was done long before I was a board member, it was all just narrative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2621)|
| 0:43:48| And so all the board members wrote paragraphs about how they felt that the superintendent had done over the past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2628)|
| 0:43:55| And then the chair's responsibility was to put all that together into the evaluation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2635)|
| 0:44:01| So it's kind of difficult to take paragraphs and put them together into something that is cohesive and representative of everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2641)|
| 0:44:11| So I think this will give us both of those opportunities since there is a section for our comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2651)|
| 0:44:18| And we also have that opportunity to discuss it with our superintendent and adjust however we might need to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2658)|
| 0:44:29| And also for clarification, Miss Babb, you will be meeting with the superintendent also on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2669)|
| 0:44:36| So that's that gives you the opportunity sometimes to expand on on things that are difficult to put put in writing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2676)|
| 0:44:47| So I always appreciate that opportunity for face to face.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2687)|
| 0:44:52| All right. Are there any other questions or comments on this tool?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2692)|
| 0:44:59| All right. And looking at item F, approve the 19 2019 to 24 five year strategic plan and a report from the committee, Miss Horn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2699)|
| 0:45:11| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2711)|
| 0:45:13| As you know, Miss Satterfield and Miss Owen and I worked on a draft that we brought to the board in a work session last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2713)|
| 0:45:22| And so the what you'll see in the smaller document is what we talked about last last time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2722)|
| 0:45:29| And I think everything that was discussed in that meeting is reflected in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2729)|
| 0:45:35| There were a couple of things that we kind of touched on that we may want to change, but we didn't land on what we actually wanted those to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2735)|
| 0:45:45| So if anyone has suggestions to those those two places, one was under reading proficiency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2745)|
| 0:45:53| provide dedicated and qualified instructional reading support for elementary schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2753)|
| 0:45:58| That was a suggestion. So we may want to look at that specifically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2758)|
| 0:46:02| The other one was under exceptional place to work and learn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2762)|
| 0:46:05| I think there was some question about the verbiage on create a minority educators advisory council to address and enhance staff diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2765)|
| 0:46:13| So those are kind of the two that we touched on that we might want to revisit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2773)|
| 0:46:18| So those would be the two that I would say we need to take a look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2778)|
| 0:46:23| And then if you'll look at the other document that includes the same information, but also includes the metrics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2783)|
| 0:46:31| the the one one thing that we talked about was having a CTE measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2791)|
| 0:46:39| And there's been some conversation and I've talked with Keith Wilson today about whether if you look at the bottom of increasing student achievement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2799)|
| 0:46:51| this page that is the metrics for that section under ready graduates, we talked about having some sort of specific CTE measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2811)|
| 0:47:03| But in further conversation, I think we may address that with the one above it, the percent percentage of graduates deemed ready graduates.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2823)|
| 0:47:13| So if the board doesn't mind, I'd like to have Mr. Wilson just speak to that so that he can tell you kind of more about the conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2833)|
| 0:47:20| he and I had regarding this particular metric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2840)|
| 0:47:25| So if Mr. Wilson, if you would just give us your thoughts on whether if we use the percentage of graduates deemed ready graduates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2845)|
| 0:47:35| and delete the last metric, if that would give us the feedback and the information that we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2855)|
| 0:47:43| Yeah. Thank you for the opportunity, Madam Chair and other board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2863)|
| 0:47:47| Yeah, that again, we've had a lot of discussion internally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2867)|
| 0:47:51| Steve Rutter and myself and then also with Miss Horn about kind of what was appropriate in terms of a CTE measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2871)|
| 0:47:58| And I would I would echo what you're saying. I think that using that ready graduate measure,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2878)|
| 0:48:03| because it is a matrix really that over that looks at all these different early post-secondary opportunities really does provide a snapshot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2883)|
| 0:48:11| When you think about holding, I guess, schools accountable for how they are serving their students and their community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2891)|
| 0:48:19| and opportunities for the students that they have, if you reduce it down to looking at the individual episodes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2899)|
| 0:48:25| So if we were to say, let's just track, did we increase AP course offerings or did we increase dual enrollment offerings?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2905)|
| 0:48:32| Industry certifications would be the same way. We could definitely promote practices that would drive those numbers up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2912)|
| 0:48:38| But that doesn't necessarily mean it would be the most valuable early post-secondary opportunity for the kids in that building and in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2918)|
| 0:48:46| And so when we think about it, I guess what I feel strongly about around the ready graduate indicator as being a good model is that it does require a conversation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2926)|
| 0:48:55| I think, at the school level to look at the students you serve and look at that community and make decisions about where are we missing opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2935)|
| 0:49:02| and where do we need to flesh out our programming more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| And so similarly, when you look at the metrics that are there, it seems right to me that we're not looking at dual enrollment specifically by itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2945)|
| 0:49:14| and AP specifically by itself. I think industry certifications really should be looked at in that same vein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2954)|
| 0:49:20| In addition to that, it's something that we're very subject to the state in terms of what gets approved to be an aligned industry certification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2960)|
| 0:49:29| And that's a catalog that changes annually. And so I hear different things and you never know what the future holds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2969)|
| 0:49:36| But I've heard that they're going to expand this catalog of industry certifications and I've heard that it may be reduced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2976)|
| 0:49:42| And so that's something to keep in mind, too, when you start trying to set percentages of graduates that would increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2982)|
| 0:49:48| That's really setting a goal for the whole student population. And what we know is that every kid doesn't take a CTE course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2988)|
| 0:49:54| And that's unlikely to change in the near future. When we think about quality CTE programming, it should be providing a deep dive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=2994)|
| 0:50:02| a sequence of courses for students. And we don't, in my mind, again, want to build a notion that we need to offer just CTE classes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3002)|
| 0:50:10| that have an industry certification and promote as many kids into those electives as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3010)|
| 0:50:15| That's really not the spirit of what you do with a CTE program in terms of providing a quality program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3015)|
| 0:50:21| So just those, as we're thinking about a metric, I want to have a metric that really promotes practice at the building level| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3021)|
| 0:50:28| that I think really fits the spirit of what Ready! Graduate's about and why we're pushing for industry certifications anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3028)|
| 0:50:34| OK, thank you. And Mr. Thomas and I have talked about having, looking at each specific individual high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3034)|
| 0:50:42| to be sure that they are addressing their community with offerings that will promote Ready! Graduates for that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3042)|
| 0:50:50| So those were really the three areas that we had questions on that were kind of outstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3050)|
| 0:51:00| And so beyond that, I'll just see what other information board members would like to offer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3060)|
| 0:51:06| All right. And just for clarification, so this will be rolled into Ready! Graduate. That will be totally eliminated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3066)|
| 0:51:15| Correct. So I will make a motion next week that we delete that fourth metric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3075)|
| 0:51:20| and that information will actually be presented to us as part of the Ready! Graduates| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3080)|
| 0:51:27| so that we will be receiving reports on Ready! Graduates, which will include all of those different aspects that are listed below.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3087)|
| 0:51:37| All of those things are broken down below in those bullets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| So we will be, they will report back to us on those things. It will just be as a total.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3101)|
| 0:51:47| I appreciate that Mr. Wilson does not want schools trying to hit certain numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3107)|
| 0:51:53| which may mean that they're offering classes that are not appropriate for their student body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| So I think that this makes the most sense. Thank you. Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3118)|
| 0:52:05| Yes, I liked Mr. Wilson's explanation about really, it sounds like what we need to do is figure out what is the right thing for the child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3125)|
| 0:52:12| But along those lines, too, and I'm not sure maybe how we measure it or if it's measurements that we include in this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3132)|
| 0:52:18| While this is going on, it sounds like we are trying to move that there are actually truly pathways to certifications| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3138)|
| 0:52:24| versus just random CTE courses that are really not leading our kids to anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3144)|
| 0:52:30| And I feel like we've talked as a board, or it sounds like there are a lot of discussions that we want to move that way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3150)|
| 0:52:35| but it doesn't sound like we're actually having metrics for it. And maybe it's not appropriate here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3155)|
| 0:52:41| but I do feel like we need to have some sense as a board moving forward that we are going deep at these schools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3161)|
| 0:52:48| depending on what the schools need. But I don't know necessarily that that last point is what we're looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3168)|
| 0:52:57| All right. Mr. Thomas, did you have any comment about that? All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3177)|
| 0:53:03| Yeah, well, in executive team meetings, we've talked about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3183)|
| 0:53:08| And also Dr. Reiswick and the research team, Steve Rutter, looking at each high school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3188)|
| 0:53:14| and what EPSOs are available in the way of advanced placement courses, dual credit, industry certifications,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3194)|
| 0:53:26| even looking at the military test, we're looking at all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3206)|
| 0:53:29| But just to make sure that every child has a large number of opportunities, you may not, we want everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3209)|
| 0:53:37| I'll say this again, to score a 21 and above, preferably being 36 is on the ACT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3217)|
| 0:53:43| But in lieu of that, to become a ready graduate, there are other ways to get there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3223)|
| 0:53:49| So are we making sure that our high schools are providing enough opportunities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3229)|
| 0:53:54| and variety of opportunities in order to get there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3234)|
| 0:53:57| So to make sure, looking at all of our schools, they're equitable in the way that those opportunities are being provided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3237)|
| 0:54:05| So I think even tomorrow, Mr. Trent's even scheduled, I believe, and Steve Rutter to talk to high school principals about that information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3245)|
| 0:54:15| And we can get that out to the board as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3258)|
| 0:54:20| That'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3260)|
| 0:54:21| That'd be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3261)|
| 0:54:22| Ms. Allen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3262)|
| 0:54:25| Somehow I missed seeing this as I was looking at it earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3265)|
| 0:54:29| I also miss, I miss seeing the languages that are spoken in Knox County schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3269)|
| 0:54:35| I think that's very valuable, and lots of people are really surprised by the languages that are spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3275)|
| 0:54:40| And that's not here in this schools at a glance section anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3280)|
| 0:54:44| I'd love to add that back if we could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3284)|
| 0:54:51| Is it anywhere in there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3291)|
| 0:54:52| That's a good catch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3292)|
| 0:54:53| Lots of people comment on that, that it's really surprising the number of languages spoken.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3293)|
| 0:54:59| So I think that's valuable information to have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3302)|
| 0:55:03| Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3303)|
| 0:55:04| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3304)|
| 0:55:05| I think you wanted to address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3305)|
| 0:55:06| Yes, go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3306)|
| 0:55:07| I have two other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3307)|
| 0:55:08| Yes, we're glad to get that, put that information in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3308)|
| 0:55:10| And as Ms. Allen was talking, it reminded me, I think we need to check our budget number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3310)|
| 0:55:15| I believe it's $485.1 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3315)|
| 0:55:18| I think $484.5 is listed here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3318)|
| 0:55:22| So if the board's okay with that, we'll make sure that the correct budget number is there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3322)|
| 0:55:31| Ms. Allen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3331)|
| 0:55:32| The next thing, I just want to note that I definitely agree with moving or removing the last metric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3332)|
| 0:55:39| for ready graduates because that also makes it match better with the evaluation tool| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3339)|
| 0:55:44| and put that all together and that works very nicely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3344)|
| 0:55:47| And the last thing, we're still looking at five columns of data in the metrics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3347)|
| 0:55:53| but it's really only three years because we have our baseline and then we have this year that we're in now,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3353)|
| 0:56:00| but we just have three years and we need to have five.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3360)|
| 0:56:03| So if we could stretch that out two more years unless we want to stay in here somewhere| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3363)|
| 0:56:10| that we are going to do that later because it is a five-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3370)|
| 0:56:14| so we should have those five-year metrics, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3374)|
| 0:56:22| I see what you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3382)|
| 0:56:26| We might have to have Ms. Coatney to play with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3386)|
| 0:56:32| Or Steve?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3392)|
| 0:56:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3393)|
| 0:56:34| As far as the formatting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3394)|
| 0:56:36| Yeah, he would need to provide the metrics to Terry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3396)|
| 0:56:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3404)|
| 0:56:45| I'm with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3405)|
| 0:56:46| That would be great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3406)|
| 0:56:47| She can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3407)|
| 0:56:48| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3408)|
| 0:56:51| Ms. Terry, we're talking about you if you're watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3411)|
| 0:56:55| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3415)|
| 0:56:57| Well, I want to thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3417)|
| 0:56:59| Board Member Babb, are you still on the metrics?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3419)|
| 0:57:01| Because I'm going to take it to a different direction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3421)|
| 0:57:04| Well, I guess a little bit, like Ms. Owens kind of was jumping around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| and I've got things in different spots, so I didn't know if we wanted each of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3427)|
| 0:57:12| It's more within the metric part that I have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3432)|
| 0:57:16| I just didn't know how we wanted to address it because I do have several things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3436)|
| 0:57:20| but they're kind of all over the place, and I didn't know if we wanted me to bring them up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3440)|
| 0:57:24| or if we were going to go through sections of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3444)|
| 0:57:29| Since it appears that we have quite a bit of dialogue on this, I will back up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3449)|
| 0:57:36| and we will go section by section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3456)|
| 0:57:38| Is that okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3458)|
| 0:57:39| Oh, absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3459)|
| 0:57:40| I didn't know what type of feedback we might be getting on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3460)|
| 0:57:44| And it's not lots, but mine are kind of in different spots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3464)|
| 0:57:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3467)|
| 0:57:48| Just to start from the first page, okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3468)|
| 0:57:55| Everybody good with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3475)|
| 0:57:57| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3477)|
| 0:57:59| Looking at the second page, the actual brochure right now is what I'm looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3479)|
| 0:58:12| But we do need to line it up with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3492)|
| 0:58:17| And this does not have page numbers on it, so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3497)|
| 0:58:27| For conversation, let's go ahead and go into the first goal, increasing student achievement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3507)|
| 0:58:34| And then this broke down into the different proficiencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3514)|
| 0:58:38| Did we have more conversation on that section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3518)|
| 0:58:47| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3527)|
| 0:58:48| Moving along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3528)|
| 0:58:49| And I know Ms. Satterfield has some comments on the eliminating disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3529)|
| 0:58:55| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3535)|
| 0:58:57| Board members, if you can locate the document on your notes that says Strategic Plan 2019-2024,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3537)|
| 0:59:06| because this is what I'll go by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3546)|
| 0:59:10| Perfect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3550)|
| 0:59:11| So after we released this document to the public, we received some feedback on making sure that we have language| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3551)|
| 0:59:20| on the eliminating disparities part that holds the board accountable to make sure that we are eliminating disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3560)|
| 0:59:26| When we were in the Strategic Plan Committee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3566)|
| 0:59:29| we had a lot of conversation about what direction do we want to go with making it so limited to the certain programs| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3569)|
| 0:59:39| that we've had in the past, because in the next three to five years, if something comes up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3579)|
| 0:59:43| do we have room to move into a new direction with the idea of still maintaining that we're eliminating disparities?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3583)|
| 0:59:50| And so with that, that's how we got to the point of removing the language of cultural competency, PBIS, and restorative justice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3590)|
| 0:59:57| However, given the feedback that we received from the community, I think we, that I received from the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3597)|
| 1:00:04| I think what I'm about to present can kind of give a middle ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3604)|
| 1:00:08| And so the first one, so I'm looking at the first bullets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3608)|
| 1:00:12| The bullets under provide student support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3612)|
| 1:00:14| So if you look at the second bullet where it says equip educators with resources, tools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3614)|
| 1:00:19| and training to build strong relationships with students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3619)|
| 1:00:24| I would like to propose that we change that language to equip educators and align resources, tools,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3624)|
| 1:00:31| and training to be culturally responsive, build positive relationships, and reflect the diverse needs of all students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3631)|
| 1:00:40| So that's the first recommendations, and I can get this to whoever needs to so they can add it there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3640)|
| 1:00:44| But feel free to ask any questions moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3644)|
| 1:00:48| The next bullet, which is bullet number three under provide student supports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3648)|
| 1:00:53| Originally it reads provide training for all staff in adverse childhood experiences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3653)|
| 1:00:59| I propose that we change it to provide training for all staff in adverse childhood experiences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3659)|
| 1:01:07| monitor progress, and refine best practices of behavior support systems to address specific needs, specific to the needs of the school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3667)|
| 1:01:18| Behavior support systems may include, but not limited to, ACEs, PPIS, restorative practices, and cultural competencies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3678)|
| 1:01:29| Again, speaking to that, it gives the flexibility of the schools to identify what's best for their school population,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3689)|
| 1:01:38| versus a top-down approach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3698)|
| 1:01:41| And then the third change that I recommend is the last bullet in that section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3701)|
| 1:01:45| It says engage our whole school community to prevent and respond to bullying based on research and evidence-based practice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3705)|
| 1:01:54| effective pedagogy, and strong partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3714)|
| 1:01:57| This is just a one-word change, which kind of aligns with the words mean things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3717)|
| 1:02:02| And so we're going to change it to engage, I recommend we change it to engage our whole school community to educate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3722)|
| 1:02:09| and respond to bullying-based research and evidence-based practices, effective pedagogy, and support partnerships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3729)|
| 1:02:16| If we had the magic bullet to prevent bullying, I think we would be all millionaires right now, but we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3736)|
| 1:02:22| So I think it's a matter of educating and responding accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3742)|
| 1:02:30| Mr. Doobler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3750)|
| 1:02:32| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3752)|
| 1:02:34| I had not spoken to Ms. Satterfield before she put out this sheet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3754)|
| 1:02:39| but I can tell you that our office would certainly recommend that these changes be made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3759)|
| 1:02:49| first because it does make the plan more consistent with previous correspondence from the board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3769)|
| 1:03:00| and more importantly, her third point aligns to the Tennessee Code Annotated Statute regarding harassment and bullying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3780)|
| 1:03:12| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3794)|
| 1:03:17| Any other questions or comments on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3797)|
| 1:03:23| This would be the next week we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3803)|
| 1:03:29| So I'm thinking without, did you want to respond to this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3809)|
| 1:03:34| It's not to hers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3814)|
| 1:03:36| I'm fine with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3816)|
| 1:03:37| It's kind of within this section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3817)|
| 1:03:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3818)|
| 1:03:39| Hold that one second, if you would, then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3819)|
| 1:03:42| Since I'm not hearing any objection, then we'll have staff go ahead and add this wording in before we vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3822)|
| 1:03:52| Yes, and I'll send it to Terry and Kay to get it through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3832)|
| 1:03:56| but there will be our wonderful Jennifer and Board Member Owen did see a grammar mistake,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3836)|
| 1:04:01| so we'll change that as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3841)|
| 1:04:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3843)|
| 1:04:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3844)|
| 1:04:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3845)|
| 1:04:06| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3846)|
| 1:04:07| Still in eliminating disparities, Ms. Babb.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3847)|
| 1:04:10| Yes, mine deal with the metrics, not the bullet points on the front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3850)|
| 1:04:16| Not the objectives, but getting into what we're measuring.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3856)|
| 1:04:21| And I guess if you go to this page that we have, under provide student support,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3861)|
| 1:04:27| the third one down is percentage of certified staff of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3867)|
| 1:04:32| I have no idea what that means, so I didn't know if there could be, maybe that's a term that is good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3872)|
| 1:04:39| To me, when we're talking about disparities, there's a lot of different things we're trying to measure with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3879)|
| 1:04:44| and I just didn't know what that term meant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3884)|
| 1:04:48| Does that make sense?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3888)|
| 1:04:55| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3895)|
| 1:04:57| I'm trying to find.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3897)|
| 1:05:04| Percentage of certified staff of color.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3904)|
| 1:05:06| I just think color is a very ambiguous word, and maybe it's not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3906)|
| 1:05:18| Well, I don't know what to say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3918)|
| 1:05:20| It appears to kind of be the terminology that is being used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3920)|
| 1:05:26| But I can't speak beyond that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3926)|
| 1:05:31| I guess my thing is, is that encompassing us trying to have a,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3931)|
| 1:05:38| because obviously what we're trying to do is, the thought behind this is trying to increase our diversity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3938)|
| 1:05:45| That's what we're trying to measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3945)|
| 1:05:47| I just didn't know if that terminology included the Hispanic population, African American population.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3947)|
| 1:05:53| That's what I wasn't really sure about with just the term color, so that was my question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3953)|
| 1:05:59| And then my other one is when we get down to improve student access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3959)|
| 1:06:04| we have over on the page before where we have improved student access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3964)|
| 1:06:10| One of the objectives is develop strategies to ensure student access to advance academic programs and career and technological.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3970)|
| 1:06:20| I don't think I'm, let me see.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3980)|
| 1:06:22| Oh, I'm sorry, it's the second bullet there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3982)|
| 1:06:24| Continue to review, evaluate, and strengthen special education services for students with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3984)|
| 1:06:30| So we're trying to improve their services, but what we're measuring is their out-of-school suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3990)|
| 1:06:36| And I don't know that, to me, that metric doesn't match what we're trying to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=3996)|
| 1:06:41| I mean, I think out-of-school suspensions we hope will help with academic, but that just doesn't seem to me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4001)|
| 1:06:47| and I'm not an academic, so that's where I'm kind of looking for some expertise here from people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4007)|
| 1:06:52| So that just does not seem like a good metric to me on that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4012)|
| 1:06:56| And then our third bullet was maintain and reinforce the KCS commitment to art education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4016)|
| 1:07:01| and we're not measuring that in any way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4021)|
| 1:07:04| So I also think there needs to be, if that's one of our objectives, we need to be measuring it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4024)|
| 1:07:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4031)|
| 1:07:14| Just a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4034)|
| 1:07:18| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4038)|
| 1:07:19| When we review, evaluate, and strengthen a service, any service,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4039)|
| 1:07:29| I'm wondering besides just making it a checked box that we did these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4049)|
| 1:07:38| do you have any recommendation on how it could be evaluated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4058)|
| 1:07:42| I don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4062)|
| 1:07:43| I actually probably, and maybe I should have had this conversation before, probably talking to special ed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4063)|
| 1:07:48| is if we're having a goal of doing this, I just don't feel like the metric is a very good match for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4068)|
| 1:08:02| Is Ms. Drennan here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4082)|
| 1:08:04| Could she maybe address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4084)|
| 1:08:09| And maybe the out-of-school suspensions does address that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4089)|
| 1:08:12| That's what I'm kind of trying to see if she might know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4092)|
| 1:08:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4098)|
| 1:08:19| So I guess when I look at this continue to review, evaluate, and strengthen special education services for students with disabilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4099)|
| 1:08:25| I would have a couple of comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4105)|
| 1:08:27| Number one, the progress that is reported on students with disabilities is really on an individual basis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4107)|
| 1:08:33| when you look at how their IEPs are implemented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| You can pull out growth data for the subgroup for students with disabilities, and we are monitored.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4116)|
| 1:08:43| We are currently monitored on that rubric by the State Department of Education,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4123)|
| 1:08:49| and it is part of our comprehensive plan that we have submitted for TN Ready.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4129)|
| 1:08:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4134)|
| 1:08:55| Well, I guess what then I'm asking is do you feel like the out-of-school suspension rate is then a good metric| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4135)|
| 1:09:02| to go back to what we're trying to do there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4142)|
| 1:09:13| So I guess I would say that I probably agree with your question that that might not be the best metric,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4153)|
| 1:09:19| but I'm going by what I'm interpreting this to mean.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4159)|
| 1:09:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4163)|
| 1:09:24| Again, services is a really broad when you talk about providing services to students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4164)|
| 1:09:30| because there's all types of different services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4170)|
| 1:09:32| The language becomes very technical when you're talking about students with disabilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4172)|
| 1:09:37| And I can imagine an easy metric in this subject is very hard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4177)|
| 1:09:40| because it's not just a TN Ready score or something like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4180)|
| 1:09:44| So I guess I'm struggling with it a little bit as to whether. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4184)|
| 1:09:48| I mean, I think we need to address the fact that we are improving things for our special ed population| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4188)|
| 1:09:54| is definitely an objective of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| I just worry that our metric is really not helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4196)|
| 1:10:00| When you look at the overall student access, when you think about access as an inclusion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4200)|
| 1:10:05| we monitor that as well as the State Department of Education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4205)|
| 1:10:08| And every school, every principal, when they pull up Easy IEP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4208)|
| 1:10:13| they can see on their front screen the level of students as measured by the State Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4213)|
| 1:10:19| and how many of those students are spending 80% or more of their time in the general education classroom,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4219)|
| 1:10:24| how many of those kids spend 40% or less time in the general education classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4224)|
| 1:10:29| That is a metric that we have access to, and we are currently measured by, again,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4229)|
| 1:10:34| by the Tennessee Department of Education because the feds monitor the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4234)|
| 1:10:38| So when you think about improving student access, that's also a metric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4238)|
| 1:10:42| So would that be a better metric to show that we're being successful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4242)|
| 1:10:45| I would think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4245)|
| 1:10:48| And if you look at our data over the past several years, we've improved in that area every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4248)|
| 1:10:53| I mean, that sounds like something we would want to continue to improve on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4253)|
| 1:10:56| Certainly. It's a targeted goal for us, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4256)|
| 1:10:59| I mean, I would suggest I think that would be a better metric to use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4259)|
| 1:11:03| And I don't know if there's someone that could craft the wording of that because I'm not an expertise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4263)|
| 1:11:09| But I think that would be better than just measuring the out-of-school suspension rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4269)|
| 1:11:14| Ms. Strinden, would you write just a bullet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4274)|
| 1:11:18| Sure. I'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| That would address the metric that you're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4281)|
| 1:11:25| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4285)|
| 1:11:28| And we can consider adding it under improved student access to be more relevant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4288)|
| 1:11:33| Yeah, I think just to take the place of out-of-school, unless we feel like we need to measure the out-of-school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4293)|
| 1:11:38| I mean, maybe we do need to measure the out-of-school suspensions, which we might need to because that is, maybe it needs to be an addition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4298)|
| 1:11:45| And I would support keeping that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4305)|
| 1:11:48| But I like your comment about perhaps using this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4308)|
| 1:11:51| Because I think they're measuring two different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4311)|
| 1:11:54| I agree.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4314)|
| 1:11:57| I think the measuring out-of-school suspensions almost goes back to our PBIS kind of training of staff on some other areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4317)|
| 1:12:03| And then, this is not probably Ms. Strinden, but also, do we feel like we need to have a metric on art education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4323)|
| 1:12:10| Or do you want to talk?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4330)|
| 1:12:13| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4333)|
| 1:12:16| While she's here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4336)|
| 1:12:19| Okay, I did have a question and I forgot it until we were having this conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4339)|
| 1:12:22| Under narrow achievement gaps, it says success rate in all tested subjects for students in the students with disabilities student group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4342)|
| 1:12:34| So, does that mean, when you read that, do you think it's on eliminating disparities on that metric page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4354)|
| 1:12:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| Under narrow achievement gaps and then the second metric on that second section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4365)|
| 1:12:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4371)|
| 1:12:54| It says success rate in all tested subjects for students in the students with disabilities student group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4374)|
| 1:12:59| So, when that says success rate, are you reading that as proficiency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4379)|
| 1:13:05| Or would that mean something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4385)|
| 1:13:11| Do you know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4391)|
| 1:13:14| Who generated that terminology?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4394)|
| 1:13:17| I guess I would need to refer that question back to that person.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4397)|
| 1:13:23| My understanding is, Dr. Roswick is indicating that someone on the board, whoever designed that metric, just tell me what that meant to them and then I can respond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4403)|
| 1:13:35| Yeah, I think that was maybe given to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4415)|
| 1:13:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4418)|
| 1:13:41| So, maybe, do you mind looking at that metric and just, we might need to change the way that's worded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4421)|
| 1:13:47| Because I don't know what that means either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4427)|
| 1:13:51| Because the committee did not review the metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4431)|
| 1:13:54| So, we have not had a discussion about the metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4434)|
| 1:13:57| So, I think we may just need to, it says success rate a few times there in that particular section.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4437)|
| 1:14:06| I think we probably just need to review that language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| So, my suggestion is maybe we consult with Dr. Roswick and the REA group to maybe design what that would look like and be a little bit more effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4449)|
| 1:14:16| I think that would be better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4456)|
| 1:14:19| I don't want to ask for something that is not something that you would already measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4459)|
| 1:14:25| So, we just need to make sure that that's the correct measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4465)|
| 1:14:28| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4468)|
| 1:14:31| Go ahead, Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4471)|
| 1:14:34| I was just going to say one place to start with might be the report card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4474)|
| 1:14:37| I want to say that the report card, the way it's broken down, refers to success rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4477)|
| 1:14:42| So, that may be where that came from.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4482)|
| 1:14:45| I'm not sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4485)|
| 1:14:48| We just need to make sure that it is something that you would be, you know, having,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4488)|
| 1:14:53| or that REA would have access to and make sense for special education.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4493)|
| 1:15:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4500)|
| 1:15:03| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4503)|
| 1:15:06| Mr. Thomas, perhaps you could, I mean, these metrics came from somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| Do you think all of this is off the metric of the state report card then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4509)|
| 1:15:14| I don't know that all of them are, but it just seemed like I remember when looking at the report card,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4514)|
| 1:15:19| it talked about the success rate, you know, different, but we'll follow up on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4519)|
| 1:15:24| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4524)|
| 1:15:25| I mean, these metrics from 2017-18 came from somewhere.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4525)|
| 1:15:30| And the numbers, I would almost bet it's tied somehow to our state reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4530)|
| 1:15:38| Mr. Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4538)|
| 1:15:40| Dr. Rouse, you've got some information maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4540)|
| 1:15:43| That's great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4543)|
| 1:15:44| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4544)|
| 1:15:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4545)|
| 1:15:46| No, I was actually looking at the other question when that was asked, so I couldn't find success rate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4546)|
| 1:15:49| But you're exactly right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4549)|
| 1:15:50| So, the success rate is kind of, there's a matrix of different data points that come out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4550)|
| 1:15:55| so that we get a success rate for every subgroup and the overall, that sort of thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4555)|
| 1:16:00| So, that is part of the state reporting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| It'll take things you kind of get the best of sometimes, absolute achievement versus growth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4562)|
| 1:16:07| versus those kinds of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4567)|
| 1:16:09| So, there's kind of a matrix you go across.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4569)|
| 1:16:10| And so, the state gives you different ways to hit that mark, and that's why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4570)|
| 1:16:14| and that's what you get your overall success rate for subgroups, schools, and overall districts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4574)|
| 1:16:18| So, that is a state terminology for that measurement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4578)|
| 1:16:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4581)|
| 1:16:22| So, this basically came right off our state report card.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4582)|
| 1:16:26| So, is everyone all right then if we just leave that as is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4586)|
| 1:16:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4591)|
| 1:16:32| Do we still want Ms. Strannon to address that bullet?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4592)|
| 1:16:38| Or are we going to just leave it since this is the state's wording?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4598)|
| 1:16:42| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4602)|
| 1:16:44| Yay for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4604)|
| 1:16:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4605)|
| 1:16:49| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4609)|
| 1:16:51| We're still looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4611)|
| 1:16:53| So, under the improved student access bullets, and this is more just a visual thing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4613)|
| 1:16:59| I do think those bottom two bullets that are there right now, they need to be flipped.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4619)|
| 1:17:04| I just think we need to match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| You know, this is, if you look at the first page of objectives, you've got three objectives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4627)|
| 1:17:11| and I think the metrics need to fall on the page matching the day before the page after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4631)|
| 1:17:16| But, you know, I'm looking at our objective on art education, and I'm not really sure how you do measure that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4636)|
| 1:17:23| I mean, it's basically we're kind of, we just want to be good about art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4643)|
| 1:17:28| But I do feel like if we're putting it in there, we need to have some way to measure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4648)|
| 1:17:32| Do you have any thoughts, Mr. Thomas, on if there are ways to measure arts education?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4652)|
| 1:17:40| I think we'll probably get together with staff and our research team| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4660)|
| 1:17:47| and talk about it and come up with a way that we can do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4667)|
| 1:17:51| Of course, you know, offerings is one way to make sure and ensure that the offerings are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4671)|
| 1:17:58| But also looking at the student enrollment might be another way to look.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4678)|
| 1:18:05| I mean, I don't want to make work and make up busy work to just have a metric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| So, I mean, I guess just to see if there is something meaningful,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4689)|
| 1:18:13| if we're going to have it as an objective in our strategic plan, how do we know five years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4693)|
| 1:18:18| And I guess that's how I would think about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4698)|
| 1:18:20| Five years from now, how do we know we're doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4700)|
| 1:18:23| I think it's a great point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4703)|
| 1:18:25| If we're going to have it there, there ought to be a way to know that we're doing what we're saying that we're doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4705)|
| 1:18:30| So, yeah, we'll look at that and try to come up with something for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4710)|
| 1:18:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4715)|
| 1:18:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4717)|
| 1:18:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4718)|
| 1:18:39| Good conversation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4719)|
| 1:18:41| Any other comments on the eliminating disparities section?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4721)|
| 1:18:50| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4730)|
| 1:18:51| Moving on to creating a positive culture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4731)|
| 1:18:58| Are there any questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4738)|
| 1:19:00| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4740)|
| 1:19:01| Ms. Babb, that's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| I had brought this up in our discussion the other day, but basically under exceptional place to work and learn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4743)|
| 1:19:08| one of the bullets is continue to evaluate and improve working and learning conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4748)|
| 1:19:12| which I think is very important, and I do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| But then when I look over at our metrics, we have kept it that we are basically talking to our teachers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| and I think there's a whole culture in our building beyond just our teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| So I would, and we had talked about adding, and I saw it somewhere else where we're going to add evaluation of,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4763)|
| 1:19:30| is it classified?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4770)|
| 1:19:31| I always want to get to terminology, the non-teachers, just classified staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4771)|
| 1:19:34| But it looks like we are developing a, we will be developing a survey to actually get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4774)|
| 1:19:40| But I do think creating a positive culture in our schools, I think we need to add the fact somehow that we're looking at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4780)|
| 1:19:48| how our classified staff feels also as a metric.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4788)|
| 1:19:54| And it might even be a percentage of teachers and classified staff, but I do think it's almost a difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4794)|
| 1:19:59| I mean, you could have the teachers that feel it is a fabulous culture that's going on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4799)|
| 1:20:04| and it is not that same culture for the classified staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4808)|
| 1:20:14| Ms. Owen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4814)|
| 1:20:16| Since we discussed that in our evaluation tool, also, that would be a baseline score since that would be a new tool,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4816)|
| 1:20:23| a new survey, and so that would not have a goal number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4823)|
| 1:20:27| So that would be added in as a baseline score if we wanted to add that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4827)|
| 1:20:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4831)|
| 1:20:32| In the future years, we could see that we're wanting to go up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4832)|
| 1:20:34| Good point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4834)|
| 1:20:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4835)|
| 1:20:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4839)|
| 1:20:40| Any other comments on creating a positive culture?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4840)|
| 1:20:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4851)|
| 1:20:53| And I'm looking at the back page for Mr. Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4853)|
| 1:20:59| Good job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4859)|
| 1:21:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4866)|
| 1:21:07| Taking some of these suggestions under consideration, is there anything else that anyone would like to add to the strategic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4867)|
| 1:21:20| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4880)|
| 1:21:21| Madam Chair, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4881)|
| 1:21:23| I know Ms. Good has taken good notes, so perhaps we can compile all of these,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4883)|
| 1:21:30| and if it's okay with the Board, go ahead and send out a revised copy prior to our meeting next Wednesday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4890)|
| 1:21:37| so that we can make a motion to approve the revised copy, if that would be agreeable to the Board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4897)|
| 1:21:45| Madam Chair, thank you, Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4905)|
| 1:21:47| And I saw you taking some pretty good notes there, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4907)|
| 1:21:50| I think I have some notes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| Perhaps you could talk with Ms. Good and be all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| I know that would be helpful to her also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4915)|
| 1:22:00| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4920)|
| 1:22:01| Anything else on the strategic plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4921)|
| 1:22:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4924)|
| 1:22:06| Before we move into public forum, Mr. Norman, you had asked for a discussion on certified employees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4926)|
| 1:22:15| Before you begin, is everyone all right if we push on through, or do we need a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4935)|
| 1:22:21| We have this one item and then four for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4941)|
| 1:22:25| Do you want a break?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4945)|
| 1:22:30| I knocked my glass over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4950)|
| 1:22:34| No, I'm good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4954)|
| 1:22:35| I'm ready if people are ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| This won't take that long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4957)|
| 1:22:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4959)|
| 1:22:40| Go ahead, Mr. Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4960)|
| 1:22:41| Then I'm going with consensus here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4961)|
| 1:22:43| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4963)|
| 1:22:44| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4964)|
| 1:22:47| First, I want to say this has got a little history, of course, in terms of, for a long time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4967)|
| 1:22:55| we've talked about how to get more money to the teachers in the classroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4975)|
| 1:23:03| So certainly Gary Spencer and Joe Snyder have accommodated me more than once| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4983)|
| 1:23:11| when we'd have discussions about this and past budget meetings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4991)|
| 1:23:18| So I'm still sort of after that goal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=4998)|
| 1:23:21| So how can we do this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5001)|
| 1:23:23| Well, to me, one of the things that takes place that probably inhibits that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5003)|
| 1:23:31| is that every certified employee is basically in one group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5011)|
| 1:23:38| And so we've talked about, or I've talked about this to Gary and Joe and how to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5018)|
| 1:23:49| maybe possibly how to differentiate between certified employees based on their job,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5029)|
| 1:23:58| based on what they do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5038)|
| 1:24:00| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5040)|
| 1:24:05| And I haven't been so efficient as Ed that he had written it all down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5045)|
| 1:24:10| and have it ready to go for everybody to look at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5050)|
| 1:24:14| But I will, and first, before I get started, I want to apologize to Ron.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5054)|
| 1:24:19| Ron doesn't have enough to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5059)|
| 1:24:24| So what I would like to do is work up kind of an outline of what we might do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5064)|
| 1:24:32| hypothetically, within the certified category such that we've got categories of certified people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5072)|
| 1:24:43| One category, say, would get a 4% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5083)|
| 1:24:48| Another category would get a 3% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5088)|
| 1:24:52| Another category would get a 2% raise, and so on, 1% raise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5092)|
| 1:24:57| And so that's kind of the sketch outline of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5097)|
| 1:25:03| And so I'll put this in a document, and I'll send it to Ron, and I'll send it to all the board members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5103)|
| 1:25:12| But that's the idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5112)|
| 1:25:14| So with the emphasis, of course, being on the classroom teacher.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5114)|
| 1:25:20| That's where the biggest raise would go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5120)|
| 1:25:23| And then sort of based on the amount of contact with students, direct contact with students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5123)|
| 1:25:33| would be sort of the basis for the different categories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5133)|
| 1:25:38| So anyway, that's what I'll do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5138)|
| 1:25:40| And if you all would like to talk more about it or ask questions, fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5140)|
| 1:25:45| That's my idea.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5145)|
| 1:25:47| That's what I'm going to throw at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5147)|
| 1:25:55| Any comments, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5155)|
| 1:25:58| I appreciate you talking about that, Tony, because I know we all definitely want to get as much increase as we can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5158)|
| 1:26:13| I'm certainly open for discussion, and I know sometimes that gets very sticky in a hurry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5173)|
| 1:26:18| because we have so many support people, support certified people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5178)|
| 1:26:25| that even within their categories might have different jobs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5185)|
| 1:26:30| Some of them might be classroom assigned 90% of the time,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5190)|
| 1:26:36| and the same role in another school might only be direct student service 10% of the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5196)|
| 1:26:43| We get into things like our guidance counselors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5203)|
| 1:26:47| Some of them are purely administrative.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5207)|
| 1:26:50| Some of them are in the classroom all the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5210)|
| 1:26:54| You get into school psychologists and speech and language.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5214)|
| 1:26:58| But I just say all that to say that it could prove to be challenging, but I certainly, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5218)|
| 1:27:12| I think we are all open to entertaining anything that we feel like would be equitable for sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5232)|
| 1:27:18| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5238)|
| 1:27:19| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5239)|
| 1:27:21| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5241)|
| 1:27:23| Without any more comments, questions, we'll move into public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| Ms. Horne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5248)|
| 1:27:29| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5249)|
| 1:27:31| We have our first speaker is Todd Shelton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5251)|
| 1:27:39| Just a reminder for all our public speakers, if you would let us know your name and county of residence, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5259)|
| 1:27:46| Go ahead, Mr. Shelton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5266)|
| 1:27:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5268)|
| 1:27:49| Todd Shelton is my name, and I live in South Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5269)|
| 1:27:54| My kids all went to school and graduated there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5274)|
| 1:28:00| I want to thank you all for all the work you've been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5280)|
| 1:28:04| I think about when you took on these duties and then you found out just how much you have to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5284)|
| 1:28:10| We appreciate your energy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5290)|
| 1:28:13| And I also want to thank you for valuing the public forum, and I hope you will continue to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5293)|
| 1:28:20| My thoughts today are about, and I'm also representing Stop School Pushout| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5300)|
| 1:28:26| and a coalition of groups that have gotten together to support you all in trying to provide good education for our kids.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5306)|
| 1:28:37| My thoughts today are about the completion of the new strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5317)|
| 1:28:41| I'm focusing on the cultural competency training provided to teachers and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5321)|
| 1:28:50| Actually, you all corrected some of what I was suggesting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5330)|
| 1:28:54| I'll go ahead and go through this because I may have missed some of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5334)|
| 1:28:58| But we know that the DEO Task Force recommended this, and it was approved by the Board of Directors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5338)|
| 1:29:06| My concern is that it is referred to indirectly in the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5346)|
| 1:29:12| I, however, was happy to see the exact wording in the metrics where it just came out a few days ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5352)|
| 1:29:19| We feel it needs to be out front in the narrative, and several comments were made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5359)|
| 1:29:25| Our suggestions were that under the second section, and this has to do with the eliminating disparities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5365)|
| 1:29:34| bullet two, that it be changed to fund and equip educators with resources, for instance, such as more supportive staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5374)|
| 1:29:45| tools and training such as PBS, restorative practice, and cultural diversity training to build strong relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5385)|
| 1:29:54| with all the students, including those from marginalized environments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5394)|
| 1:30:00| And I think all of you all have a copy of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5400)|
| 1:30:02| I tried to send it to you so you can check me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5402)|
| 1:30:06| And by the way, we feel, and this is something I think is special that we forget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5406)|
| 1:30:12| that there are many students who are scholastically proficient but will also| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5412)|
| 1:30:18| and can also use the influences of these practices, such as restorative practices, PBIS, and cultural competency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5418)|
| 1:30:28| It's not restricted to marginalized communities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5428)|
| 1:30:32| So it's important, I think, for us to remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5432)|
| 1:30:35| Under part two, again, bullet six, we suggest that we retain experienced and trained educators| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5435)|
| 1:30:44| in PBIS, restorative practices, and cultural competency training at high-need schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5444)|
| 1:30:52| I will say again how important teacher training in these three areas, the PBIS, cultural competency,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5452)|
| 1:31:00| and restorative practices are to the teachers and the support staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5460)|
| 1:31:07| and the extra support staff that sometimes is needed to follow through what has been learned from these trainings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5467)|
| 1:31:18| Sometimes it means some more supportive staff so that the classroom teacher can make good use of the training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5478)|
| 1:31:26| My experience with cultural competency training has been valuable to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5486)|
| 1:31:31| in my experience with school-age children as well as adults in my community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5491)|
| 1:31:37| I could go to a training tomorrow, and I would end up coming up and find some new perception that I had missed before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5497)|
| 1:31:49| I don't think there's ever enough of this training, and it's very healthy for all of us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5509)|
| 1:31:56| We have heard some folks complain about it, but we have heard many folks say how enlightening it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5516)|
| 1:32:01| and they can see how important it can be in their teachings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5521)|
| 1:32:07| I was going to add the discussion that you all had just now under eliminating disparities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5527)|
| 1:32:15| under narrowing achievement gaps, the bullet, I guess, the second and the third bullet in there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5535)|
| 1:32:28| I thought those were very good questions, and I hadn't seen them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5548)|
| 1:32:32| but I had noticed that the, in bullet three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5552)|
| 1:32:36| continue to invest in the professional growth and support of all educators by offering training and learning opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5556)|
| 1:32:43| I felt like there was some relevancy there, only if we include, you know, additional support staff and offering training.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5563)|
| 1:32:53| Thank you, Mr. Shelton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5573)|
| 1:32:59| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5579)|
| 1:33:00| And I would just end by saying if you make a budget to ask for what the Knox County School needs without cuts,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5580)|
| 1:33:08| then we will all support you all the way through the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5588)|
| 1:33:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5591)|
| 1:33:12| Mr. Gibson, Gordon Gibson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5592)|
| 1:33:23| I'm Gordon Gibson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5603)|
| 1:33:24| I live in East Knoxville, represented by Ms. Satterfield.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5604)|
| 1:33:30| You can tell by the shirt that Todd and I have bumped into each other before.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5610)|
| 1:33:36| I want to thank you all very much for doing some hard work on the strategic plan over a period of months,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5616)|
| 1:33:49| both board and staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| I think what you're looking at today is a much improved document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5632)|
| 1:33:56| I'm really pleased to see you continuing to work to fine tune it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5636)|
| 1:34:02| Yes, you could probably do this for months on end, but, okay, you've reached a pretty good point, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5642)|
| 1:34:12| I would hold up one thing in the current metrics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5652)|
| 1:34:22| I'm very pleased to see some serious changes in the percentage of Black, Hispanic, Native American students| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5662)|
| 1:34:34| who have at least one out-of-school suspension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5674)|
| 1:34:39| This is something that the Disparities in Educational Outcomes Task Force looked at, raised great concerns about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5679)|
| 1:34:49| and, yes, it's very important that those numbers go down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5689)|
| 1:34:54| It's also important that the disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5694)|
| 1:34:59| I attended the meeting at which staff reported on the change in out-of-school and in-school suspensions that happened,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5699)|
| 1:35:12| and I was concerned that although the numbers had gone down for both students of color and white students,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5712)|
| 1:35:22| both special needs students and other students, that there were still disparities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5722)|
| 1:35:30| So whether or not it's included as a metric in the strategic plan, that is something that you need to work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5730)|
| 1:35:42| over the next three years, five years, whatever the span is here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5742)|
| 1:35:49| And we all realize this takes money, and you are facing scary money numbers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5749)|
| 1:36:03| which just this week got scarier because the governor is apparently playing games with BEP funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5763)|
| 1:36:14| It is important, I believe, like Todd, that as you approach funding, you figure out what our school system needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5774)|
| 1:36:31| What do we need to support our students?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5791)|
| 1:36:36| And that you ask for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5796)|
| 1:36:39| It's not your job to figure out, well, they never give us this, so we won't ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5799)|
| 1:36:48| Ask for what we need in our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5808)|
| 1:36:52| We will back you up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5812)|
| 1:36:55| I remember last year when it looked like you were going to have to whack the daylights out of some important programs,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5815)|
| 1:37:05| and this room overflowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| I was one of the ones stuck outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5828)|
| 1:37:11| And I think that will happen again if the school system is denied what it needs in order to function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5831)|
| 1:37:21| Thank you for your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5841)|
| 1:37:25| Thank you, Mr. Gibson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5845)|
| 1:37:26| Lance McCold is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5846)|
| 1:37:33| Lance McCold, Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5853)|
| 1:37:35| Before I speak, could I get someone to hand this out to the board?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5855)|
| 1:37:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5865)|
| 1:37:49| Madam Chair, members of the board, thank you for giving me a few minutes of your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5869)|
| 1:37:53| I want to thank you for making transparency and program evaluation and budgeting a part of the strategic plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5873)|
| 1:38:00| Nothing builds trust more than transparency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5880)|
| 1:38:04| You don't have to agree with people, but if you know where they're coming from, you can trust them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5884)|
| 1:38:08| As a community learns about that the board and staff are consistently open and honest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5888)|
| 1:38:14| you'll find even more support for the board and our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5894)|
| 1:38:20| This board and the staff deserve a lot of appreciation for increased transparency around budget this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5900)|
| 1:38:28| The March 7th community meeting was a highlight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5908)|
| 1:38:31| I believe that transparency on budgeting will pay off for our schools now and into the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5911)|
| 1:38:39| Thanks to the transparency of staff, the community is gaining a clear idea why Knox County schools will need more money next school year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5919)|
| 1:38:50| At this time, I'd refer you to the sheet that I handed out needed 2019-2020 Knox County school funding increases that I asked you to share with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5930)|
| 1:39:00| The document is a summary of information provided by the staff that's been organized to make it easier to understand our school's funding needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5940)|
| 1:39:10| Let me draw your attention to the non-discriminatory category amounting to about $19 million increase.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5950)|
| 1:39:19| Most of the non-discretionary items are either existing legal or financial commitments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5959)|
| 1:39:26| primarily those listed under fixed increases and employee benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5966)|
| 1:39:31| Note that none of these items is an enhancement of anything the schools are doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5971)|
| 1:39:36| They are just the cost of carrying on the current program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5976)|
| 1:39:40| Discussing the items in this category with staff, I'm confident that each has a very solid foundation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5980)|
| 1:39:48| Similarly, the critical student needs are simply the cost of carrying out our school's responsibility to English language learners and to students with special needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5988)|
| 1:39:58| Likewise, there's nothing optional about providing our students with textbooks, books that are aligned with state standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=5998)|
| 1:40:05| The community can clearly see that there is nothing frivolous or wasteful in these items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6005)|
| 1:40:12| At $14.5 million, the salary enhancement area is the second largest category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6012)|
| 1:40:19| The board knows well why these raises are essential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6019)|
| 1:40:22| The community knows that teachers are the heart of the schools and the community understands that if we don't pay teachers adequately,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6022)|
| 1:40:28| we will continue losing them to other districts and other kinds of work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6028)|
| 1:40:33| All this is to say that staff has built an extremely solid case for the necessity of about $32 million, by my accounting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6033)|
| 1:40:41| of essential spending increases over this year for next year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6041)|
| 1:40:47| Of course, we know that the board has no power to raise funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6047)|
| 1:40:52| Nearly all KCS operating funds come from the state and county governments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6052)|
| 1:40:57| This board's role, indeed its obligation, is to figure out how much money our schools need and to ask for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6057)|
| 1:41:04| The community is counting on you to advocate for the funds our schools need to support our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6064)|
| 1:41:09| I'm confident that the community will support you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6069)|
| 1:41:12| Certainly, I promise you to do my personal best to support your work for the funds our schools need to support our students.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6072)|
| 1:41:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6082)|
| 1:41:24| Thank you, Lance. We appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6084)|
| 1:41:27| And Mr. Wheeler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6087)|
| 1:41:32| Mr. Wheeler is our final speaker tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6092)|
| 1:41:38| Does that mean I'd be the best speaker or does that mean the what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6098)|
| 1:41:43| The best for last, Carl.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6103)|
| 1:41:46| First of all, let me thank you, Madam Chair and the board members, for allowing us, including myself,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6106)|
| 1:41:54| to present to you a little different perspective that I'm sure you're cognizant of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6114)|
| 1:42:02| I intended to talk about, in terms of this document we're working on, I wanted to talk about teachers in terms of the adequacy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6122)|
| 1:42:16| Do we have enough? Where do we not have enough?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6136)|
| 1:42:20| Where do we need to present and put our efforts to increase our teacher size or capacity to what we need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6140)|
| 1:42:30| As Lance said, we want you to put together a plan, a financial plan, that produces what you think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6150)|
| 1:42:40| what the community thinks is needed for our school system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6160)|
| 1:42:45| One of those elements, of course, is teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6165)|
| 1:42:48| I looked at some data a couple years ago, a year and a half ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| that showed that the school board had been challenged with a number of departures in terms of teachers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6172)|
| 1:43:04| and challenges to replace those teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6184)|
| 1:43:09| And we all know why that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6189)|
| 1:43:12| We may not say it out loud, but we know that it's a money thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6192)|
| 1:43:17| People follow the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6197)|
| 1:43:19| So I did see a presentation that one of the staff members did for this upcoming year, let's say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6199)|
| 1:43:27| And I'm sure you guys are implementing that plan now, which will bring forth, hopefully, new teachers to fill the gaps that we have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6207)|
| 1:43:36| And I encourage you to keep doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6216)|
| 1:43:38| That presentation was an excellent presentation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6218)|
| 1:43:41| And by my standards, if you was to follow that, you would meet your goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6221)|
| 1:43:46| And I think that's what we're all looking for, to meet our goals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| So having said that, I'm not going to spend a whole lot more time up here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| but I am going to suggest that after listening to some additional comments on this plan, the strategic plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6234)|
| 1:44:03| it seems to me that there needs to be some more gathering around the table, so to speak,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6243)|
| 1:44:10| to fine tune these things and get the marks and the words and the matrix the way we want them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6250)|
| 1:44:19| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6259)|
| 1:44:20| So I would encourage you that whenever you do this, allow the public to come in and say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6260)|
| 1:44:30| Get some feedback from the public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6270)|
| 1:44:31| I know you get a lot of that now, probably more than you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6271)|
| 1:44:34| But we want the same thing that you want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6274)|
| 1:44:39| And that's the best for our children, the best education they can get out of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6279)|
| 1:44:44| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6284)|
| 1:44:45| And that's for all children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6285)|
| 1:44:46| Doesn't matter shades, color, whether they're challenged physically or mentally,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6286)|
| 1:44:53| they all should get the best we can provide for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6293)|
| 1:44:56| So I encourage you to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6296)|
| 1:44:58| And I thank you for allowing me to have this moment to speak to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6298)|
| 1:45:03| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6303)|
| 1:45:04| Thank you, Mr. Wheeler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6304)|
| 1:45:05| And, Madam Chair, that concludes public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6305)|
| 1:45:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6307)|
| 1:45:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6308)|
| 1:45:10| And we'll move on now to board forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6310)|
| 1:45:13| Ms. Satterfield?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6313)|
| 1:45:17| Nothing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6317)|
| 1:45:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6318)|
| 1:45:19| Ms. Owen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6319)|
| 1:45:24| Since we are discussing money, I would like to note some numbers that currently exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6324)|
| 1:45:32| While we could ask for money that does not exist, that doesn't seem very sensible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6332)|
| 1:45:38| We know that money does exist at the state level, but that it's being used for other purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6338)|
| 1:45:45| And looking only at the voucher bill in its current form, with a cap at year five of 15,000 students per year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6345)|
| 1:46:01| we will come up with $365 million spent on this program by the fifth year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6361)|
| 1:46:09| So that is a very significant amount that we are looking at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6369)|
| 1:46:15| But we need to very carefully consider where the state is choosing to put money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6375)|
| 1:46:24| and it would be extremely helpful if our community would speak with legislators about the money that is there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6384)|
| 1:46:32| instead of the money that is not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6392)|
| 1:46:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6395)|
| 1:46:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6397)|
| 1:46:38| Mr. Norman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6398)|
| 1:46:39| Mine's a little happier than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6399)|
| 1:46:44| So congratulations to the Bearden Boys basketball team for their state championship.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6404)|
| 1:46:51| And that's an incredible thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6411)|
| 1:46:54| Those guys will talk about that when they're 65 years old and meeting down at Buddy's or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6414)|
| 1:47:02| So that's a great thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6422)|
| 1:47:04| So congratulations to them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6424)|
| 1:47:07| Also, the board will be noticed that the Halls Outdoor Classroom Annual Picnic Get Together Blah Blah Blah is April 16th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6427)|
| 1:47:19| So you all get noticed on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6439)|

| 1:47:49| Thank you, Madam Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6469)|
| 1:47:50| I just wanted to, you know, we get to the end of the year and everybody gets a little tired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6470)|
| 1:47:55| So I just want to thank the staff and our teachers and everybody in our schools who are working so hard to finish the year strong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6475)|
| 1:48:02| And I also wanted to say I appreciate Mr. McPherson and his team going over with the mayor to meet with the governor last week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6482)|
| 1:48:11| I appreciate the mayor advocating for our school system and for what resources we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6491)|
| 1:48:16| And so I just wanted to extend my thanks for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6496)|

| 1:48:22| Ms. Babb?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6502)|
| 1:48:23| A couple things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| I would like to kind of follow up with Ms. Owens' comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6504)|
| 1:48:27| You know, I'm very troubled about what's going on right now with the ESA and voucher bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6507)|
| 1:48:31| And I think even if someone supports vouchers, I hope that they will seriously read this legislation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6511)|
| 1:48:39| and see some of the problems that we're seeing with it and contact their legislators.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6519)|
| 1:48:44| But on a happier note, my district is really taking over downtown on Friday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6524)|
| 1:48:49| Bearden Elementary School is going to have an art display at the Bijou Theater.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6529)|
| 1:48:54| And the West APIB art students are going to have a display Friday night at the Miller Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6534)|
| 1:49:02| That's going to be Friday and Saturday night.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6542)|
| 1:49:04| And then Sequoia Elementary, right around the corner at the Standard, is having a fundraiser.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6544)|
| 1:49:08| So I think I'm just going to make my way down Gay Street on Friday night to support my district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6548)|
| 1:49:13| But especially the art shows I think will be a really fun opportunity for people to see the display of art.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6553)|
| 1:49:19| And as we talked about art in our strategic plan, I mean, we've got some amazing artists in our community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6559)|
| 1:49:26| That's Christine now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6566)|
| 1:49:27| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6567)|
| 1:49:28| Any more comments, questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6568)|
| 1:49:31| Without objection, we are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/SchoolBoard264190405?start=6571)|
