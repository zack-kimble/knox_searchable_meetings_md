| 0:07:54| There's two of our team members that are not here today, Kelsey Browns in softball, a freshman, and also Carly, one of our juniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=474)|
| 0:08:03| But I have nine of our 11 members here from our team this year, three seniors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=483)|
| 0:08:08| And I can tell you that this group has everything what it means to be a team as far as chemistry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=488)|
| 0:08:14| and the work ethic, the attitude.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=494)|

| 0:08:59| Mayor Haslam, I'm going to suggest that you get behind the city ceiling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=539)|
| 0:09:03| It makes it really special.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=543)|

| 0:11:46| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=706)|
| 0:11:47| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=707)|
| 0:11:48| I had a conversation with Mr. Wetzel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=708)|
| 0:11:50| I just wanted to make sure that I understand it all correctly when it comes to this, that this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=710)|
| 0:11:57| from the drawing that we've got in here, it wasn't real clear as to, will there still be a right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=717)|
| 0:12:04| or something for access to the other buildings there on Jackson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=724)|
| 0:12:08| There will be, Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=728)|
| 0:12:10| I've got a little map right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=730)|
| 0:12:12| I don't know if you can see it from that far away, but the little blue spot, probably from where you're sitting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=732)|
| 0:12:17| would be the lease property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=737)|
| 0:12:19| And the orange line is what you'll hear later on discussed tonight as the option track.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=739)|
| 0:12:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=744)|
| 0:12:25| So you'll see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=745)|
| 0:12:26| So from the option track, you can move to the lease property, proposed lease property, which is right here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=746)|
| 0:12:30| And what is the access there off of World's Fair Park Drive between King or Lighting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=750)|
| 0:12:37| Is that an alley or what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=757)|
| 0:12:39| Is the city on that property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=759)|
| 0:12:41| It appears to be an alley at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=761)|
| 0:12:43| We've done, Steve's department's done a lot of deed research and looked at the old maps| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=763)|
| 0:12:47| and determined that there is an alley there that's marked in the green.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=767)|
| 0:12:50| Here is a green spot on this map as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=770)|
| 0:12:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=773)|
| 0:12:54| So we're not leasing any of that to anybody?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=774)|
| 0:12:56| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=776)|
| 0:12:58| No, that's open to the public right away to help develop the entire block through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=778)|
| 0:13:01| That's what we're trying to use it for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=781)|
| 0:13:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=782)|
| 0:13:03| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=783)|
| 0:13:04| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=784)|
| 0:13:05| I've talked to Mr. Wetzel earlier today and talked to Mr. Petrie a little while ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=785)|
| 0:13:08| And this kind of gets more towards additionally towards the later item concerning the property right of way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=788)|
| 0:13:18| The question that's kind of a sticking point for me is that the city is acquiring property for public| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=798)|
| 0:13:29| or for private businesses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=809)|
| 0:13:32| I have a little issue with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=812)|
| 0:13:34| I mean, I want the project to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=814)|
| 0:13:36| I'm fine with the lease of the property, which apparently there had been a 50-year lease previous| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=816)|
| 0:13:44| and previously in place, which is since acquired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=824)|
| 0:13:48| But, you know, looking at this information and then also the city is going to have to demolish some sort of building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=828)|
| 0:13:56| and there's going to be a cost associated with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=836)|
| 0:14:00| And then, you know, it gets into without the city's acquisition of public access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=840)|
| 0:14:04| the property has no value for the intended use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=844)|
| 0:14:12| You know, folks need to be treated fairly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=852)|
| 0:14:16| And, you know, I hate to bring things up, but you have people that I certainly disagree with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=856)|
| 0:14:22| but you have people advancing positions that they have not been treated fairly with the city for years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=862)|
| 0:14:29| And I just think folks should be treated fairly, so I have some concerns about this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=869)|
| 0:14:36| Can I just address a couple of things here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=876)|
| 0:14:38| The RFP out where you quoted from, we weren't sure about a couple of the things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=878)|
| 0:14:41| Most of those things have been taken care of now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=881)|
| 0:14:44| The building that was there has been demolished.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=884)|
| 0:14:46| That was the cost of $7,000 to the city for a structure that's part of the Jackson Avenue redevelopment area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=886)|
| 0:14:54| And we also were not sure at that time about the alley that has since been cleared up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=894)|
| 0:14:59| So those things have now been dealt with, which we didn't have that information a month ago when we started forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=899)|
| 0:15:04| But we certainly believe in treating people fairly as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=904)|
| 0:15:07| But I guess my point is the city is acquiring private property using taxpayer funds to give to private property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=907)|
| 0:15:17| who aren't even reimbursing the city at the very least.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=917)|
| 0:15:20| There will be no giveaway to anybody, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=920)|
| 0:15:22| What we're acquiring is a public right-of-way along the rear of these buildings so that all of it can be developed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=922)|
| 0:15:29| But who's paying for it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=929)|
| 0:15:32| It will be a public purchase of a public right-of-way in Fee Simple that will be able to be used by every property owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=932)|
| 0:15:38| on Jackson from Broadway on down towards Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=938)|
| 0:15:43| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=943)|
| 0:15:44| But it's being acquired so private property owners will be benefiting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=944)|
| 0:15:50| Private property owners will benefit as they often do in economic redevelopment districts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=950)|
| 0:15:54| when the city makes a commitment to do economic development in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=954)|
| 0:15:58| But I guess my point is it says in here that the properties are unusable for their intended use if the property is not acquired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=958)|
| 0:16:08| Are you quoting from the RFP of the lease?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=968)|
| 0:16:14| Once again, that's what we were not sure what we had at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=974)|
| 0:16:17| I'm quoting from the January, it's dated January 26, 2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=977)|
| 0:16:23| The property has no value for the intended use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=983)|
| 0:16:29| And that's just part of the game plan here was to try to move forward with this acquisition for this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=989)|
| 0:16:36| and other properties along the corridor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=996)|
| 0:16:38| And the timing is just coincidental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=998)|
| 0:16:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1001)|
| 0:16:42| Councilman Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1002)|
| 0:16:44| Councilman Bailey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1004)|
| 0:16:45| Mayor, I just wanted to ask Councilman Frost, who are you referring to as being treated unfairly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1005)|
| 0:16:51| Well, they're allegations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1011)|
| 0:16:52| I've seen litigation against KCDC in particular.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1012)|

| 0:17:21| The other things I just take issue with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1041)|
| 0:17:23| Well, I'm always, as you know, I'm always looking, trying to see where we're treating someone unfairly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1043)|
| 0:17:29| or trying to take advantage of someone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1049)|
| 0:17:32| And, you know, we've done a number of these things around the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1052)|
| 0:17:35| And so I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1055)|
| 0:17:36| I was just curious what you were referring to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1056)|
| 0:17:40| Dr. Lyons.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1060)|
| 0:17:41| I'd like to add.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1061)|
| 0:17:42| I think I know the context of this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1062)|
| 0:17:44| Councilman Frost, we pursued this option when some other properties and some other issues were up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1064)|
| 0:17:52| especially to protect the interest of all property owners on Jackson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1072)|
| 0:17:56| when another party had this option that would have precluded access to the buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1076)|
| 0:18:01| That's why the city went ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1081)|
| 0:18:02| We're talking about the other item, but they're connected, I know, in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1082)|
| 0:18:05| That's why we went, why we sought the option was to protect the interest of all the property owners on Jackson| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1085)|
| 0:18:11| who would have not otherwise had access to the building because the railroad had purchased the, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1091)|
| 0:18:18| the railroad had conveyed to another party a track that went in back of all the buildings on Jackson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1098)|
| 0:18:24| And without our action to get this option, the property owners on Jackson would not have had access to their buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1104)|
| 0:18:31| We pursued this specifically in pursuit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1111)|
| 0:18:37| Well, we pursued this specifically to protect all the property owners on Jackson way before Mr. Petrie's project ever came along.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1117)|

| 0:24:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1477)|
| 0:24:39| Did we vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1479)|
| 0:24:40| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1480)|
| 0:24:41| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1481)|
| 0:24:42| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1482)|
| 0:24:43| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1483)|
| 0:24:44| 11N is a resolution authorizing the mayor to execute the second amendment to option| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1484)|

| 0:25:00| non-exclusive easement from the option tract to Jackson Avenue from Jackson Avenue Parking, LLC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1500)|
| 0:25:06| Move to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1506)|
| 0:25:07| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1507)|
| 0:25:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1508)|
| 0:25:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1509)|
| 0:25:10| Councilman Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1510)|
| 0:25:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1511)|
| 0:25:12| I pointed this out to Mr. Mills before the meeting, but we're going to have to, he's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1512)|
| 0:25:16| of the opinion we're going to need to amend this because the entity we're dealing with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1516)|
| 0:25:22| has been revoked.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1522)|
| 0:25:24| Their authority to do business in the state of Tennessee has been revoked administratively| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1524)|
| 0:25:29| by the Tennessee Secretary of State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1529)|
| 0:25:34| So I'd like to make a motion to approve this pending their charter being reinstated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1534)|
| 0:25:41| by the Tennessee Secretary of State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1541)|
| 0:25:43| If Mr. Mills wants to comment too, that'd be fine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1543)|
| 0:25:46| It's an administrative revocation, a fairly easy fix, but it is some paperwork that would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1546)|
| 0:25:51| need to be filed with the Secretary of State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1551)|
| 0:25:53| So is it your recommendation that we not deal with this at this point or what's your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1553)|
| 0:25:57| recommendation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1557)|
| 0:25:59| It's either approved pending the reinstatement by the Secretary of State or it can be approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1559)|
| 0:26:05| and we would hold that in the law department until we have an actual living entity to be| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1565)|
| 0:26:09| able to contract with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1569)|
| 0:26:10| Yeah, that's what I was saying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1570)|
| 0:26:12| His suggestion before the meeting was to amend it pending being reinstated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1572)|
| 0:26:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1578)|
| 0:26:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1579)|
| 0:26:20| That was my motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1580)|
| 0:26:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1581)|
| 0:26:22| Councilman Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1582)|
| 0:26:23| Well, I had another item on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1583)|
| 0:26:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1585)|
| 0:26:26| We had some discussion on this earlier when the other item came up on the lease and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1586)|
| 0:26:32| building on the corner, but I was wondering, and I'm in favor of the acquisition, I just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1592)|
| 0:26:40| was curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1600)|
| 0:26:41| Originally, my understanding when we negotiated the option in the beginning, we were looking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1601)|
| 0:26:48| at not, we weren't talking about just access to the buildings, but we were talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1608)|
| 0:26:54| a potential greenway alignment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| Anybody want to say anything about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1616)|
| 0:27:00| I realize that you had to acquire all the pieces to have a greenway and that we're not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1620)|
| 0:27:03| there even if we acquire this, but.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1623)|
| 0:27:05| I can't count the number of meetings I've sat through talking about what the greenway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1625)|
| 0:27:08| where the greenway ought to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1628)|
| 0:27:09| They said that at the current time, the plan is the greenway would go along the street| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1629)|
| 0:27:13| and that might be used to help do street improvements along Jackson because it's so tight and we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1633)|
| 0:27:18| need the service area down below these buildings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1638)|
| 0:27:22| So this is just going to be service access only?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1642)|
| 0:27:24| That's the intent at this point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1644)|
| 0:27:26| That could change because this will be city property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1646)|
| 0:27:28| It will be city property at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1648)|
| 0:27:30| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1650)|
| 0:27:31| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1651)|
| 0:27:34| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1654)|
| 0:27:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1655)|
| 0:27:36| Second thing, when I was looking at this this afternoon, this started jogging memories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1656)|
| 0:27:41| This is something that we've dealt with this particular person before and I started getting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1661)|
| 0:27:48| online and finding different articles and thanks to Mrs. Mitchell, we entered into a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1668)|
| 0:27:56| contract in October of 2004 with this group where we're leasing parking from them at a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1676)|
| 0:28:05| rate of $55 a month, 200 spaces, and they were supposed to have commenced construction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1685)|
| 0:28:14| on 109 condominiums, which have not been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1694)|
| 0:28:19| And Mrs. Mitchell was kind enough to locate for me a resolution from October of 2004,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1699)|
| 0:28:26| and under defaults and remedies, when we're discussing with these people, assuming this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1706)|
| 0:28:32| gets passed, that they're in default of this agreement from October of 2004.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1712)|
| 0:28:40| It says, the following shall be an event for default, the failure of the lessor to substantially| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1720)|
| 0:28:45| commence construction of the lessor's residential facility, phase one, within six months of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1725)|
| 0:28:52| the completion of the parking area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1732)|
| 0:28:54| I would respectfully submit that we either need to renegotiate a lease that's more favorable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1734)|
| 0:29:00| for the taxpayers, if not end it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1740)|
| 0:29:04| Period.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1744)|
| 0:29:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1745)|
| 0:29:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1746)|
| 0:29:07| Councilwoman Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1747)|
| 0:29:08| I'd like to recognize Mr. Petrie if he would like to address us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1748)|
| 0:29:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1750)|
| 0:29:11| I sure would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1751)|
| 0:29:12| If you could give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1752)|
| 0:29:13| Joe Petrie, 900 South Gay Street, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| Thank you, Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1756)|
| 0:29:17| I was hoping you might ask me if I stood here long enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1757)|
| 0:29:22| I am an interested party to this particular action resolution, and so I just wanted to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1762)|
| 0:29:28| speak just for a moment to kind of clear up something Mr. Frost said earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1768)|
| 0:29:32| Mr. Frost, a couple of points that you made.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1772)|
| 0:29:36| One, these are two very distinctly different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1776)|
| 0:29:40| We want an RFP, Southeastern Glass Building LLC, that enabled us to lease the tract under| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1780)|
| 0:29:47| the bridge, taking the city's liability on to ourselves and securing that as parking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1787)|
| 0:29:55| Without this public right-of-way, two things happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1795)|
| 0:29:58| One, we discovered somewhere in the process that the codes enforcement office and building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1798)|
| 0:30:05| permitting will not give the owners of property along Jackson Avenue permits without egress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1805)|
| 0:30:11| onto a public right-of-way to the rear of their properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1811)|
| 0:30:14| Apparently, this tract has just been an anomaly for some time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1814)|
| 0:30:19| It's one of those things that without development sparked in that district, nobody knew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1819)|
| 0:30:25| So, it's upon discovery of that that the necessity for a public right-of-way was created, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1825)|
| 0:30:32| would benefit also the McClung warehouses and the property that you're talking about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1832)|
| 0:30:37| right now, which is leased by the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1837)|
| 0:30:40| So, it would tie together, and Keener Lighting as well, on the other side of the Broadway viaduct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1840)|
| 0:30:46| What you've in fact done already is ensure a lease that we are bound to through an RFP| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1846)|
| 0:30:54| and through the lease that you just approved to a tract of land for which we have no access now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1854)|
| 0:31:01| And so, that's not just for our benefit, but it is for the redevelopment of the whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1861)|
| 0:31:06| Jackson Avenue district that is in the Jackson Depot Redevelopment District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1866)|
| 0:31:12| So, it benefits every property along there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1872)|
| 0:31:15| This is proposed as a public right-of-way, a city alley, just like every other alley| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1875)|
| 0:31:22| in the downtown grid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1882)|
| 0:31:23| This one, just because it was against the railroad tracks, apparently has never had an alley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1883)|
| 0:31:30| My issue is not with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1890)|
| 0:31:32| It's just that with this cityscape development, when we're dealing with these people, there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1892)|
| 0:31:39| are different levels involved that you're not involved with whatsoever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1899)|
| 0:31:43| So, this isn't getting to the southeast glass building at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1903)|
| 0:31:48| It's just, you know, we were dealing with an entity that as part of their agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1908)|
| 0:31:54| with the city, they were going to build 109 condominium units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1914)|
| 0:31:58| And as part of the deal, which they said publicly, was that the payments that the city was going| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1918)|
| 0:32:04| to make in leasing the property was going to pay for their construction debt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| That involved cityscapes and the entity the city is willing to execute the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| execute the option on the property with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1934)|
| 0:32:16| It doesn't involve you and your group.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1936)|
| 0:32:20| No, we just, I just mentioned that because when you said in fairness, this actually would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1940)|
| 0:32:26| be the fair thing to do for all property owners on that block.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1946)|
| 0:32:29| So, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1949)|
| 0:32:31| Ms. Roddy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| To follow up on Mr. Petrie's comments, my understanding from Mr. Wetzel today, and maybe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1952)|
| 0:32:36| Mr. Byrd can comment on this, but in case of a fire in these buildings, I guess folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1956)|
| 0:32:40| need to be able to have egress to a public right-of-way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1960)|
| 0:32:43| And this provides that public right-of-way behind the building as well as what they have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1963)|
| 0:32:47| say, in the Jackson Avenue block in the front as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1967)|
| 0:32:50| So, it would facilitate development because you would have that access, that safe access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1970)|
| 0:32:56| on both sides.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1976)|
| 0:32:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| Other comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1980)|
| 0:33:02| Okay, ready to vote then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1982)|
| 0:33:04| Well, yeah, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1984)|
| 0:33:06| We're voting on the amendment first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1986)|
| 0:33:08| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1988)|
| 0:33:10| Okay, all those in favor of amending, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| Motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1994)|
| 0:33:16| Now back to the motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1996)|
| 0:33:18| Any further discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=1998)|
| 0:33:20| Okay, all those in favor, aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2000)|
| 0:33:22| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2002)|
| 0:33:24| Okay, motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2004)|
| 0:33:26| 12A is an ordinance to amend the 2008-2009 operating budget of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2006)|

| 0:33:41| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2021)|
| 0:33:43| There's a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2023)|
| 0:33:45| Okay, Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2025)|
| 0:33:47| Briefly, for this item and the next item, when we were in our budget hearings, excuse me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2027)|
| 0:33:53| budget retreat at the Square Room last month and we heard things aren't too rosy right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2033)|
| 0:33:59| I mean, granted, the funds that are involved in 12A and 12B certainly are not a solution to the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2039)|
| 0:34:08| It's a partial solution at best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2048)|
| 0:34:14| I think it is important that folks consider helping out however in which way we can help out in economic times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2054)|
| 0:34:27| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2067)|
| 0:34:29| I'll come back over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2069)|
| 0:34:31| Go ahead.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2071)|
| 0:34:33| I'm going to make a motion to postpone both of these items, 12A and 12B, for two weeks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2073)|
| 0:34:37| because Councilmember Becker, excuse me, Vice Mayor Becker is not here| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| and I think he should participate in this discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2081)|
| 0:34:43| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2083)|
| 0:34:45| There's a motion to postpone which takes precedent in a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| Now, any discussion on the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2087)|
| 0:34:49| Would you like to discuss the postponement or is that the light for back to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2089)|
| 0:34:53| Actually, my light was for the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2093)|
| 0:34:57| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2097)|
| 0:34:59| Joe, do you want to discuss the postponement or the original?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2099)|
| 0:35:01| Original.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2101)|
| 0:35:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2103)|
| 0:35:05| Anybody want to comment on the motion to postpone for two weeks?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2105)|
| 0:35:07| 12A and B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2107)|
| 0:35:10| 12A and B was what the motion was by Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2110)|
| 0:35:12| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2112)|
| 0:35:14| I mean, that's fine if that's what, you know, folks want to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2114)|
| 0:35:16| We've passed a lot of things tonight without Mr. Becker here, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2116)|
| 0:35:20| and I anticipate we'll pass other things after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2124)|
| 0:35:26| Well, I would say that these affect Mr. Becker directly, potentially,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2126)|
| 0:35:30| and these are really Council-related items in terms of how we function as Council to some degree,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2130)|
| 0:35:36| more than some of the other things we've approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2136)|
| 0:35:39| And so both as a Council member and as Vice Mayor, I think he should be involved in the discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2139)|
| 0:35:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2145)|
| 0:35:47| Any other comments on the postponement?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2147)|
| 0:35:49| I'll comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2149)|
| 0:35:51| Ms. Beadle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2151)|
| 0:35:53| I don't disagree at all with you in your thinking about Councilman Becker or Vice Mayor Becker| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2153)|
| 0:35:57| wishing to be a participant in that discussion because it does involve him directly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2157)|
| 0:36:04| And we have historically, if one of us is missing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2164)|
| 0:36:10| as was the 6th District Representative, we waited until that seat was filled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2170)|
| 0:36:14| and that discussion could occur and those votes could occur.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2174)|
| 0:36:19| That would directly affect that district.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2179)|
| 0:36:22| I did have comments I wanted to make in regard to the original motion, but I didn't wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2182)|
| 0:36:28| We're voting on, then, the motion to postpone for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2188)|
| 0:36:32| All in favor, aye. Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2192)|

| 0:36:39| It's a theme tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| That's right. So the motion that that is postponed for both 12A and 12B are postponed for two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2200)|

| 0:41:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2505)|
| 0:41:46| We do have one person signed up for public forum.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2506)|
| 0:41:47| Kristina Shands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2507)|
| 0:41:49| If I mispronounced that, I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2509)|
| 0:41:51| Come on down and if you'll come to the podium and give us your name and address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2511)|
| 0:41:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2518)|
| 0:41:59| My name is Kristina Shands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2519)|
| 0:42:01| My address is 123A Southgate Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2521)|
| 0:42:03| You were close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2523)|
| 0:42:05| I'm the Director of Development and Communications with the Tennessee Clean Water Network.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2525)|
| 0:42:09| We are a statewide nonprofit organization based here in Knoxville, and we work on water quality issues across the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2529)|
| 0:42:17| Right now in Nashville, there are several bad bills that could have a significant impact on water quality in Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2537)|
| 0:42:23| These bills don't do anything to clarify existing laws or processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2543)|
| 0:42:27| They change the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2547)|
| 0:42:29| These bills blatantly strip protection away from our waters, grant permission to pollute our waters without justification, and give up on cleaning waters that are already polluted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2549)|
| 0:42:39| One of these bills is Senate Bill 0631, House Bill 1616.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| It prevents polluted waters from being classified as exceptional Tennessee waters and removes the burden of proving an economic and social need for projects which impact exceptional waters when the project is publicly funded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2564)|
| 0:43:00| In Knox County, there are approximately 340 miles of impaired waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2580)|
| 0:43:03| This bill would remove the current level of protection from these impaired waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2583)|
| 0:43:07| Now these are the waters that need protection the most, and it includes the Holston River, which is home to federally endangered Pink Mucket and the federally threatened Snell Darter, the French Broad River, which is a state scenic river in its entirety and also home to the federally endangered Pink Mucket and the federally threatened Snell Darter, plus the state endangered Lake Sturgeon and State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2587)|
| 0:43:33| The state endangered Blue Sucker, Turkey Creek, which is home to the endangered Sweet Scent Ladies Truss, and Hogskin Branch, which is a state natural area located here in Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2613)|
| 0:43:46| Along with the bill I just mentioned, we have two additional bills that are very dangerous to water quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2626)|
| 0:43:52| It's Senate Bill 0632, House Bill 1615, and Senate Bill 0633, House Bill 1617.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2632)|
| 0:43:55| These bills redefine wet weather conveyances and create a new class of waters called limited resource waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2635)|
| 0:44:05| These bills strip protection from smaller streams and neighborhood creeks, allowing the destruction of these vital water sources.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2645)|
| 0:44:12| More than 30,000 miles of streams are in danger of losing protection from pollution, and that's almost half the streams in our state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2652)|
| 0:44:20| Fewer streams equal less water for all of us to enjoy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2660)|
| 0:44:24| In a time when the rest of the nation is moving forward in water policy and regulation, Tennessee legislators want to remove protection from our waters and neglect the responsibility to clean waters that have been neglected and polluted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2664)|
| 0:44:39| On behalf of Tennessee Clean Water Network, Board of Directors, and members, I respectfully ask Knoxville City Council to support not weakening current water policy in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2679)|
| 0:44:50| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2690)|
| 0:44:52| Thank you very much for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2692)|
| 0:44:54| Mr. Hall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2694)|
| 0:44:56| Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2696)|
| 0:44:58| I don't want to sound stupid, but what is a pink mucket?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2698)|
| 0:45:02| Several of us here didn't really know what that was.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2702)|
| 0:45:04| I'm not sure what it is, but it's endangered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2704)|
| 0:45:06| Whatever it is, it's very important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2706)|
| 0:45:08| It is endangered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2708)|
| 0:45:10| It's important.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2710)|
| 0:45:12| Don't fish, don't hunt, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2712)|
| 0:45:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2714)|
| 0:45:16| Mr. Holquist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2716)|
| 0:45:18| Would you like a specific action from this council, such as a resolution opposing the passage of these bills?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2718)|
| 0:45:22| That would be fantastic, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2722)|
| 0:45:24| Well, if you could, I would be glad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2724)|
| 0:45:26| I mean, I don't know about other council members.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2726)|
| 0:45:28| I'd certainly be glad to introduce such a resolution based on the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2728)|
| 0:45:30| I'd maybe need some more information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2730)|
| 0:45:32| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2732)|
| 0:45:34| But based on what I'm hearing, it sounds reasonable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2736)|
| 0:45:38| That would be two weeks, though, at the next council meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2738)|
| 0:45:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| And we'd have to get that on the agenda fairly soon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2742)|
| 0:45:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| I'd be happy to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2746)|
| 0:45:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2748)|
| 0:45:50| Mr. Frost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2750)|
| 0:45:52| Basically, you all aren't wanting these clean water bills watered down?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| Very clever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2756)|
| 0:45:58| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2758)|
| 0:46:00| Mr. Booker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2760)|
| 0:46:02| I wonder if you've talked to the Knox County legislative delegation about your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| We are working with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2764)|
| 0:46:06| Right now, these bills are in subcommittee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2766)|
| 0:46:08| We're in the environmental committee, so we are working with our legislators to get them to try to kill them in committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2768)|
| 0:46:14| so they don't make it to the full House or Senate for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2774)|
| 0:46:18| We're not having a lot of luck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2778)|
| 0:46:20| We actually have 14 bad bills, bad water bills this session.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2780)|
| 0:46:24| So the environmental committee, both in House and Senate, are not very supportive of more water protection or improving our water quality.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2784)|
| 0:46:36| So we're kind of having a difficult time with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2796)|
| 0:46:38| But we are working with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2798)|
| 0:46:40| Every week, we go down to Nashville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2800)|
| 0:46:42| Have you talked with the Knox County legislative delegation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2802)|
| 0:46:46| I'm sure our policy director has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| I know she's talked with several of the legislative members that are on the committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2808)|
| 0:46:54| Well, they're the guys who have the clout.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2814)|
| 0:46:56| We can pass a resolution, but they're the ones who vote for or against the bill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2816)|
| 0:47:00| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2820)|
| 0:47:02| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2822)|
| 0:47:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2824)|
| 0:47:06| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2826)|
| 0:47:08| Thank you for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2828)|
| 0:47:10| We stand adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| Thank you, everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/citycouncil090310?start=2832)|
