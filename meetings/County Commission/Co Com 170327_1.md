| 3:07:38| The report of MPC, Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11258)|
| 3:07:42| This matter was heard and approved on consent. The street name change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11262)|
| 3:07:47| The applicant needs to get an address in order to be able to get a building permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11267)|
| 3:07:52| This is in the 8th District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11272)|
| 3:07:54| When the sign went up to change the name of the road, people said you can't change the name of East Emery Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11274)|
| 3:08:01| And I said no, it's the unnamed access between two lots going to a lot off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11281)|
| 3:08:09| This creates this young lady an address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11289)|
| 3:08:15| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11295)|
| 3:08:16| I just want to say I want to come and live on this street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11296)|
| 3:08:18| Me too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11298)|
| 3:08:19| I mean, my gosh, it just makes you want to live there, so I love it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11299)|
| 3:08:22| Well, it's fairly close to Claps Chapel United Methodist Church, but it's in a curve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11302)|
| 3:08:28| so I don't know whether you'd want to be pulling out on Emery Road there or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11308)|
| 3:08:34| If there be no further discussion, the motion needs to be made, and I'm going to make it to approve per MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11314)|
| 3:08:46| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11326)|

| 3:08:54| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11334)|

| 3:08:59| Yours is okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11339)|
| 3:09:00| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11340)|
| 3:09:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11341)|
| 3:09:02| 2-B-17-RC is a request of Paul G. Hibben for rezoning from A agricultural to PR plan residential| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11342)|
| 3:09:10| at a density up to four dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11350)|
| 3:09:14| Property located northwest side of Twin Oak Lane, southwest of Tazewell Park in the 8th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11354)|
| 3:09:19| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11359)|
| 3:09:25| Your name and address for the record, please, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11365)|
| 3:09:27| Garrett Tucker with Robert Campbell and Associates, 7523 Taggart Lane, Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11367)|
| 3:09:35| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11375)|
| 3:09:39| Is there any opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11379)|
| 3:09:41| Mr. Kelly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11381)|
| 3:09:43| Report of MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11383)|
| 3:09:45| By a vote of 14-0, MPC recommends approval of the PR zoning at four dwelling units per acre as requested by the applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11385)|
| 3:09:57| This also is an 8th District, and I guess it's an illustration of what happens whenever you build a middle school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11397)|
| 3:10:04| because this is almost immediately adjacent to the area where the new middle school is well, well up out of the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11404)|
| 3:10:13| I make a motion that it be approved for MPC recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11413)|
| 3:10:17| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11417)|
| 3:10:19| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is properly before us. All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11419)|
| 3:10:24| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11424)|
| 3:10:25| Opposed, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11425)|
| 3:10:27| The motion carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11427)|
| 3:10:29| Good luck, Mr. Tucker and also Mr. Hibben.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11429)|
| 3:10:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11433)|
| 3:10:34| 1-I-17-RC is a request of Joyce Webb for a resign from T.E. Transition and F. Floodway to O.B. Office of Medical and Related Services and F. Floodway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11434)|
| 3:10:44| property located northwest side of Ebenezer Road northeast of South Peters Road in the 5th Commission District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11444)|
| 3:10:50| Is the applicant present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11450)|
| 3:10:53| Good evening. I'm Jared Garceau, appearing on behalf of the applicant, 620 Market Street, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37902.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11453)|
| 3:11:03| A report of MPC, Mr. Kelly?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11463)|
| 3:11:06| By a vote of 14-0, MPC recommends approval of the O.B. zoning for this 2.23-acre site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11466)|
| 3:11:15| Is there any opposition? Is there any opposition? A couple of people raising hands.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11475)|
| 3:11:24| Mr. Garza, would you like to make an opening statement to be then responded to by opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11484)|
| 3:11:29| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11489)|
| 3:11:33| So this is a rezoning request, 725 Ebenezer Road from transition to O.B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11493)|
| 3:11:41| As Mr. Kelly stated, the MPC staff recommended approval and the MPC voted unanimously on February 9th to recommend to the commission approval of the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11501)|
| 3:11:55| The property is located in the southwest sector of Knox County and the southwest sector plan proposes MDR office uses for this site, which is consistent with the O.B. zoning that's been requested.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11515)|
| 3:12:13| The adjacent property to the south has been zoned O.B. since 1992 and there's currently a three or four-story self-storage facility that's operating at that property to the south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11533)|
| 3:12:31| I think it's important to note that this is just a rezoning request at this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11551)|
| 3:12:35| I think that there is going to be some opposition to the use involved, which is a sober living home for women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11555)|
| 3:12:46| But we're going to deal with the use, assuming that the rezoning request is approved, we'll be dealing with the use issue with the MPC on a request for a similar use determination in the O.B. zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11566)|
| 3:13:01| And so, you know, the standards for the rezoning request differ than the standards for the use and today we're focused on the rezoning request standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11581)|
| 3:13:14| Who would speak for the opposition?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11594)|
| 3:13:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11597)|
| 3:13:22| Your name and address, Ms. Klein, for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11602)|
| 3:13:24| Margo Klein, 8845 Ebenezer Oaks Lane. I'm here on behalf of the Council of West Knox County Homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11604)|
| 3:13:32| We also have another person to speak, so I'm going to be as brief as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11612)|
| 3:13:37| We are actually not here to voice any opposition to the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11617)|
| 3:13:43| We are very well aware that Knox County, as well as the rest of the country, has a tremendous problem with opiate addiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11623)|
| 3:13:52| And Randy Nichols, former district attorney, came and spoke to the Council of West Knox County Homeowners about a year ago and expressed that about 75 percent of babies born at UT Hospital have opiates in their system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11632)|
| 3:14:10| So, you know, I would personally advocate for this type of housing and the Council of West Knox County Homeowners does as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11650)|
| 3:14:18| We would love to see many more of these sorts of facilities if they are properly regulated, if there is reasonable guidance within our ordinances to define whether they really are group homes, halfway houses, transitional homes, recovery facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11658)|
| 3:14:40| Right now, the ordinances don't really give those definitions, much less give guidelines for which zones they can operate in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11680)|
| 3:14:51| We view the rezoning to be essentially a spot rezoning to allow a use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11691)|
| 3:14:57| We do not want the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11697)|
| 3:15:01| I would prefer for this particular facility to continue operating in transitional zoning, which was established to provide a buffer between more intensive uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11701)|
| 3:15:12| Despite the fact that there may be an office zoning to the south, it is, excuse me, but I'm not aware of anything immediately adjacent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11712)|
| 3:15:22| There is a storage facility that is not medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11722)|
| 3:15:24| There are some medical offices, but they're about a mile away.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11724)|
| 3:15:29| The majority of the use on all three sides to this property are residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11729)|
| 3:15:36| There's also a public park immediately adjacent, Dunn Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11736)|
| 3:15:41| We just feel that there should either be denial or a postponement for the county commission to consider definitions and zoning where different types of facilities like this are appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11741)|
| 3:15:56| Thanks, and I'll give my time to Marie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11756)|
| 3:16:06| Your name and address for the record, please, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11766)|
| 3:16:09| My name is Marie McGuigan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11769)|
| 3:16:11| My address is 1313 Farrington Drive, Knoxville, Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11771)|
| 3:16:17| I'm coming just to second what Margo Klein just said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11777)|
| 3:16:25| My concern when I read that this facility was being used as a rooming house or a halfway house for recovering women,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11785)|
| 3:16:36| I have 22 years in the alcohol and drug abuse field,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11796)|
| 3:16:42| and the last 12 years was specifically working for an agency which operates for the past 50 years group homes and halfway houses up in New York State.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11802)|
| 3:16:55| Now, I know probably Tennessee doesn't want all the regulations that a state like New York has for its companies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11815)|
| 3:17:05| However, I am well familiar that to just grant a rezoning without any looking at the use of this home and what the guidelines are for establishing a home for people who need lots of planning, treatment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11825)|
| 3:17:25| at times medication, all of those things, aftercare,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11845)|
| 3:17:30| it's a very regulated business because a home for recovering people is usually a home for people who have not made good decisions for themselves in prior years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11850)|
| 3:17:45| And so they need a lot of good staffing, educated staffing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11865)|
| 3:17:51| staffing that is both recovering and non-recovering persons usually to help them set up guidelines.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11871)|
| 3:17:59| So my concern is that you rezone this without any look at use or restriction for how it's used and putting up to 30 people in a site that really has,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11879)|
| 3:18:13| I'm going to say this and I don't mean it negatively, lots of places to hide in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11893)|
| 3:18:21| Anytime you get 30 recovering people in a room together, you need staff there to help them and 24-hour staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11901)|
| 3:18:30| So my concern is really what are the regulations or what are the restrictions that might be involved in just giving an open designation to a medical building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11910)|
| 3:18:43| I don't know if I made that clear or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11923)|
| 3:18:47| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11927)|
| 3:18:49| Thank you, Ms. McQuegan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11929)|
| 3:18:51| Counselor Garza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11931)|
| 3:18:56| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11936)|
| 3:18:58| First I would say I think that what I heard from the opposition respectfully confirms that the concern is with the use as opposed to the rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11938)|
| 3:19:10| And at this point we just have a rezoning request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11950)|
| 3:19:16| The use will be dealt with under a similar use determination with the MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11956)|
| 3:19:21| We have the four standards that the zoning ordinance provides for whether a rezoning request should be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11961)|
| 3:19:30| They're discussed in detail within the staff recommendation and staff found and the MPC agreed that all four requirements are specifically met in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11970)|
| 3:19:42| which means that the rezoning request should be granted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11982)|
| 3:19:46| Now once we do start getting into the specifics with the use, we have two full-time staff members that are three full-time staff members that are at the facility 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=11986)|
| 3:20:05| And then we have six additional that help that are not necessarily 24-7.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12005)|
| 3:20:12| So this facility is very, very well run.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12012)|
| 3:20:19| They provide transportation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12019)|
| 3:20:22| They help the women in the facility get employment and they provide transportation to and from the jobs in order to prevent the women from going off and maybe doing stuff that they shouldn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12022)|
| 3:20:36| They have tight security measures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12036)|
| 3:20:38| They have, I think, at least eight cameras around the facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12038)|
| 3:20:44| They have alarm systems set up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12044)|
| 3:20:46| There's a strict curfew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12046)|
| 3:20:48| There are lots of, this isn't just a group of women in a home that have no procedures or policies that they're following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12048)|
| 3:20:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12058)|
| 3:20:59| Let me drag us back to this is rezoning that we're talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12059)|
| 3:21:05| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12065)|
| 3:21:06| So what is before us is something that MPC has unanimously said you've met all the conditions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12066)|
| 3:21:16| Does the opposition have anything else they'd wish to add?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12076)|
| 3:21:20| Ms. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12080)|
| 3:21:22| Ms. Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12082)|
| 3:21:28| Again, I would just like to say that this is spot rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12088)|
| 3:21:32| The office that is in the area is not office medical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12092)|
| 3:21:37| Office medical allows pain clinics and methadone clinics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12097)|
| 3:21:42| We feel that those particular uses, which are not related to this one, are not appropriate for this site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12102)|
| 3:21:50| If this business should move, the rezoning would remain office medical,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12110)|
| 3:21:57| which means the door would be open to a number of other uses that may not be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12117)|
| 3:22:03| Also, I'd like to point out that I got some incorrect information from a member of MPC that this matter was going to be tabled,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12123)|
| 3:22:15| and it was just a simple misunderstanding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12135)|
| 3:22:17| I did not come to the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12137)|
| 3:22:21| Had I come, I don't know that it would have been unanimous.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12141)|
| 3:22:24| I'm not saying I carry that much weight, but nobody was there to speak against it at MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12144)|
| 3:22:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12149)|
| 3:22:31| I believe Commissioner Anders, we will now be in the questions of commissioners of the present presenters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12151)|
| 3:22:41| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12161)|
| 3:22:43| Counselor, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12163)|
| 3:22:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12165)|
| 3:22:48| So has this business been operating?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12168)|
| 3:22:51| I guess I understand the business is already operating there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12171)|
| 3:22:54| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12174)|
| 3:22:55| And how many people live there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12175)|
| 3:22:57| I think it's approximately 35, 28 currently.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12177)|
| 3:23:03| And what brought them to MPC?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12183)|
| 3:23:05| I'm assuming codes went out and said you can't do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12185)|
| 3:23:07| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12187)|
| 3:23:08| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12188)|
| 3:23:10| Do they, I guess the proper question would be, did they meet safety and fire standards for 35 people living under that facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12190)|
| 3:23:22| Well, that's something that we're going to be working with the county officials, Mr. Roy Braden and the fire marshal, et cetera,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12202)|
| 3:23:31| to make sure that all of that is set up, assuming that we get the property rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12211)|
| 3:23:36| Is the building sprinkled currently?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12216)|
| 3:23:39| It's not currently sprinkled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12219)|
| 3:23:44| So we moved 35 people into a facility with no sprinklers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12224)|
| 3:23:50| and we're wanting us to rezone it and give you permission to have them live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12230)|
| 3:23:56| Well, the rezoning does not necessarily grant a blanket allowance for them to live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12236)|
| 3:24:04| We still have to deal with the use, and that's where we hope to work with MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12244)|
| 3:24:10| to figure out exactly what type of safety precautions have to be in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12250)|
| 3:24:18| Your first indication was that it was a well-run facility that cared for people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12258)|
| 3:24:23| yet you put them in an unsafe building out of rezoning, out of zoning in an unsafe building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12263)|
| 3:24:28| Well, Commissioner, I wouldn't concede that they're in an unsafe building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12268)|
| 3:24:33| It may not be presently sprinkled, but...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12273)|
| 3:24:36| If it catches fire, it's unsafe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12276)|
| 3:24:39| Well...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12279)|
| 3:24:41| Is it a non-smoking facility?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12281)|
| 3:24:45| They can smoke outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12285)|
| 3:24:47| Today, or, I mean, is it...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12287)|
| 3:24:49| They can smoke outside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12289)|
| 3:24:53| Yeah, I guess this is one of those asking for forgiveness instead of permission deals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12293)|
| 3:24:57| and that's where I struggle with this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12297)|
| 3:24:58| And the location I struggle with somewhat as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12298)|
| 3:25:01| but I struggle with the fact that we're boarding 35 people in a home that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12301)|
| 3:25:07| or in a facility, it's not even a home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12307)|
| 3:25:09| that's not set up for it, nor is it zoned for it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12309)|
| 3:25:12| nor does it meet fire code regulations or zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12312)|
| 3:25:15| Well, we certainly intend to get it up to code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12315)|
| 3:25:19| which this whole process has initiated, and this is kind of the first step,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12319)|
| 3:25:25| is getting the proper zoning in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12325)|
| 3:25:28| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12328)|
| 3:25:30| Schoonmaker. Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12330)|
| 3:25:35| I did want to reiterate what Ms. Klein said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12335)|
| 3:25:39| so everybody understood that at the MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12339)|
| 3:25:42| there was no opposition testimony given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12342)|
| 3:25:45| because they were under the impression that it was delayed for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12345)|
| 3:25:51| when actually the case was heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12351)|
| 3:25:53| So that's why in your packet you have no information that actually shows up that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12353)|
| 3:25:57| or if you looked at the minutes, that there was opposition to this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12357)|
| 3:26:03| Second, in Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12363)|
| 3:26:07| we do not have a zoning classification for this type of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12367)|
| 3:26:13| If this was in the city of Knoxville, they do have a zoning classification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12373)|
| 3:26:18| My suggestion at this point would be that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12378)|
| 3:26:21| since this business has been operating for more than a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12381)|
| 3:26:23| that it be allowed to continue to operate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12383)|
| 3:26:26| while we delay or postpone a decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12386)|
| 3:26:31| until MPC has an opportunity to draft regulations for halfway houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12391)|
| 3:26:39| and then at that point we could revisit this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12399)|
| 3:26:46| Second. Commissioner Mastrom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12406)|
| 3:26:50| I would also second what Commissioner Schoonmaker said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12410)|
| 3:26:54| about having a chance to review the particular zoning on this type of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12414)|
| 3:27:00| I'll be also blunt and transparent on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12420)|
| 3:27:03| This is one that's really got me in a bind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12423)|
| 3:27:06| I've known Ms. Webb for 32 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12426)|
| 3:27:09| I grew up with her children,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12429)|
| 3:27:11| and they've always been a very close, dear friend of my family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12431)|
| 3:27:14| And I've never known her or any member of her family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12434)|
| 3:27:16| to do anything that they didn't think was right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12436)|
| 3:27:21| So I do want to thank Ms. Webb| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12441)|
| 3:27:24| for working hard to try and do something with your property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12444)|
| 3:27:27| to try and help people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12447)|
| 3:27:30| But I do have to acknowledge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12450)|
| 3:27:33| this business has been open for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12453)|
| 3:27:37| and I guess, back to what Commissioner Schoonmaker had said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12457)|
| 3:27:41| one error perhaps on our part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12461)|
| 3:27:43| is that when they wanted to open this business,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12463)|
| 3:27:46| the zoning wasn't clear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12466)|
| 3:27:48| and thought that maybe they could with the transitional zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12468)|
| 3:27:52| So it sounds like it just wasn't clear enough on the front end.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12472)|
| 3:27:57| Otherwise, it may have avoided this whole situation in the first place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12477)|
| 3:28:01| So I think if it would come to a vote,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12481)|
| 3:28:04| I would probably support.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12484)|
| 3:28:06| We haven't made an official motion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12486)|
| 3:28:08| but I would probably support a motion of the ILP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12488)|
| 3:28:10| along with what Mr. Schoonmaker had said around maybe delaying it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12490)|
| 3:28:14| just to get some further clarification on this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12494)|
| 3:28:16| Can I get a point of clarification, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12496)|
| 3:28:19| Was a CO granted by the county for this to be a residential facility| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12499)|
| 3:28:23| from recently being a vet, I guess, and a boarding?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12503)|
| 3:28:28| Was a CO granted for that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12508)|
| 3:28:30| Certificate of democracy was given?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12510)|
| 3:28:36| I would ask that you please approach the microphone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12516)|
| 3:28:38| give your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12518)|
| 3:28:53| Holly Evans, 717 Ebenezer Road, Knoxville, Tennessee, 37923.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12533)|
| 3:28:59| Thank you. I'm sorry I interrupted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12539)|
| 3:29:01| I think the question that was asked that you were trying to answer was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12541)|
| 3:29:04| a certificate of occupancy ever granted by the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12544)|
| 3:29:07| No, it wasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12547)|
| 3:29:11| What do I need to say here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12551)|
| 3:29:13| Oh, you've answered the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12553)|
| 3:29:15| John King, Market Street, Knoxville, Tennessee,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12555)|
| 3:29:20| along with Mr. Garceau representing the applicant here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12560)|
| 3:29:25| I think the best way to answer that was a certificate of occupancy was not obtained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12565)|
| 3:29:32| There was advice or otherwise information given to her that it was not needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12572)|
| 3:29:44| She did pursue information about what she needed to do before she started operating.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12584)|
| 3:29:53| Is there email proof of that? I'd like to see that if there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12593)|
| 3:29:57| I don't know whether there's email on it or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12597)|
| 3:29:59| I'd like to see that if there is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12599)|
| 3:30:01| I'm reluctant to go far down this path, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12601)|
| 3:30:08| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12608)|
| 3:30:10| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12610)|
| 3:30:12| I have a question for Dan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12612)|
| 3:30:14| Dan, can you explain the similar use determination process, what that looks like?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12614)|
| 3:30:21| Under a number of the different zoning classifications in the zoning ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12621)|
| 3:30:27| there is a list of permitted uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12627)|
| 3:30:30| And as in the OB zone, there is a list of uses that are permitted anywhere in that zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12630)|
| 3:30:38| Then there is a statement there that says,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12638)|
| 3:30:41| any other use similar in character to those enumerated above, usually meaning the other permitted uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12641)|
| 3:30:49| as approved by the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12649)|
| 3:30:52| And it is, while it doesn't specifically amend the ordinance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12652)|
| 3:30:59| there is some precedence that when a similar use determination is made,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12659)|
| 3:31:04| by the Planning Commission with regard to a particular use being similar to the others,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12664)|
| 3:31:11| the billing official, Roy Braden, right now, makes similar use determinations every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12671)|
| 3:31:18| Because every use that you think of that's out there is not listed in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12678)|
| 3:31:25| And that's a good thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12685)|
| 3:31:26| You won't find a tanning bed or a tanning salon listed anywhere in the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12686)|
| 3:31:33| But at some point, somebody has made a determination as to what zones they can go in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12693)|
| 3:31:39| And what this does, what the similar use determination does,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12699)|
| 3:31:44| is take that authority and give that to the Planning Commission in this particular case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12704)|
| 3:31:49| We ran into this earlier this evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12709)|
| 3:31:51| We have no designation of a jail diversion unit within the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12711)|
| 3:31:56| Looking at the zoning in the area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12716)|
| 3:31:59| I'm assuming you based the OB recommendation upon the fact that there is an OB piece of property next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12719)|
| 3:32:06| Is that a weighing factor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12726)|
| 3:32:08| That was a factor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12728)|
| 3:32:10| There is other areas that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12730)|
| 3:32:11| the sector plan includes a larger area that shows for medium density and or office use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12731)|
| 3:32:18| other than just those two pieces of property right on the corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12738)|
| 3:32:22| There is a larger area in that particular location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12742)|
| 3:32:27| Do you ever look at a zoning such as the OB zoning where the storage space is located?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12747)|
| 3:32:34| Do you ever look at a zoning such as the OB zoning where the storage center is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12754)|
| 3:32:42| And you look at the broad range of things that can happen within an OB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12762)|
| 3:32:46| And does it ever change your mind that that necessarily wouldn't be a matching type of conformity use?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12766)|
| 3:32:53| OB is a zone that is used quite frequently as a transition between commercial zoning and residential zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12773)|
| 3:33:02| There are a number of uses that I would think under permitted uses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12782)|
| 3:33:10| I guess a funeral home would probably be the most intensive use that would be permitted in the OB zone as a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12790)|
| 3:33:17| But there are a number of things under the use on review category.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12797)|
| 3:33:21| And as a use on review, there are a number of uses that may be more objectable| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12801)|
| 3:33:29| when adjoining a residential area than in others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12809)|
| 3:33:34| And Planning Commission, of course, looks at use on reviews on a case-by-case basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12814)|
| 3:33:39| Okay, so you're saying it's used as a zone as a transitional area between more defined and dense commercial.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12819)|
| 3:33:46| How far away is that dense commercial?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12826)|
| 3:33:49| I guess Kingston Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12829)|
| 3:33:51| Kingston Pike, but as you come up Peters Road, as you come up primarily Peters Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12831)|
| 3:34:00| every one of those houses on Peters Road up to practically this location have been converted to some type of office use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12840)|
| 3:34:10| What is that crossroad that connects from Peters to Ebenezer?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12850)|
| 3:34:15| Does anyone know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12855)|
| 3:34:18| Any other day I would, but not...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12858)|
| 3:34:21| No, it cuts right...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12861)|
| 3:34:24| There's an office building on...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12864)|
| 3:34:26| Yeah, in front of the electrical.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12866)|
| 3:34:28| I don't think that has a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12868)|
| 3:34:30| Oh, it's got to have a name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12870)|
| 3:34:32| George Williams.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12872)|
| 3:34:34| Is that George Williams?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12874)|
| 3:34:36| Okay, from George Williams on, there is a park, and what else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12876)|
| 3:34:41| There's a park on the left-hand side, on the south side of George Williams there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12881)|
| 3:34:45| Dunn Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12885)|
| 3:34:47| Dunn Park, and to the right, how many adjacent pieces of property are there before you get to this property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12887)|
| 3:34:53| There is an attorney's office that I'm aware of that is to the south of George Williams Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12893)|
| 3:35:01| Where you're talking about, George Williams Road is the road that the middle school is on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12901)|
| 3:35:08| No, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12908)|
| 3:35:10| To the east it also goes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12910)|
| 3:35:11| Right, but the one that you're talking about is a little bit further back, and there is an office building on that, and I don't recall what the name of it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12911)|
| 3:35:20| But to the north of that road there is an attorney's office that I'm aware of that's kind of in the swag right there, not too far from this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12920)|
| 3:35:36| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12936)|
| 3:35:38| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12938)|
| 3:35:40| Of course, with the opioid epidemic out there, we may need to look at MPC looking at zoning for that, but that's beside the point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12940)|
| 3:35:52| Mr. Law Director, they're illegal as they're doing now, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12952)|
| 3:35:57| Mm-hmm.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12957)|
| 3:36:01| There is not a use identified in the transition zone that would conform to the use that I understand is on the ground at this time, and that's why they've asked for the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12961)|
| 3:36:13| But they do not have an occupancy, they did not apply for any applique permits to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12973)|
| 3:36:18| Not as I understand the testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12978)|
| 3:36:21| So if they, even if we approved it tonight, which I'm doubting I would vote for, to get it up to codes, they would have to move residents out probably to get it up to the codes and sprinklers and all that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12981)|
| 3:36:36| Well, to be fair to the applicant, I don't think that that's the case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12996)|
| 3:36:39| I think they've applied for the rezoning in order to get to the next stage, which would be a similar use determination,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=12999)|
| 3:36:47| and it would have indicated that they're willing to work with MPC to establish those criteria at the location for the use that they plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13007)|
| 3:37:01| But like I said, that's something that's on down the road if the rezoning is approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13021)|
| 3:37:08| Just for the information, I know everybody knows that, but once we vote on this, this will go, it's out of our hands in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13028)|
| 3:37:17| The zoning goes with the land, like the lady said, and any further discussions will be at MPC under use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13037)|
| 3:37:27| And use on review will be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals at that point in time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13047)|
| 3:37:32| So just keep in mind that how we vote tonight takes that out of our hands forever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13052)|
| 3:37:40| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13060)|
| 3:37:42| I'd like to make a motion that we defer this item for 120 days to allow the Metropolitan Planning Commission to establish a proper zoning designation for halfway houses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13062)|
| 3:37:53| and if they cannot get it accomplished in 120 days, the director of the MPC can appear before us and request additional time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13073)|
| 3:38:02| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13082)|
| 3:38:03| Continuing discussion on the rezoning, the issue that is before us is the rezoning and not the use, and the rezoning that is before us is embedded in the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13083)|
| 3:38:29| and the Metropolitan Planning Commission staff has come to us saying the applicant has satisfied those requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13109)|
| 3:38:39| Now, they may be illegally operating, but that, as we have noticed, is Roy Braden, the mayor of Knox County's department, to take care of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13119)|
| 3:38:52| We only have before us not the use, not the code violations, but just whether or not the applicant has satisfied the requirements of the sector plan to be rezoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13132)|
| 3:39:08| Mr. Chairman, are you telling us how to vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13148)|
| 3:39:10| No, I'm telling you the facts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13150)|
| 3:39:12| Do you disagree with the facts?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13152)|
| 3:39:15| No, I don't disagree with the facts, but I think we all have opinions to it. I wasn't planning on voting on the use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13155)|
| 3:39:25| Right. We were voting on the rezoning and what has been offered in this motion, which is what I'm speaking to, the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13165)|
| 3:39:32| Well, this motion says that we're going to delay it until MPC works on doing a zoning that this business is doing, give them an opportunity to rezone the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13172)|
| 3:39:47| Well, we disagree with what we have worked on since 1955 as a plan. We disagree with the plan and we want to change the plan now because the application is before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13187)|
| 3:40:01| That's not planned by the rules. That's why you have rules. But that's just my opinion, strictly my opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13201)|
| 3:40:09| Before you finish, Commissioner, I believe Bob Thomas may have been next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13209)|
| 3:40:15| Commissioner Bob Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13215)|
| 3:40:18| Bob is fine. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13218)|
| 3:40:21| Just a quick question for the applicant. Whether it's delayed like Mr. Schoonmaker just proposed, what is the opinion of the applicant on some of the concerns brought up about the safety of this facility as it's being operated right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13221)|
| 3:40:42| And how is that going to be handled?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13242)|
| 3:40:46| I think Mr. King has a comment on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13246)|
| 3:40:48| Commissioner, in response to your question and perhaps related to the motion and all here, it's anticipated, we expected that there would be, shall we say, colloquy and discussion between us and the fire officials and MPC as to types of things that they believed to be appropriate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13248)|
| 3:41:18| To be necessary to operate the facility in the manner that it is currently operated. We understand and expect that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13278)|
| 3:41:29| So that's not new and that has to do with the safety issues.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13289)|
| 3:41:33| The thing about the delay is that what's going to be occurring to get to the point where we are back in front of a regulatory body asking for approval of that use, there's going to be a lot that has to go on before you reach that stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13293)|
| 3:42:01| And you've mentioned a number of the types of officials that are going to be involved in regulating that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13321)|
| 3:42:12| But it makes more sense and it makes, if you will, any proposed use like this more easily sought if you've got a zoning where you at least have a shot of being able to get that use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13332)|
| 3:42:33| You're going to spend a lot of money with the things that you're going to be doing with the fire officials or MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13353)|
| 3:42:44| And if you delay it, what you're doing is you're spending a lot of money and you still don't even know if you're going to get the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13364)|
| 3:42:54| It may be a chicken and egg thing, but as a matter of practicality, it's rather difficult to get things in place to spend the kind of money you're going to spend if you don't have a location that you're at least permitted to make the use that you want ultimately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13374)|
| 3:43:16| So my response is we know that there are going to be a number of things required.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13396)|
| 3:43:24| They're prepared to spend the money when they know what those requirements are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13404)|
| 3:43:29| But they'd like to at least be able to be in a position where they've got a piece of ground that they can put that use on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13409)|
| 3:43:38| And that's the reason for the rezoning request going forward at this time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13418)|
| 3:43:49| We observe, as you do, there's nothing in the ordinance that sets out precisely what it is that we do and the way we operate as a defined type of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13429)|
| 3:44:04| And again, as Mr. Kelly said, that's not uncommon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13444)|
| 3:44:10| It occurs there's a process in place to deal with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13450)|
| 3:44:14| And that process is what we're pursuing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13454)|
| 3:44:18| We'll be asking for a use determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13458)|
| 3:44:23| Once we get this rezoning, we want to get a use determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13463)|
| 3:44:27| And they'll either tell us at that time whether we can go forward or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13467)|
| 3:44:32| If they say, yeah, then I can be pretty much assured there's going to be a lot of conditions to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13472)|
| 3:44:39| And we'll either meet them or we won't be able to open up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13479)|
| 3:44:44| So with all due respect, and I understand the interest of the commission members who suggest that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13484)|
| 3:44:52| but it is a significant and important use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13492)|
| 3:45:01| The purpose it serves is of interest to everybody in the law enforcement field and the medical field.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13501)|
| 3:45:14| And they've got a good team put together to deliver the services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13514)|
| 3:45:21| Now, they're not really a halfway house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13521)|
| 3:45:23| But once again, I don't need to get into all of that explanation here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13523)|
| 3:45:27| That's going to come in due course.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13527)|
| 3:45:30| But what we're asking is that it be rezoned, let us try to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13530)|
| 3:45:37| and we'll get to the fire officials and we'll get to the MPC planners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13537)|
| 3:45:46| And I'm sure they're going to adequately represent the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13546)|
| 3:45:54| Commissioner Anders?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13554)|
| 3:45:56| Yeah, follow up on that a little bit, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13556)|
| 3:45:58| Don't sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13558)|
| 3:46:01| If there's no regulations for them to follow up on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13561)|
| 3:46:06| what are they going to draw their conclusions with?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13566)|
| 3:46:10| You say that you're going to tell us what we need to operate this facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13570)|
| 3:46:14| We don't have recommendations to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13574)|
| 3:46:15| We don't have zoning or coding to recommend recommendations to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13575)|
| 3:46:21| Well, I think that relates to just the subject matter of what this facility does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13581)|
| 3:46:30| But as far as fire safety and the other issues that I've heard expressed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13590)|
| 3:46:36| Dan, you correct me if I'm wrong,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13596)|
| 3:46:38| but I believe there's a way, if you will, for them to be involved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13598)|
| 3:46:47| in determining what the structure or structures need in order to get their approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13607)|
| 3:46:53| before any occupancy is going to be permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13613)|
| 3:46:59| I'll yield to Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13619)|
| 3:47:01| I mean, it would almost be an occupancy of a motel, a hotel-motel extended stay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13621)|
| 3:47:08| I mean, that's essentially what it's a supervised extended stay is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13628)|
| 3:47:13| they pay by the week for services and assistance and, I mean, housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13633)|
| 3:47:21| I guess my next question, Mr. Kelly, is did the MPC in this zoning staff recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13641)|
| 3:47:28| and I'll try to look through it again as quick as I could,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13648)|
| 3:47:31| but did they consider what the current use is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13651)|
| 3:47:36| or do they have to be blind to that because?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13656)|
| 3:47:42| The issue that was before the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13662)|
| 3:47:44| and I think the recommendation that you got from the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13664)|
| 3:47:48| is what they believe the appropriate zone for the property is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13668)|
| 3:47:53| I don't think they addressed the issue of what the current use of the property is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13673)|
| 3:47:59| with regard to whether it was permitted or not permitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13679)|
| 3:48:03| I think they looked at it as just, is this a good location for OB office zoning?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13683)|
| 3:48:10| How long is it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13690)|
| 3:48:11| When did codes inform the company that they couldn't occupy the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13691)|
| 3:48:17| or they were out of compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13697)|
| 3:48:19| When did that happen?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13699)|
| 3:48:22| September.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13702)|
| 3:48:23| I believe it was September of 2016,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13703)|
| 3:48:25| and they've granted extensions permitting the occupancy pending a decision on the zoning decisions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13705)|
| 3:48:34| and then the use determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13714)|
| 3:48:36| So they've given you until we figure out what MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13716)|
| 3:48:41| and Knox County Commission can come to an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13721)|
| 3:48:44| They've given you permission to occupy that until then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13724)|
| 3:48:47| He comes every 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13727)|
| 3:48:50| He comes every 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13730)|
| 3:48:51| That's what he's been doing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13731)|
| 3:48:55| I just struggle with this because it's been out of compliance for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13735)|
| 3:49:03| and I understand the process takes a little bit of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13743)|
| 3:49:05| So October is not totally out of the, you know, August or September is not totally out of the realm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13745)|
| 3:49:10| of it taking this long to figure out what needs to be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13750)|
| 3:49:13| I get that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13753)|
| 3:49:14| I struggle with us stamping approval on something that's illegal and out of code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13754)|
| 3:49:20| You're granting somebody permission after they've broken the law,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13760)|
| 3:49:24| and I struggle with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13764)|
| 3:49:26| That's my struggle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13766)|
| 3:49:28| Hey, if it was a campus facility built for this that had cabins and dorms and all that, I'm with you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13768)|
| 3:49:33| I think it's a good spot, potentially a good spot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13773)|
| 3:49:36| But you've operated out of compliance for a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13776)|
| 3:49:38| and I struggle with stamping affirming that as a zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13778)|
| 3:49:43| because then you're giving the next guy the permission to go set up an illegal business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13783)|
| 3:49:47| and making it your accepted practice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13787)|
| 3:49:49| Practice becomes policy, and I think that's a bad precedent for the commission to set.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13789)|
| 3:49:55| That's my only grief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13795)|
| 3:49:56| Commissioner Andrews, you still have the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13796)|
| 3:49:58| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13798)|
| 3:49:59| Mr. Kelly wanted to say something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13799)|
| 3:50:00| You're still on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13800)|
| 3:50:02| I guess my statement would be if the property is zoned OB, it's not a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13802)|
| 3:50:08| What's going on right now is not a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13808)|
| 3:50:11| If the rezoning request is denied, it's not a permitted use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13811)|
| 3:50:16| but it's going on right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13816)|
| 3:50:18| So I don't know that they're really a whole lot closer because it's not a permitted use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13818)|
| 3:50:25| They're going to have to convince somebody that what they're doing there is similar to any other use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13825)|
| 3:50:32| that should be or could be permitted in the OB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13832)|
| 3:50:36| And at this point, they haven't crossed over into that part of the party yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13836)|
| 3:50:45| And then, Commissioner Andrews, we begin to see if we look in the focus of what's before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13845)|
| 3:50:53| it's just a rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13853)|
| 3:50:55| It's not about were they in noncompliance because the use is not what's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13855)|
| 3:51:04| That's before Roy Braden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13864)|
| 3:51:06| But we won't have any control of that use, and I simply don't think that's good policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13866)|
| 3:51:13| We're going this way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13873)|
| 3:51:16| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13876)|
| 3:51:17| Commissioner Schoonmaker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13877)|
| 3:51:19| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13879)|
| 3:51:22| And this is directed to the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13882)|
| 3:51:25| If we did approve the OB zoning, this is a direct link or line to get the certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13885)|
| 3:51:35| If we denied it, they could not get a certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13895)|
| 3:51:39| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13899)|
| 3:51:42| I assume that the Code Enforcement Department has denied you a certificate of occupancy at this point| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13902)|
| 3:51:49| for the current zone, and they've applied for the rezoning because that is a pathway to a certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13909)|
| 3:51:56| Exactly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13916)|
| 3:51:57| But it's a pathway that goes through MPC, and it's an opportunity for MPC to impose additional conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13917)|
| 3:52:05| or make a determination if that use is appropriate in the OB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13925)|
| 3:52:11| If the MPC determines that that use is not appropriate in the OB zone, you've rezoned the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13931)|
| 3:52:17| but it's still not a permitted use, just as Dan said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13937)|
| 3:52:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13942)|
| 3:52:23| Chairman, I appreciate Commissioner Anders' comments, and I agree that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13943)|
| 3:52:32| here where a business has been operating illegally for more than a year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13952)|
| 3:52:37| but Knox County has said they can continue to operate until the legislative body rules.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13957)|
| 3:52:42| So I see no reason why we cannot take a 120-day delay to get our paperwork in order with MPC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13962)|
| 3:52:50| There's no reason to go ahead forward tonight and approve the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13970)|
| 3:52:58| Commissioner Bussler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13978)|
| 3:53:02| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13982)|
| 3:53:04| Mr. Kelly, have we ever had a precedent in the past where somebody's been out of compliance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13984)|
| 3:53:12| and we do a zoning to get them back in compliance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13992)|
| 3:53:18| Are you suggesting, have you ever given forgiveness?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=13998)|
| 3:53:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14001)|
| 3:53:22| I say that has occurred in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14002)|
| 3:53:24| I don't have any specifics, but sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14004)|
| 3:53:30| You sat on the Planning Commission long enough to probably have had the opportunity to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14010)|
| 3:53:35| I know it's come up before, but when I was, well, it's been years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14015)|
| 3:53:39| and we have lights now instead of we had candles back then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14019)|
| 3:53:42| That was long ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14022)|
| 3:53:43| But anyway, I don't remember an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14023)|
| 3:53:47| We dealt with that on the MPC where somebody was coming to ask forgiveness, as you'd say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14027)|
| 3:53:57| But I don't think we ever did that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14037)|
| 3:54:00| We went back to see, wonder why they were given permission that they were operating illegally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14040)|
| 3:54:10| or the codes department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14050)|
| 3:54:14| I don't know if I could be in favor of that because, again, we're offering something that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14054)|
| 3:54:25| okay, I've ran a red light, now I'm coming to ask you forgiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14065)|
| 3:54:28| I've already got a fine in my hand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14068)|
| 3:54:31| Now, forgive me for running a red light because I was there ten seconds too late.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14071)|
| 3:54:36| I guess the prime example that I can think of would be Hunter Valley Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14076)|
| 3:54:41| You know, they started out hosting birthday parties for kids, riding horses,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14081)|
| 3:54:46| and the next thing you know it's a wedding venue and they have something every weekend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14086)|
| 3:54:51| And then they got cited, and then the whole thing got, what do you have to do in order to get legal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14091)|
| 3:54:58| And they went through that process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14098)|
| 3:55:00| They didn't get an occupancy until they got legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14100)|
| 3:55:07| Okay, well, like I said, I don't remember doing that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14107)|
| 3:55:12| And you said Hunter Valley Farms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14112)|
| 3:55:15| Did we?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14115)|
| 3:55:17| You won't hear them, but they became bigger than their intentions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14117)|
| 3:55:21| and then we caused them to stop parties until they became in compliance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14121)|
| 3:55:27| There's no zoning for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14127)|
| 3:55:29| There's not a zoning for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14129)|
| 3:55:30| And there's no living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14130)|
| 3:55:33| So we don't have a zoning for it, but it's before us for zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14133)|
| 3:55:37| So the issue is even if we zoned it, it wouldn't be legal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14137)|
| 3:55:46| That's the trouble with this situation is there's this discussion that we're illegal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14146)|
| 3:55:52| but there's not any zone in the county that specifically permits this type of use, which can be changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14152)|
| 3:56:04| There's apartments all over Knox County that can be used for this very thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14164)|
| 3:56:09| There is a zoning for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14169)|
| 3:56:11| But I'm not against the campus dormitory stop, but you've been doing it for a year out of compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14171)|
| 3:56:17| and there is a safety issue there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14177)|
| 3:56:19| Even if we approve the zoning, there's nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14179)|
| 3:56:21| Nothing changes tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14181)|
| 3:56:23| And so what we're asking is let's draw up something that might work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14183)|
| 3:56:27| and see if we can rezone it at that time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14187)|
| 3:56:30| Are you finished, Commissioner Bussler?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14190)|
| 3:56:33| I think so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14193)|
| 3:56:36| Commissioner, Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14196)|
| 3:56:40| The motion, I understand it from Mr. Schoonmaker,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14200)|
| 3:56:44| is that it be postponed 120 days so that we can prepare regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14204)|
| 3:56:50| or make statements with regard to how we feel the use should be treated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14210)|
| 3:56:56| And what I need, I guess, would be some clarity in the motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14216)|
| 3:57:01| Are we talking about the entire drug and alcohol field where you're dealing with both inpatient, outpatient,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14221)|
| 3:57:09| counseling only, sober living?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14229)|
| 3:57:17| I don't know how many different ways that people are in the process of dealing with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14237)|
| 3:57:24| And if we're talking about writing regulations for all of those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14244)|
| 3:57:31| or are we looking at this particular use and seeing what they're doing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14251)|
| 3:57:38| and trying to come up with a set of regulations that would address that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14258)|
| 3:57:43| May I respond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14263)|
| 3:57:47| He asked you a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14267)|
| 3:57:50| I'm saying that the city of Knoxville has rules and regulations for Halfway House.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14270)|
| 3:57:56| I think we would start there and look at those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14276)|
| 3:57:59| and then that's why it's going to take a little bit of time to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14279)|
| 3:58:03| It's not something that's going to be done overnight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14283)|
| 3:58:05| But this is not what we're doing tonight right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14285)|
| 3:58:08| This is not the way to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14288)|
| 3:58:10| Halfway House is defined by the city or people who are coming out of incarceration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14290)|
| 3:58:14| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14294)|
| 3:58:17| As far as I know, these ladies that are down there are free to leave at any time they want.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14297)|
| 3:58:26| Commissioner Daley, just a second, please, just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14306)|
| 3:58:29| Mr. Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14309)|
| 3:58:32| Commissioner Smith had a question about the comments that were just made by Mr. Kelly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14312)|
| 3:58:37| Just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14317)|
| 3:58:39| Thank you, Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14319)|
| 3:58:41| Dan, I think we do need to look at this, the whole spectrum of services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14321)|
| 3:58:45| because our ordinances, our zoning ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14325)|
| 3:58:48| are vastly outdated upon the type of services that are needed in today's society.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14328)|
| 3:58:54| And these things are going to start coming at us really fast,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14334)|
| 3:58:57| and we don't need to be setting precedents on where we place these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14337)|
| 3:59:00| until we have things in place that do a good job of regulating it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14340)|
| 3:59:05| So I think that is something that not only us as a commission, but city council,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14345)|
| 3:59:10| need to be diving into and trying to get, I don't know if we can get ahead of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14350)|
| 3:59:15| but get far enough ahead of it that we can try to make it as easy, as transitional as possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14355)|
| 3:59:23| I agree completely with what you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14363)|
| 3:59:26| and part of what Ms. Klein's confusion was about the matter at MPC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14366)|
| 3:59:31| the Serenity House that was in the 9th District was on that same agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14371)|
| 3:59:37| It was postponed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14377)|
| 3:59:39| We had a request for another rezoning out on Ball Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14379)|
| 3:59:42| for a facility that was eventually withdrawn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14382)|
| 3:59:46| So there were three different items on that one agenda dealing with drug and alcohol.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14386)|
| 3:59:52| And they're going to keep coming, and we need these facilities,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14392)|
| 3:59:56| but we need to have a defined plan on where we're going to place them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14396)|
| 4:00:00| and how we're going to do it, a process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14400)|
| 4:00:02| I mean, if this zoning goes through tonight, it's going to come up for use on review,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14402)|
| 4:00:06| and they're not going to have a way to classify it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14406)|
| 4:00:10| Commissioner Daley.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14410)|
| 4:00:12| Mr. Schoonmaker, you bring your 3-in-1 oil for Mr. Anders' mic next time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14412)|
| 4:00:20| The question, I guess, or comment is that South Knoxville, and Dan knows this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14420)|
| 4:00:26| and we've been hit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14426)|
| 4:00:28| Forgive me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14428)|
| 4:00:29| I've started this business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14429)|
| 4:00:32| I want forgiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14432)|
| 4:00:33| I want the zoning to correct my mistake.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14433)|
| 4:00:36| I'm tired of these developers and businessmen going and starting a business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14436)|
| 4:00:42| and start developing and ask for forgiveness later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14442)|
| 4:00:45| It's got to stop sooner or later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14445)|
| 4:00:47| I am pro-sector plan, believe me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14447)|
| 4:00:51| I spent, Dan knows, I spent a lot of time going to sector plan meetings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14451)|
| 4:00:55| and I live by the sector plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14455)|
| 4:00:58| but I'm tired of developers and commercial businesses coming in and asking forgiveness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14458)|
| 4:01:04| instead of doing things the right way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14464)|
| 4:01:07| And I'm not for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14467)|
| 4:01:09| It's, I understand we have a BZA that can be used on review to there, but we're giving up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14469)|
| 4:01:18| If we vote tonight to approve this, we've given up what I think we should have some control over,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14478)|
| 4:01:26| and I believe that's what Commissioner Schoonmaker and Anders are all talking about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14486)|
| 4:01:31| So that's, I'm tired of forgiveness.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14491)|
| 4:01:34| And it's time for codes, and they have codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14494)|
| 4:01:37| He's bringing one before court on April 12th for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14497)|
| 4:01:40| It's time for codes to say, no, you've got 30 days to fix that or you're out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14500)|
| 4:01:47| That's it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14507)|
| 4:01:49| And that's one of the complications here is there's an. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14509)|
| 4:01:52| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14512)|
| 4:01:53| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14513)|
| 4:01:55| Mr. Chairman, it seems like if this was an insurance company| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14515)|
| 4:01:59| and there was no opposition, we'd have no problem changing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14519)|
| 4:02:05| How often, you know, I think it seems like if we hadn't done this extension,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14525)|
| 4:02:10| then I don't think if instead they had said like you just said there, Commissioner Daley,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14530)|
| 4:02:16| you have 30 days to fix it or quit, which might have been a better solution instead of an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14536)|
| 4:02:23| So that then pushes some of us into the position of doing an end around policing of sorts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14543)|
| 4:02:32| to make sure we get this thing in compliance by, even though it's not the usage,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14552)|
| 4:02:38| but possibly denying the rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14558)|
| 4:02:42| And I think that's where the problem lies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14562)|
| 4:02:45| Maybe it shouldn't have been given an extension.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14565)|
| 4:02:47| How long is this extension until?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14567)|
| 4:02:50| It's 30 days at a time, and it's renewed extensions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14570)|
| 4:02:54| And the problem is they cannot tell us you have 30 days to fix it because we don't know what. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14574)|
| 4:03:01| You don't know the zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14581)|
| 4:03:03| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14583)|
| 4:03:04| And so that's. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14584)|
| 4:03:05| I just. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14585)|
| 4:03:06| The codes enforcement has been very helpful in trying to give us extensions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14586)|
| 4:03:11| because they understand there's not a good call that can be made as far as zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14591)|
| 4:03:17| And, you know, Mr. Braden has said that the OB zone is probably the best place for this type of use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14597)|
| 4:03:26| And he's given us a written opinion that the type of use involved is similar to other uses in the OB zone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14606)|
| 4:03:36| And so it's trying to get the rezoning so then we can get a similar use determination.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14616)|
| 4:03:41| That's what we have to. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14621)|
| 4:03:42| You know, that's how we fix it here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14622)|
| 4:03:46| Still, in my mind, I'm thinking, well, if I've been doing this for a year| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14626)|
| 4:03:49| and it's obvious to me it's not a safe situation, why haven't I already fixed it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14629)|
| 4:03:55| Because we have no zoning for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14635)|
| 4:03:57| Well, but still, just in your mind, you say, you know, this is not. . .| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14637)|
| 4:04:00| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14640)|
| 4:04:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14641)|
| 4:04:03| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14643)|
| 4:04:05| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14645)|
| 4:04:08| When did you all first occupy the building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14648)|
| 4:04:12| May of 2015 or 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14652)|
| 4:04:17| I can't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14657)|
| 4:04:19| It was 2015 or 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14659)|
| 4:04:23| May of 2015 or 16.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14663)|
| 4:04:25| I can't recall.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14665)|
| 4:04:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14667)|
| 4:04:28| Does this type of business require a business license?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14668)|
| 4:04:30| It does.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14670)|
| 4:04:31| And you all applied for one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14671)|
| 4:04:32| Please approach the microphone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14672)|
| 4:04:35| I've been doing this for about 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14675)|
| 4:04:38| And when we came here, I guess I'll just leave it at I did try to go through the proper channels.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14678)|
| 4:04:45| And I thought I did what I was told to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14685)|
| 4:04:50| And, I mean, like I said, I've done this everywhere, several places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14690)|
| 4:04:56| And this is the nicest facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14696)|
| 4:04:59| You know, most of the time a lot of these houses, they're in rough areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14699)|
| 4:05:04| I mean, we're the top facility around.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14704)|
| 4:05:06| I work with eight drug courts, 20 counties, and we've got a good program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14706)|
| 4:05:11| Safety, the sprinkling thing, that's came up in my mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14711)|
| 4:05:17| But I'm willing to do anything that we need to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14717)|
| 4:05:20| You know, I mean, I plan on keeping that building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14720)|
| 4:05:24| But did you apply for a business license before you opened?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14724)|
| 4:05:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14727)|
| 4:05:28| And it did not require any inspection from the county to get your certificate of occupancy?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14728)|
| 4:05:32| No, I didn't get the certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14732)|
| 4:05:35| I never got that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14735)|
| 4:05:41| Call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14741)|
| 4:05:43| Commissioner Busler.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14743)|
| 4:05:47| Thank you, Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14747)|
| 4:05:51| We're brought to an issue right here, and we've got to remember, we've got the MPC to help us make the decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14751)|
| 4:05:57| We are basically the zoning board, but they're just bringing us recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14757)|
| 4:06:01| So we don't have to look up all that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14761)|
| 4:06:04| Is that right, Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14764)|
| 4:06:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14766)|
| 4:06:07| The decision whether to rezone this property or not is a legislative one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14767)|
| 4:06:10| It lies with this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14770)|
| 4:06:12| And what we have here is an issue where something is brought to us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14772)|
| 4:06:21| and to me it's one that should have been brought to us and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14781)|
| 4:06:25| we don't have a zoning for this, what do we need to do?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14785)|
| 4:06:28| And we'd say, okay, go back and make a zoning for it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14788)|
| 4:06:31| and make inspections for it before it ever got to this point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14791)|
| 4:06:35| And now here we are and we say, we've got this use here and we don't have a zoning for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14795)|
| 4:06:41| We just did a safety center that we don't, I don't know if we have really a zoning for that either,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14801)|
| 4:06:48| but we need something for that specific type issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14808)|
| 4:06:53| And I don't like to have it here when you put a sign up on use on review and it says office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14813)|
| 4:06:59| but, oh, you can have everything in there, but, and this is not an issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14819)|
| 4:07:06| I mean, this is not on that use on review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14826)|
| 4:07:09| So your neighbors next to you don't know what they're going to have next to them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14829)|
| 4:07:13| and they should have just as much right to know as the people that enforce this code and should let us know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14833)|
| 4:07:24| But how do we fix this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14844)|
| 4:07:26| Do we fix it now or do we say, okay, let's do 120 days and give us a recommendation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14846)|
| 4:07:35| and from now on this is how it's going to be so we don't have to be here this long.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14855)|
| 4:07:41| My wife's, my food's getting cold at the house, by the way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14861)|
| 4:07:46| Commissioner Schoonmaker, your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14866)|
| 4:07:48| Call the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14868)|
| 4:07:49| Your motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14869)|
| 4:07:51| The motion was to delay, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14871)|
| 4:08:00| We've been here so long I'm trying to think of the first word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14880)|
| 4:08:02| What did I say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14882)|
| 4:08:04| Take 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14884)|
| 4:08:08| Postpone, excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14888)|
| 4:08:09| Postpone for 120 days to allow the MPC to come up with an appropriate classification for this use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14889)|
| 4:08:20| I think that, did you second it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14900)|
| 4:08:22| He seconded it, and I called the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14902)|
| 4:08:25| Mr. Kelly, did you have a question about the clarity of the motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14905)|
| 4:08:31| My understanding is that we are looking at this specific type of facility that they're operating, very narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14911)|
| 4:08:39| Do you have a defined definition of what this type of facility is?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14919)|
| 4:08:45| I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14925)|
| 4:08:46| My understanding is it's a sober living facility, which typically those are people who have been through treatment programs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14926)|
| 4:08:52| They're not ready to go back to their everyday life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14932)|
| 4:08:55| A lot of times their everyday life is where they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14935)|
| 4:08:59| and they are living in these facilities until they get stronger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14939)|
| 4:09:07| The applicant's response to the motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14947)|
| 4:09:10| Is that proper?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14950)|

| 4:09:26| To delay, to postpone 120 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14966)|
| 4:09:33| The only concern I would have is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14973)|
| 4:09:36| Yes, I need to nail you down to a yes or a no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14976)|
| 4:09:42| Can I seek some clarity on what the motion involves?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14982)|
| 4:09:46| You're going to be delayed 120 days while MPC considers where this type of facility should be zoned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14986)|
| 4:09:54| Do we have to make changes during those 120 days until there's regulations in place?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14994)|
| 4:09:59| What we have before us tonight is strictly zoning, not a use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=14999)|
| 4:10:06| Or the use is under control of Roy Braden.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15006)|
| 4:10:12| Yes, we're fine with the 120 day postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15012)|
| 4:10:15| Commissioner Daley, are you speaking to the 120 day delay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15015)|
| 4:10:23| No, I've got a comment, but that's not the 120 day delay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15023)|
| 4:10:26| Commissioner Carringer, are you speaking to the 120 day delay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15026)|
| 4:10:31| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15031)|
| 4:10:33| If we delay it for 120 days, are they allowed to continue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15033)|
| 4:10:39| The use is not what's before us. It's the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15039)|
| 4:10:42| It's been stated as testimony that Knox County codes enforcement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15042)|
| 4:10:47| It gives them a 30 day window every month until the legislative body rules on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15047)|
| 4:10:55| So if we haven't ruled until September of next year, they're still going to be able to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15055)|
| 4:11:02| According to the testimony given by the –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15062)|

| 4:11:10| I do have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15070)|
| 4:11:12| Just a minute.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15072)|
| 4:11:20| Their 30 days window rolling is not guaranteed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15080)|
| 4:11:24| That's what we're trying to get done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15084)|
| 4:11:29| Well, we should have had Mr. Braden here to give his own testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15089)|
| 4:11:33| The use is not what's before us. The zoning is what's before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15093)|
| 4:11:37| Commissioner Carringer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15097)|
| 4:11:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15099)|
| 4:11:42| I want it to be clear that I don't think there's any of us up here that is against what your facility is doing and what it's about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15102)|
| 4:11:56| Now, we have facilities that operate like this in the county and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15116)|
| 4:12:02| What is their zone?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15122)|
| 4:12:04| I mean, like in terms of a – these aren't criminal women.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15124)|
| 4:12:09| These are women who have been through treatment facilities and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15129)|
| 4:12:14| So do we not have the facilities –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15134)|
| 4:12:21| I guess you bring in another thing when I'm talking about those that are with their kids and they go to shelters and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15141)|
| 4:12:33| But they don't have the addictions and all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15153)|
| 4:12:36| So we do not have – but when we say apply for occupancy, if you're housing for an addiction or any of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15156)|
| 4:12:46| is that just something that you would go through the county or do you have to go through state to get that clarification?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15166)|
| 4:12:53| Certificate of occupancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15173)|
| 4:12:54| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15174)|
| 4:12:55| I mean, when you're talking about doing more or less a rehab type,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15175)|
| 4:12:59| does it have to involve any of that, just strictly county?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15179)|
| 4:13:05| Well, it's amazing how it's gotten two years going and it's just now coming before us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15185)|
| 4:13:13| What was the delay with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15193)|
| 4:13:15| We are not in charge of enforcement of code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15195)|
| 4:13:21| Commissioner Gill.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15201)|
| 4:13:23| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15203)|
| 4:13:24| Will 120 days give MPC enough time to draft the appropriate language?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15204)|
| 4:13:30| I will discuss that with the director tomorrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15210)|
| 4:13:36| Seeing no further discussion, the motion is properly before us is to approve a 120-day delay, postponement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15216)|

| 4:14:21| They did not have a chance because there were three items, two of them were tabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15261)|
| 4:14:25| They were informed that the information was tabled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15265)|
| 4:14:28| and that things could have been different if they were not misinformed on information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15268)|

| 4:20:16| I think that we need to get together with city council and have some kind of joint meetings to try and figure out some of these zoning regulations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15616)|
| 4:20:23| Either we can do it as an individual body or we could do it with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15623)|
| 4:20:28| But there are a lot of things that we need to address to get ahead of here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15628)|
| 4:20:32| And if we don't start moving towards that, we're going to find ourselves in a lot of these bad positions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15632)|
| 4:20:40| I will place a phone call to the vice mayor, Mr. Greaves, and ask if he wants to have a joint meeting with us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15640)|
| 4:20:48| And I will report back at the next board of zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15648)|
| 4:20:52| Can I suggest a similar setup that you have with the school system, maybe three or four, and kind of keep the discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15652)|
| 4:21:00| I mean, you get more done with eight people than you can with 17.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15660)|
| 4:21:05| Well, they may not want to talk to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15665)|
| 4:21:07| Very true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15667)|
| 4:21:08| I think maybe we should have our own also of two or three and then work with them in a group debate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15668)|
| 4:21:17| We will have to work as a full commission to have discussion to maybe empower a group of three.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15677)|
| 4:21:24| But that will be after our next zoning meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15684)|
| 4:21:28| Commissioner Daly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15688)|
| 4:21:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15690)|
| 4:21:31| I would love to see anyone tomorrow night at Low That Barbecue to ask the commissioner and the good and the bad, whichever it may be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15691)|
| 4:21:40| Commissioner Thomas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15700)|
| 4:21:41| I just want to remind people that might be interested in the Knox County Criminal Courts having a 110th anniversary dinner this Friday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15701)|
| 4:21:48| It's at the Foundry Reception.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CoCom170327?start=15708)|
