| 0:02:48| postponing it? We're withdrawing it. It'll come back. It needs to be redone. Yes. It's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=168)|
| 0:02:53| a different format. Anything else to be withdrawn? Items for postponement? Councilman Stair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=173)|
| 0:03:02| Thank you Mayor. I'd request that 11A be postponed to the July 18th meeting. To July| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=182)|
| 0:03:08| 18th. So that's four weeks. Okay. That's the resolution honoring our Deputy Police Chief| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=188)|
| 0:03:19| Rudy Bradley. So is there a second? Second. Any discussion? All in favor say aye. Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=199)|
| 0:03:28| Any opposed? That will be heard on July 18th. Councilwoman Palmer. Thank you. I'd like to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=208)|
| 0:03:39| move that we postpone 9C, D, and E for two weeks. 9C, D, and E. That's the second reading| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=219)|
| 0:03:50| on the Martin Mill zoning? Correct. Okay. Second. Postpone two weeks? Yes. Pardon me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=230)|
| 0:04:01| How many weeks? Mr. Seymour, two, four, or six? No, it's July the 6th. Right, two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=241)|
| 0:04:10| which is actually two weeks and two days. Yeah, thank you. Okay. Yes, two weeks to your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=250)|
| 0:04:16| next meeting. Okay, thank you. Right, to the next meeting, which is July 6th. Which is July the 4th, I guess, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=256)|
| 0:04:22| It's not July 4th. We won't be here. I think we ought to let Mr. Seymour come. Okay, so there's a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=262)|
| 0:04:31| motion on 9C, D, and E. That's dealing with the Martin Mill property. Postpone to our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=271)|
| 0:04:38| next meeting, which is July 6th. Did we get a second as well? Second. Okay, any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=278)|

| 0:04:55| else for postponement? Councilwoman, you want to turn that light on? Yes. Okay, anything| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=295)|
| 0:05:01| to be added by motion? Consent item through 11P through Q, certificates of compliance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=301)|
| 0:05:10| 11R through S, pensions, and 12B through Q, 202s. Move for approval. Second. Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=310)|

| 0:05:21| report, first I want to remind everyone of a few things ahead of the 4th of July holiday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=321)|
| 0:05:28| which is two weeks from today. City offices will be closed that day, and the City Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=328)|
| 0:05:34| meeting that would normally be held that night has been moved two days later to Thursday,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=334)|
| 0:05:39| July 6th, still at 6 p.m. All of our trash and recycling collection will operate as usual,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=339)|
| 0:05:45| so if you have normal pickup that day on Tuesday the 4th, make sure to put your carts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=345)|
| 0:05:50| out. And, of course, we will have our wonderful, fantastic festival on the 4th at World's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=350)|
| 0:05:56| Fair Park. Judith Foltz and our Office of Special Events do a great job putting this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=356)|
| 0:06:01| together every year, and that takes police, fire, public service, a lot of departments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=361)|
| 0:06:07| engineering, a lot of folks that get out there and are involved one way or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=367)|
| 0:06:11| The free festival begins at 4 p.m. with music and a lot of family activities. It ends, as| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=371)|
| 0:06:17| always, with the performance from the Knoxville Symphony Orchestra, and, of course, the fireworks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=377)|
| 0:06:22| The fireworks will start around 940 p.m. So remember, this event is rain or shine, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=382)|
| 0:06:28| come on out, regardless of the forecast. You can find all the details, including parking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=388)|
| 0:06:33| information, on the City website at knoxvilletn.gov slash 4th, which is the number 4 and then| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=393)|
| 0:06:42| TH. So that's next week, but this week we are celebrating Tri-Transit Week. We want| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=402)|
| 0:06:50| people to tri-transit, and Knoxville Area Transit has a full week of great events that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=410)|
| 0:06:56| are planned. Tri-Transit Week is a celebration of CAT's momentum and new services, as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=416)|
| 0:07:02| as an invitation to people who haven't used transit services to give CAT a try. I rode| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=422)|
| 0:07:09| the CAT bus, Route 20, out Central Street on Monday, and I was joined by Councilman| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=429)|
| 0:07:15| Saunders and Wallace and some CAT staff and City staff and some of the local business| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=435)|
| 0:07:20| people along Central Avenue. We made it right through the construction cones without any| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=440)|
| 0:07:25| trouble, so it's a reminder that those folks, that all of those businesses are open for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=445)|
| 0:07:30| business on Central Avenue in the Happy Holler area. So we had lunch at Central Flats and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=450)|
| 0:07:36| Taps and enjoyed it very much. And so that was what we did Monday for Tri-Transit Week,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=456)|
| 0:07:45| and tomorrow, Wednesday, June 21st, at 1 p.m., we will be at the Knoxville Station for a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=465)|
| 0:07:52| big announcement with the Director of Transit, Don Disler. We're not going to tell you what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=472)|
| 0:07:57| that is yet, but we invite everyone who's a fan of transit to come and share in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| celebration. And of course, Council, hopefully Council will be able to make it, those of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=482)|
| 0:08:07| you who can. If you want to try transit yourself, be sure to check out CAT's new website, which| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=487)|
| 0:08:13| is www.catbus.com. It's a new design. It's really easy to use and, in my opinion, a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=493)|
| 0:08:24| very big improvement over the last one. It includes a transit trip planner. You just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=504)|
| 0:08:29| type in where you're starting from and where you want to go, and you can get simple step-by-step| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=509)|
| 0:08:34| directions for using CAT to reach your destination. You can also sign up to receive text and email| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=514)|
| 0:08:40| alerts notifying you if your route goes on detour. And also, if you've never ridden| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=520)|
| 0:08:48| transit and you would, and you're worried about knowing what to do, there are actually| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=528)|
| 0:08:53| videos on the website that explain that to you. So you can look at that. I'll show you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=533)|
| 0:08:58| exactly what to do to ride transit. So then, so that's on Wednesday, June 21st. I talked| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=538)|
| 0:09:05| about that. And now, to end the week on Friday of this week, all rides on CAT will be fare-free.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=545)|
| 0:09:13| Every route in town, to celebrate Tri-Transit Week, fare-free this Friday, June 23rd. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=553)|
| 0:09:20| if you've not used it, if you're regular, you get a freebie that day. If you've never| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=560)|
| 0:09:24| tried it, hopefully that will be an incentive. Okay, so we'll have another announcement next| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=564)|
| 0:09:30| Tuesday, June 27th at 3.30 p.m. in the fifth floor atrium here in the City-County Building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=570)|
| 0:09:39| As we all know, this is an important election year for City Council. We have five seats| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=579)|
| 0:09:43| that will be open. Unfortunately, we'll be losing five of you that are up here. But we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=583)|
| 0:09:49| have five seats open, and there are about 30-some candidates that are running for those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=589)|
| 0:09:53| five seats. So we want to encourage voter education, participation, and turnout. So| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=593)|
| 0:09:59| we're going to do a series of activities over the summer to build election awareness| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=599)|
| 0:10:05| and excitement in the community. So please join me and Vice Mayor Grieve and other Council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=605)|
| 0:10:11| members on Tuesday at 3.30 p.m. for the kickoff of the project. And we've also invited all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=611)|
| 0:10:20| the candidates for City Council to be there as well. So everyone should have gotten their| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=620)|
| 0:10:26| invitation today. So that's next Tuesday, 3.30 at the fifth floor atrium. Okay, and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=626)|
| 0:10:34| now there are some well-deserved recognitions we want to make. First of all, I was really| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=634)|
| 0:10:42| honored to travel to Nashville last week with some of our staff on behalf of the City to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=642)|
| 0:10:48| receive the 2017 Governor's Environmental Stewardship Award for Suttery Landing Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=648)|
| 0:10:54| I guess, we didn't bring those actual awards, did we? I didn't think about it. Anyway, we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=654)|
| 0:11:01| have two beautiful, we have a plaque and a really nice little, what do you call those?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=661)|
| 0:11:08| Like a little trophy thing, but it's glass, recycled glass. So this was the 2017 Governor's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=668)|
| 0:11:16| Environmental Stewardship Award for Suttery Landing Park. The award was presented by Governor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=676)|
| 0:11:21| Haslam and by TDEC Commissioner Bob Martineau. It recognized all the work that many of our| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=681)|
| 0:11:26| city departments put into transforming that blighted brownfield into a beautiful Riverside| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=686)|
| 0:11:33| Park. The awards recognize exceptional voluntary actions that improve or protect Tennessee's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=693)|
| 0:11:40| environment and natural resources with projects or initiatives not required by law or regulation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=700)|
| 0:11:47| Our Redevelopment Director, Dawn Michelle, and our Deputy Director, Ann Wallace, Dawn| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=707)|
| 0:11:53| Michelle Foster, sorry, and our Deputy Director, Ann Wallace, joined me for the ceremony along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=713)|
| 0:11:58| with Sustainability Director Aaron Gill. And I also want to recognize, oh and Brian Berry| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=718)|
| 0:12:04| went with us as well from Redevelopment. Also, we want to thank Parks and Recreation Director| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=724)|
| 0:12:09| Joe Walsh and all of his team and our Engineering Department, particularly Sean Fitzpatrick| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=729)|
| 0:12:15| and Martin Bradley. All of these folks worked on that park. It was a team effort and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=735)|
| 0:12:20| results speak for themselves. So we do have those awards in the various departments, so| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=740)|
| 0:12:26| they're going to share those. Okay, and now, last but not least, we have State Representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=746)|
| 0:12:33| Rick Staples and did our State Senator, Becky Massey, did she make it yet? Okay, she's not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=753)|
| 0:12:41| here, but they co-sponsored a resolution that State Rep. Staples will present. So I'm| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=761)|
| 0:12:51| sure council members remember that in April, we had a fire at an apartment building on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=771)|
| 0:12:56| Magnolia Avenue where several of our Knoxville firefighters performed truly heroic rescue| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=776)|
| 0:13:03| work. To show their recognition and appreciation of those actions, Senator Massey and Representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=783)|
| 0:13:10| Staples sponsored a resolution in the legislature. So I'd like to ask Representative Staples| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=790)|
| 0:13:17| to come forward and to say a few words about firefighters Eric Beaumaret and Kevin Tippins| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=797)|
| 0:13:24| and Captain David Frazier. And y'all will remember, we talked about this at council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=804)|
| 0:13:30| as well. Representative, you have the mic. Mayor O'Hara, Mayor Greaves, Mayor Brown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=810)|
| 0:13:39| thank you other council members. Thank you so much for letting me interrupt your council| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=819)|
| 0:13:45| meeting to present this particular piece of legislative work. We were to do this in Nashville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=825)|
| 0:13:54| but right there towards the end, we got a little hectic and a little busy, so we couldn't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=834)|
| 0:13:58| really find the schedule to do it. If you allow me, Mayor, I would like to say it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=838)|
| 0:14:03| good to see the family of a community pillar, Margaret Gaither, here today. And I would| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=843)|
| 0:14:08| also ask you to remember former president of the Firefighters Association, Bill Warick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=848)|
| 0:14:15| Just Lost Team is a great community member and a great part of the Knoxville Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=855)|
| 0:14:21| First responders go out every day, leave their families to risk their lives for our families.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=861)|
| 0:14:29| In District 15, we lost two three-year-old children to fires. And having a relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=869)|
| 0:14:35| with members of the Knoxville Fire Department, I know it took its toll on several people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=875)|
| 0:14:42| losing those young people. But they're dedicated, they have great leadership, and the young| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=882)|
| 0:14:50| man firefighter, Bo Merritt, answered a call to save a child's life so we wouldn't lose| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=890)|
| 0:14:57| another one. And we're so grateful and we're so thankful for that under the leadership| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=897)|
| 0:15:02| of Captain Frazier. The work that Quint 4 did on that day on Magnolia Avenue so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=902)|
| 0:15:09| wouldn't lose another life to fire was so impressive. It was so heroic that we decided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=909)|
| 0:15:20| to honor that from the state legislator. So to the gentlemen of Quint 4, we present to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=920)|
| 0:15:26| you on behalf of the 110th General Assembly, signed by our Honorable Governor Bill Haslam,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=926)|
| 0:15:33| a Declaration and House Joint Resolution honoring your act of heroism on the day that you saved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=933)|
| 0:15:39| the life of that young baby on Magnolia Avenue. And we say thank you and if there's any way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=939)|
| 0:15:43| that we can ever serve you as members of the House of Representatives and Senate, please| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=943)|
| 0:15:48| don't hesitate to call. Thank you so much for your sacrifice and your work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=948)|
| 0:15:56| They're trying to take a picture, Mayor. Do we have your permission?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=956)|
| 0:16:11| Take a picture? Certainly. Go ahead, take a picture. And then I want to invite Bo and| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=971)|
| 0:16:16| Kevin and Captain Frazier to say a few words if you'd like. You know what, Representative| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=976)|
| 0:16:23| Staples. Yes, ma'am. Do you want to be in the picture, Mayor? Oh, is that what you're| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=983)|
| 0:16:27| asking? Well, yeah, because it's your city. I just want to make sure. Well, sure. Alright.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=987)|
| 0:16:58| Charles, you're a photo-bombing, aren't you? It's still just Charles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1018)|
| 0:17:17| Sure. But we don't have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1037)|
| 0:17:27| Here's a knock. There's one more. Oh, there's one more.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1047)|
| 0:17:44| I'd like to thank the Mayor and Council for recognizing us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1064)|
| 0:18:14| It's a great honor. The Mayor asked me to just briefly talk about what happened that day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1094)|
| 0:18:20| We got called to a structure fire at the bricks on Magnolia. As we pulled up in Quint 4, they told us the fire was around back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1100)|
| 0:18:30| At that time, I saw Engine 6 and 16 go ahead and pull around the back of the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1110)|
| 0:18:36| Senior Firefighter Merritt and myself went around the side of the building and saw seven people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1116)|
| 0:18:42| hanging out windows with heavy smoke coming from that window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1122)|
| 0:18:46| One of those people was a young man who had a baby wrapped in a blanket, holding it as far away from the smoke as he could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1126)|
| 0:18:54| And he told us, catch the baby. And it looked like he could lose the baby at any moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1134)|
| 0:19:01| So Senior Firefighter Merritt and myself got directly underneath the baby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1141)|
| 0:19:08| I got toward the apartment and Senior Firefighter Merritt got right there where the pavement was and said, OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1148)|
| 0:19:19| And he dropped the baby. Bo made a great catch. I just stood underneath and made sure that he made a good catch.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1159)|
| 0:19:28| Apparently, I told the Titans to look at him in the off season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1168)|
| 0:19:34| So at that point, we handed the-| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1174)|
| 0:19:36| This was how many stories?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1176)|
| 0:19:38| Two and a half stories.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1178)|
| 0:19:41| And at that point, we checked the baby out and handed him off to the grandfather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1181)|
| 0:19:50| And the baby was fine. We had no idea that the baby was just a month old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1190)|
| 0:19:54| The baby was tiny, but in good condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1194)|
| 0:19:59| And at that point, I'd just like to say that everybody that was on that scene did a fantastic job.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1199)|
| 0:20:05| And Kevin Tippins is here. He was the driver.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1205)|
| 0:20:09| Yes, and the grandmother was still in the apartment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1209)|
| 0:20:13| She had COPD, and I went up the ladder to get her out, and she couldn't come down the ladder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1213)|
| 0:20:19| So I gave her my SCBA mask, my oxygen mask, so she could breathe with all the smoke.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1219)|
| 0:20:26| And then Senior Firefighter Tippins went in with some oxygen and got her and rescued her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1226)|
| 0:20:32| Went into the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1232)|
| 0:20:33| Went into the building and rescued her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1233)|
| 0:20:35| And at that same time, Senior Firefighter Merritt had gone up another ladder to rescue another woman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1235)|
| 0:20:41| and a firefighter off Engine 16 had gone up and rescued a disabled man from a window.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1241)|
| 0:20:47| And without the leadership of Chief Pollard and Chief Mitchell, who were the chiefs that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1247)|
| 0:20:52| really just everybody did a fantastic job, and it was a successful rescue of many people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1252)|
| 0:20:58| And no one got injured, and it ended a good day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1258)|
| 0:21:04| So how many times have you caught a baby in your career?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| One.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1267)|
| 0:21:10| We never want to do it again, right? But if you have to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| No, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1272)|
| 0:21:13| Yeah, that's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1273)|
| 0:21:15| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1275)|
| 0:21:16| Thank you. And Chief Sharp, would you like to say something here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1276)|
| 0:21:22| Thank you, Mayor and members of Council, for giving us this opportunity to recognize our firefighters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1282)|
| 0:21:28| And thank you, Representative Staples and all of the other legislators who sponsored this resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1288)|
| 0:21:34| Needless to say, I'm very proud of these three specifically today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1294)|
| 0:21:40| but I'm proud of all our firefighters and for what they do every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1300)|
| 0:21:46| This is what our firefighters do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1306)|
| 0:21:48| They serve the citizens, they protect property, and they save lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1308)|
| 0:21:52| That's what they're here for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1312)|
| 0:21:54| And all of them, and I wrote this down in case I didn't remember it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1314)|
| 0:22:01| but I think Bo Merritt summed it up best when he talked to a reporter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1321)|
| 0:22:06| I think this is what any of our firefighters would say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1326)|
| 0:22:08| was I just happened to be in the right place at the right time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1328)|
| 0:22:11| Anybody with KFD would have done the same thing in that situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1331)|
| 0:22:16| And I think that's the perfect summation of what our firefighters represent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1336)|
| 0:22:20| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1340)|
| 0:22:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1341)|
| 0:22:28| To all the representatives of the Fire Department, we have four in the back there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1348)|
| 0:22:35| You said something that we often, that strikes me all the time, is how humble you all are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1355)|
| 0:22:43| and it is in a day's work, to you perhaps, but not to us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1363)|
| 0:22:48| You all run into the burning buildings while most of us would clamor to get out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1368)|
| 0:22:53| So we do appreciate you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1373)|
| 0:22:55| We talked about you at a council meeting right after it happened.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1375)|
| 0:22:58| I don't know if you know that, Bo.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1378)|
| 0:23:00| We talked about it with the chief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1380)|
| 0:23:03| But thank you for what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1383)|
| 0:23:05| Thank you, Representative Staples,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1385)|
| 0:23:08| and Senator Massey will let her know how much we appreciate what you all did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1388)|
| 0:23:13| And you want to add something else?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1393)|
| 0:23:15| I did, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1395)|
| 0:23:16| Forgive me for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1396)|
| 0:23:17| In the beginning, I didn't mention that Senator Massey had a minor procedure that was successful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1397)|
| 0:23:23| She was going to try to make it tonight, and she fell up to it, but she was recouping.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1403)|
| 0:23:26| So I forgot to mention that in the beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1406)|
| 0:23:28| Well, maybe she's watching.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1408)|
| 0:23:29| We'll know that we appreciate her as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1409)|
| 0:23:31| But to all the Fire Department, to our chief, Stan Sharp, thank you for what you do every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| You know, this happens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1417)|
| 0:23:38| There's acts of courage every day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1418)|
| 0:23:40| It's not always catching a baby, and that really gets even more attention than normal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1420)|
| 0:23:45| But thank you for what you do every single day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1425)|
| 0:23:48| Appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1428)|

| 0:28:01| is really the first one to suggest to me that I run for this office. And once I knew that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1681)|
| 0:28:08| her support, I said, I think I will run. So, she was certainly a great woman. Whereas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1688)|

| 0:28:52| with its Whitney M. Young Jr. Lifetime Award for their dedication in improving so many lives.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1732)|

| 0:29:06| of dedicated work. And whereas, Ms. Gator was a member of the Rogers Memorial Baptist| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1746)|

| 0:31:51| One of the things that I said was that she cared passionately about her community and her city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1911)|
| 0:31:56| She never gave an inch when it came to doing what she knew was right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1916)|
| 0:32:00| but her persistence came from kindness and empathy, never rancor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1920)|
| 0:32:04| We will really miss her strong, steady voice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1924)|
| 0:32:08| I know it was just, I think, the week before that she always called our office, the Mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1928)|
| 0:32:14| and would often talk to April if she didn't ask specifically for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1934)|
| 0:32:18| But she would let April know exactly what it was that we needed to get done,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1938)|
| 0:32:22| and then April would pass it on to the right department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1942)|
| 0:32:25| And so she did that up until, I want to say, her last breath.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1945)|
| 0:32:30| She made sure that we knew what needed to be done to make the community, our city, and our neighborhood better.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1950)|
| 0:32:36| So we appreciate that and we all will miss her very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=1956)|

| 0:34:59| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2099)|
| 0:35:00| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2100)|
| 0:35:01| Okay, so this we need a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2101)|
| 0:35:04| Councilman Dellivopy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Yeah, I see that Jim York is here and we'd love for him to come down and maybe tell the taxpayers what we're doing with $18.2 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2105)|
| 0:35:15| and how we're going to go about financing this wonderful project of fixing our lighting system with LEDs and saving money each year by doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2115)|
| 0:35:26| Go ahead, Jim. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2126)|
| 0:35:28| Jim York, Finance Director for the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2128)|
| 0:35:31| What you have here is actually what we would call a cash flow mechanism.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2131)|
| 0:35:38| What we are proposing to do is that we will take existing resources and basically fund the expenditures related to the LED streetlight project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2138)|
| 0:35:52| until we are formally ready to issue bonds for the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2152)|
| 0:36:00| By doing so, we avoid paying interest costs which would occur at the point of issuance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2160)|
| 0:36:08| And basically what we can do is we can cash flow it until we have large expenditures going forward from that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2168)|
| 0:36:17| And just by delaying that, we can save potentially up to $300,000 a year just by delaying the issuance until we actually need the money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2177)|
| 0:36:28| And so I'd be happy to answer any questions that you might have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2188)|
| 0:36:33| Jim, are you talking about 10-year bonds or whatever when you get to it or you haven't gotten that far yet in terms of the valuation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2193)|
| 0:36:38| These bonds would be no longer than 10 years because we can't borrow for more than the expected life of the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2198)|
| 0:36:46| I see. The LEDs are warranted for 10 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2206)|
| 0:36:51| They're warranted for 10 years. We obviously hope that they will last longer than that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2211)|
| 0:36:55| But, again, our practice is not to exceed the life.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2215)|
| 0:37:02| And I think you told me earlier, but just to repeat, you're not going to borrow more money than you need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2222)|
| 0:37:09| You're just going to evaluate as you go and borrow up to $18.2 million, but maybe less.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2229)|
| 0:37:14| Yes. My guess is that the final issue will be somewhere in the $15 million-plus range, probably in the low $15 million, after we finally get everything priced out accordingly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2234)|
| 0:37:28| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2248)|
| 0:37:29| Thank you. Councilman Stair?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2250)|
| 0:37:31| Given the size of this item and the moment for it, I just wanted to invite Aaron Gill down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2251)|
| 0:37:38| We talked about this recently at the budget, but just for the public and those watching, just to explain what we're doing, why we're doing it, what the public can expect, and a general timeline.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2258)|
| 0:37:49| Sure. Absolutely. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2269)|
| 0:37:50| Aaron Gill, Director of Sustainability for the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2270)|
| 0:37:53| So this resolution and the one before, as you mentioned, relate to the LED streetlight replacement project, which we are taking the first step toward tonight with the approval of the contract with Siemens for the design and installation of the lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2273)|
| 0:38:08| To sort of refresh your memory and for those who are hearing it for the first time, the city pays for and maintains 29,500 streetlights across city roadways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2288)|
| 0:38:20| KUB really takes care of that for us, but they bill us for the energy as well as the maintenance cost.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2300)|
| 0:38:26| By converting them to LED, we can not only cut the energy in half, 50%, which is going to have tremendous environmental benefits, but we can also significantly reduce the maintenance costs associated because, as Councilman Della Volpe alluded to, these lights do last significantly longer than the high-pressure sodium lights that we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2306)|
| 0:38:47| So they're warrantied for 10 years, but as you know, when you get a car warranty, you usually drive the car quite a bit longer, so we're hoping that the lights would actually potentially last closer to 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2327)|
| 0:38:55| They have a rated life of 100,000 hours.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2335)|
| 0:38:57| So they have a very long lifespan, very good energy savings, and so by moving forward with this project, what we're going to be able to do is transform the streetlight into a modern system and capture with that significant energy and maintenance cost savings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2337)|
| 0:39:13| So all told, we expect that this would pay back in quite a bit less time than the 10-year bond that would be associated with its financing, and we think that it'll have tremendous aesthetic benefits for the community, too, as the light quality is just an improvement over what we have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2353)|
| 0:39:27| And just a timeline for the implementation?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2367)|
| 0:39:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2370)|
| 0:39:31| So with the contract, we'll kick off approximately a four- to six-month design phase, which is really critical for us to get right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2371)|
| 0:39:36| We want to put the time in to make sure the design is really well thought out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2376)|
| 0:39:40| It'll start with an inventory, so Siemens will actually be going through each neighborhood, making sure we know exactly where the lights are, what's the wattage now, what the replacement light should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2380)|
| 0:39:50| They'll do a public demo, so we'll have several locations around the city that both we as city staff and council members but also our public can go and see what we're expecting to put in so we can try before we buy, so to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2390)|
| 0:40:03| That'll wrap up, I think, around the end of the year, the current schedule.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2403)|
| 0:40:07| So we would expect the installation of the new lights to begin either very late in the year 2017 or early 2018.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2407)|
| 0:40:14| We expect that process to take probably between 8 to 12 months before we would finish the whole streetlight retrofit across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2414)|
| 0:40:22| The term for the contract goes until June 2019 to give ourselves lots of buffer to make sure we're not going too fast, not going too slow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2422)|
| 0:40:29| We'll have it all cleared up by June 2019, but we expect that most of the lights will go in next calendar year, starting around January, would be my guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2429)|
| 0:40:37| Great. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2437)|
| 0:40:38| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2438)|
| 0:40:39| Any other?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2439)|
| 0:40:40| One other question, Mayor. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2440)|
| 0:40:43| If I remember your earlier presentation, you told us that these would also avoid some of that skylight pollution that, you know, the lighting is directed downward to the street where it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2443)|
| 0:40:55| Could you tell us about that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2455)|
| 0:40:56| Yeah, so the orange glow over Knoxville, preventing us from seeing the stars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2456)|
| 0:41:00| Yeah, so with the new LED lights is a directional light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2460)|
| 0:41:03| And so the light shines as opposed to the traditional bulb that we have now sort of all over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2463)|
| 0:41:09| The light will shine for an LED very directional toward the roadway where you want it to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2469)|
| 0:41:13| What that means is that you have less up light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2473)|
| 0:41:16| So we're expecting a significant improvement from at least the lights on city property with the roadways, a significant improvement, what we would call the dark sky impact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2476)|
| 0:41:24| So we'll have hopefully as a result, darker skies above Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2484)|
| 0:41:28| I would love to see a few more constellations for my backyard as a result.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2488)|
| 0:41:32| Of course, we're not addressing private lighting, but I think this will be a really good first start to starting to address that dark sky consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2492)|
| 0:41:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2500)|

| 0:41:43| Great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2503)|
| 0:41:44| I'm just curious.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2504)|
| 0:41:45| Is the city responsible for the interstate lighting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2505)|
| 0:41:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2508)|
| 0:41:49| So interstate lights are included in our contract with Siemens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2509)|
| 0:41:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2513)|

| 0:46:55| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2815)|
| 0:46:56| I'd like to make a motion that we hear this on an emergency basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2816)|
| 0:46:59| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2819)|
| 0:47:00| Okay, we have a motion and a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2820)|
| 0:47:03| So we'll vote first on this amendment, which is to make this emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2823)|
| 0:47:06| Councilman Dela Vopi?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2826)|
| 0:47:07| Yeah, I wonder if Councilman Grieve would tell us what the emergency is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2827)|
| 0:47:10| It's just the beginning of the new fiscal year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2830)|
| 0:47:12| What's the emergency?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2832)|
| 0:47:13| Vicki Hatfield is here, which I didn't know whether we wanted to go ahead and vote or| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2833)|
| 0:47:16| whether we want her to come forward to explain.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2836)|
| 0:47:19| Well, he wants to know what the reason is, so do you want to explain why emergency is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2839)|
| 0:47:24| what you're requesting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2844)|
| 0:47:25| Sure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| Vicki Hatfield, Civil Service Director for the City of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2846)|
| 0:47:29| Our regular July 1st class comp ordinance came before you guys in May.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2849)|
| 0:47:35| That was approved on second reading May 23rd.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2855)|
| 0:47:38| Some additional changes came up after that ordinance was on second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2858)|
| 0:47:43| Housekeeping to the original big change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2863)|
| 0:47:46| Some were brand new.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2866)|
| 0:47:48| Some reorganizations took place, and that created some new needs that we weren't aware of when I brought the previous ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2868)|
| 0:47:55| And in reviewing the changes that were new, I realized that a few things that should have been in that previous ordinance were also omitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2875)|
| 0:48:04| So because of those two things, I wanted to make this ordinance effective on the same date as our original changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2884)|
| 0:48:11| so that all the class comp changes are made on the same date, which is July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2891)|
| 0:48:16| So it's the new fiscal year, and you want them all in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2896)|
| 0:48:19| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2899)|
| 0:48:20| We'd just like everything to be official on the same date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2900)|
| 0:48:23| And it's also my understanding that normally this would take two readings, and so that's why we're asking for an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2903)|
| 0:48:28| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2908)|
| 0:48:31| Okay, thank you, Vicki.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2911)|
| 0:48:32| Okay, so we're voting on the amendment to make this an emergency, to have it passed as an emergency.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2912)|
| 0:48:41| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2921)|

| 0:48:43| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2923)|
| 0:48:44| That passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2924)|
| 0:48:45| Now we go back to the original motion as amended.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2925)|
| 0:48:48| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2928)|

| 0:48:51| The ayes have it, and so ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2931)|
| 0:48:55| Okay, that brings us to the end of our agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2935)|
| 0:48:58| We do have three people signed up for public forum, and they will be heard in this order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2938)|

| 0:49:30| I live at 811 Avis Lennon Street in Mechanicsville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2970)|
| 0:49:33| And I wanted to speak with you guys just a little bit about the upcoming short-term rental ordinance that you guys are going to be workshopping on next week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2973)|
| 0:49:43| Sort of give you guys a few thoughts going into that to think about while you're discussing that and learning more about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2983)|
| 0:49:50| I've been to all of the meetings regarding this, and from the beginning it sort of seemed that the policy was already sort of predetermined| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=2990)|
| 0:50:01| and the public input was more of a show, although I appreciate that happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3001)|
| 0:50:11| The main things that were discussed going into those meetings were legalizing an activity that's currently not technically legal, but it's happening anyways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3011)|
| 0:50:25| And this is a sensitive subject with some people with commercial activity going into neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3025)|
| 0:50:33| Another thing that was sort of thought about was the affordability issue for housing of Knoxville residents with short-term rentals displacing long-term rentals, which can be a valid concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3033)|
| 0:50:48| And another main sort of pillar of this policy was said to be the preservation of neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3048)|
| 0:50:56| All of these meetings took place in the 4th and Gill neighborhood, which I believe were probably some of the most active residents of this sort of input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3056)|
| 0:51:08| One of their neighborhood sort of association representatives at the MPC meeting had mentioned that they were afraid of people buying homes solely for the purpose of short-term rentals and not living in them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3068)|
| 0:51:23| And so I think that's probably one of a lot of people's concerns, and that's what I really have an issue with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3083)|
| 0:51:29| I don't think that the policy needs to be put in place to ban short-term rentals by non-owner occupants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3089)|
| 0:51:37| I think that we are going to sort of miss out on some of Knoxville's opportunity to potentially rehabilitate a lot of homes that are currently vacant if the market for some short-term rentals could be more viable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3097)|
| 0:51:53| Another thing is complaints about short-term rentals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3113)|
| 0:51:58| There really haven't been very many that we know of, and that was discussed at the MPC meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3118)|
| 0:52:05| But there's not a lot of good data to figure out if the complaint is on a short-term rental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3125)|
| 0:52:12| I think we're just jumping the gun on a larger policy when I think we could start smaller with just permitting short-term rentals so that we can study and know where they are, how many are there, how many continue every year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3132)|
| 0:52:30| And when we actually think there could be a problem with, say, affordability in housing, then we address the issue then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3150)|
| 0:52:37| Or when we see that there might be too many complaints for people who are non-owner occupied or owner occupied, we address it at that point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3157)|
| 0:52:46| But we really just don't have a good understanding of how many there are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3166)|
| 0:52:50| And I don't want to miss out on how Knoxville could grow if these could have an economic benefit in the long term.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3170)|
| 0:52:59| How do we want to have our city develop in the long run?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3179)|
| 0:53:03| Do we want to have neighborhoods that could have a few short-term rentals and could help sort of a small little micro-tourism in pockets of neighborhoods where smaller businesses can have more people eating at their restaurants, more entertainment in more local areas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3183)|
| 0:53:17| Then short-term rentals help benefit that kind of vision of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3197)|
| 0:53:22| Recently, there was the South Knoxville Bike Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3202)|
| 0:53:27| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| Some people had asked, where are people going to stay if they want to come to this bike park?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3209)|
| 0:53:33| And short-term rentals can help accommodate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3213)|
| 0:53:38| So the main thing is just not jumping the gun on too much policy that is sort of addressing issues that I don't think we have yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3218)|
| 0:53:48| So thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3228)|
| 0:53:50| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3230)|
| 0:53:51| And as you mentioned, the workshop is next week, and I hope you'll be there as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3231)|
| 0:53:56| Okay, next, Von Burris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| Mr. Burris, thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| Please state your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3241)|
| 0:54:03| Von Burris.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3243)|
| 0:54:04| I live at 3129 Pacific Street, 37917.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3244)|
| 0:54:10| Thank you for this opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3250)|
| 0:54:12| I apologize for the hat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3252)|
| 0:54:14| It's doctor ordered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3254)|
| 0:54:16| I have lesions on my head.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3256)|
| 0:54:18| Bright light makes them worse, whether it's sunlight or artificial light.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3258)|
| 0:54:24| So I apologize.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3264)|
| 0:54:26| I bought the property at 3129 Broadway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3266)|
| 0:54:31| Well, actually, I first purchased the equipment and rented the property in the early 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3271)|
| 0:54:39| It's actually 3129 Broadway, which we are refurbishing now, bringing it totally up to code for Miss Goodman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3279)|
| 0:54:53| And it's coming along nicely, and I think it will do much better after the work is completed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3293)|
| 0:55:05| But sometime during the early 80s, we had a major flood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3305)|
| 0:55:13| This was after I was in the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3313)|
| 0:55:17| And SBA moved really quickly for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3317)|
| 0:55:22| But that flood cost me $30,000, which I had to work out day by day and pay them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3322)|
| 0:55:32| And I did pay them in full.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| And at some point in time, the council turned over to KCDC the operation of clearing First Creek from my address there at the bridge on Broadway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3335)|
| 0:55:57| all the way down past the Broadway Shopping Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3357)|
| 0:56:03| I don't know how far they went past the Broadway Shopping Center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3363)|
| 0:56:07| But that has saved us so many times over these last few years due to climate change or whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3367)|
| 0:56:19| We've been having flooding lately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3379)|
| 0:56:22| Now, so far, it hasn't been in any of our homes because I also live on First Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3382)|
| 0:56:30| I live two buildings behind the 3129 Broadway property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3390)|
| 0:56:37| And if we don't get some help with cleaning the forestry, this is not going to be a hundred-year flood plan like KCDC had sold it to us to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3397)|
| 0:56:54| When they were getting easements and buying properties, et cetera, they told us that this would be the hundred-year flood plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3414)|
| 0:57:05| I was told by the representative that there would be a road built on Chickamauga from Chickamauga down to the creek| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3425)|
| 0:57:18| and that there would be an iron gate there and that there would, from time to time, be big rubber-tired loaders and tandem trucks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3438)|
| 0:57:31| that would be brought in to keep First Creek deep, wide, keep it big enough to carry the waters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3451)|
| 0:57:43| Well, there's never been the first truck in all these years since the work's been done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3463)|
| 0:57:51| There's never been the first loader that's come in and hauled out any garbage out of First Creek.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3471)|
| 0:57:58| And we're in a mess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3478)|
| 0:58:02| I mean, I guess I'll just have to take flood insurance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3482)|
| 0:58:07| That's the only other recourse that I know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3487)|
| 0:58:10| You have one minute, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3490)|
| 0:58:12| Unless you folks will help us by going back again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3492)|
| 0:58:18| This was years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3498)|
| 0:58:21| Go back again and clear-cut the banks and let the water flow to where our properties won't be flooded and we'll lose lots of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3501)|
| 0:58:38| I thank you for your time, and I'm speaking for the homeowners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3518)|
| 0:58:46| I'm the only one left alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3526)|
| 0:58:50| And they didn't give us pieces of paper that said, this is what we're going to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3530)|
| 0:58:57| You know, they didn't sign any paperwork.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| We were just all convinced that this was the miracle we were looking for.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3540)|
| 0:59:05| But, unfortunately, the man who did these deals no longer is with KCDC.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| He's retired.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3551)|
| 0:59:13| But I think he's still alive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3553)|
| 0:59:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3554)|
| 0:59:15| So, Mr. Burrs, would you, Jim Hagerman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3555)|
| 0:59:18| Jim Hagerman, would you show him who you are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| Mr. Burrs, would you maybe, we've got one more person to hear from, but if you would get with Mr. Hagerman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3561)|
| 0:59:28| and he's the Director of Engineering, and he can follow up with you and look into it and try to address your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3568)|
| 0:59:34| Well, thank you very much, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3574)|
| 0:59:35| Thank you so much for coming.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3575)|
| 0:59:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3576)|
| 0:59:37| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3577)|
| 0:59:38| Thank you for your time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3578)|
| 0:59:39| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3579)|
| 0:59:40| And now, Vivian Scheip.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| Thank you for being here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3583)|
| 0:59:50| Set your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3590)|
| 0:59:55| Vivian Scheip, 109 South Gallaher View Road, Knoxville, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3595)|
| 1:00:01| During the last torrential rainfall, I was heading east on Magnolia when I saw an elderly lady with no legs in a wheelchair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3601)|
| 1:00:11| She was waiting for a bus.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3611)|
| 1:00:14| She was struggling to stay dry to no avail, and she looked to be in her late 70s or 80s.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3614)|
| 1:00:21| It seemed to me strange that there was no bus shelter at a bus stop near a facility that houses the elderly and the disabled.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3621)|
| 1:00:31| I decided to do a little research, and I drove the full length of Magnolia and the full length of Martin Luther King Boulevard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3631)|
| 1:00:40| I found there are absolutely no shelters on either street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3640)|
| 1:00:46| I called CAT and was told that they're under the city jurisdiction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3646)|
| 1:00:51| I'm here today to ask you to install those type of shelters, the kind that you can roll into not only along MLK and Magnolia, but near any facility that houses the elderly and the disabled and any other vulnerable individual.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3651)|
| 1:01:11| As it's transit week, when you begin to ride all over the city, look around and notice this type of lack of shelters in all parts of the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3671)|
| 1:01:21| These people already face obstacles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3681)|
| 1:01:24| Getting around is hard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3684)|
| 1:01:27| Being rained on and snowed on should not be an obstacle they have to endure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3687)|
| 1:01:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3692)|
| 1:01:33| Thank you, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3693)|
| 1:01:36| Okay, council, that is the end of public forum, so there's no further business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3696)|
| 1:01:41| We are adjourned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/CityCouncil170620?start=3701)|
