| 0:00:57| I've got an extra one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=57)|
| 0:00:58| I'm going to start off with the Pledge of Allegiance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=58)|
| 0:00:59| And, Commissioner Ballard, would you lead us in the Pledge, please?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=59)|

| 0:01:28| The next item is approval of amendments that have been sent to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=88)|
| 0:01:30| Do I hear a motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=90)|
| 0:01:31| So be it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=91)|
| 0:01:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=92)|
| 0:01:33| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=93)|
| 0:01:34| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=94)|
| 0:01:35| Any discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=95)|
| 0:01:36| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=96)|
| 0:01:37| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=97)|
| 0:01:38| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=98)|
| 0:01:39| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=99)|
| 0:01:44| Amendments to the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=104)|
| 0:01:50| Applying J. Plaza.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=110)|
| 0:01:53| Add that to the minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=113)|
| 0:01:55| Mr. Minor, are they prepared for that one today still?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=115)|
| 0:01:59| I have no knowledge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=119)|
| 0:02:02| You have no knowledge?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=122)|
| 0:02:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=124)|
| 0:02:06| I don't think they're here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=126)|
| 0:02:07| I haven't heard anything from them either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=127)|
| 0:02:08| And I know you told me you had contacted them last week and haven't heard anything from them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=128)|
| 0:02:12| I called him last week, and he told me he still wasn't ready for me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=132)|
| 0:02:16| I haven't heard since then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=136)|
| 0:02:17| That makes it easy for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=137)|
| 0:02:18| We will not do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=138)|
| 0:02:19| Mr. Law Director, if you want to go ahead, we're in our individuals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=139)|
| 0:02:23| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=143)|
| 0:02:24| If you want to testify today, please stand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=144)|
| 0:02:27| Raise your right hand to be sworn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=147)|
| 0:02:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=151)|
| 0:02:32| Do each of you, through your testimony here today, agree to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=152)|
| 0:02:38| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=158)|
| 0:02:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=159)|
| 0:02:45| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=165)|
| 0:02:47| First item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=167)|
| 0:02:48| Clerk, read that to our record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=168)|
| 0:02:49| Thomas Joseph Pitner, MTMs, 7712 Clinton Highway for on-premises, formerly Raymond's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=169)|
| 0:02:59| Hi, Mr. Pitner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=179)|
| 0:03:00| How are you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=180)|
| 0:03:02| I'm doing fine, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=182)|
| 0:03:04| I wanted this to come back before the body for further discussion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=184)|
| 0:03:14| As a result of the last meeting, Mr. Pitner has provided me with a copy of their lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=194)|
| 0:03:23| and I believe his beer permit was granted contingent upon my review of the lease arrangement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=203)|
| 0:03:33| and perhaps the sheriff's department, maybe the health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=213)|
| 0:03:39| That was the report I think that was going to be due.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=219)|
| 0:03:46| The property, there is a commercial lease between a person by the name of H.P. Oxendine with Matt Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=226)|
| 0:03:59| Mr. Taylor, Mr. Taylor is here, and we talked about that at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=239)|
| 0:04:07| As you recall, Mr. Pitner said that he was the person who was leasing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=247)|
| 0:04:14| What I have as a result of that last meeting, not only is the commercial lease,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=254)|
| 0:04:20| but I have a one-page document, it's handwritten, and it says this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=260)|
| 0:04:29| I, and then there's a blank with the name scribbled in, H.P. Oxendine, give permission to Matt Taylor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=269)|
| 0:04:36| to sublease property at 7712 Clinton Highway to Thomas J. Pitner exclusively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=276)|
| 0:04:43| Any lease between Matt Taylor and Thomas Pitner is not capable of overriding the lease between Matt Taylor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=283)|
| 0:04:51| and H.P. Oxendine, and it's signed by H.P. Oxendine and Thomas Pitner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=291)|
| 0:05:06| And it looks like there was a signature line for Matt Taylor, but I don't believe he finished signing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=306)|
| 0:05:20| There's just the word Matt written in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=320)|
| 0:05:24| That's how I sign it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=324)|
| 0:05:25| I just write Matt.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=325)|
| 0:05:34| Well, you signed the original lease, Matt Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=334)|
| 0:05:41| This is an undated document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=341)|
| 0:05:43| It is one that's not notarized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=343)|
| 0:05:50| So, therefore, we're not certain sitting here as a body today whether H.P. Oxendine, Jr. actually signed it or not,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=350)|
| 0:05:57| because there's no notary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=357)|
| 0:05:59| Is Mr. Oxendine here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=359)|
| 0:06:01| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=361)|
| 0:06:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=362)|
| 0:06:14| That's pretty much it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=374)|
| 0:06:17| I just had some strong reservations about the arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=377)|
| 0:06:24| It looks like the lease that was signed by Mr. Taylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=384)|
| 0:06:29| that was signed back in January of 2008.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=389)|
| 0:06:35| At that time, I believe they were looking into operating this establishment as a new dancing facility.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=395)|
| 0:06:47| They then decided to change that to more or less just a bar, as I understand it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=407)|
| 0:06:58| I'm just not sure that I have a lot of faith in the document that is handwritten that is provided to me| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=418)|
| 0:07:08| as a sublease of this property to Mr. Pitner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=428)|
| 0:07:14| Because I believe it was also expressed at the last meeting that Mr. Taylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=434)|
| 0:07:22| you were going to work at this location, too, were you not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=442)|
| 0:07:26| I was just working.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=446)|
| 0:07:27| I was working for Mr. Pitner, but we didn't have a beer license at the time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=447)|
| 0:07:34| So I didn't think it applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=454)|
| 0:07:36| But basically, he was going to sign a lease with me contingent that he got his beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=456)|
| 0:07:40| So that's why me and him haven't signed a lease yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=460)|
| 0:07:42| I thought that was pretty standard that you wait until you have all your licenses in order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=462)|
| 0:07:46| then you rent the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=466)|
| 0:07:51| And with that lease and document that you have there, I've been able to get my KUB cut on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=471)|
| 0:07:57| my utilities and everything, providing that, and they've all accepted it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=477)|
| 0:08:02| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=482)|
| 0:08:05| I think we're looking at something that's a bit more serious than just turning on your water and your lights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=485)|
| 0:08:14| And it's a matter of whether you actually do have a valid legal document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=494)|
| 0:08:21| You actually have validly leased the property from Mr. Oxendine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=501)|
| 0:08:25| Personally, I would not and I would advise the board not to accept this document| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=505)|
| 0:08:33| without it being properly notarized and witnessed by Mr. Oxendine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=513)|
| 0:08:43| I believe that Mr. Oxendine's health will let him that he'll have no problem going to a notary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=523)|
| 0:08:51| and getting it notarized if that's what we have to do to go on with the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=531)|
| 0:08:57| If you can provide me with a notarized document, one that I can live with from a legal standpoint,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=537)|
| 0:09:11| I would be much more comfortable than what I have now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=551)|
| 0:09:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=555)|
| 0:09:16| I mean, what I see, and I'm not going to make assumptions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=556)|
| 0:09:19| but I can certainly make a lot of assumptions based upon the history,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=559)|
| 0:09:23| based upon the short history of this whole transaction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=563)|
| 0:09:26| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=566)|
| 0:09:28| So I need myself to see more proof, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=568)|
| 0:09:31| from a legal aspect of who it is that is really leasing this property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=571)|
| 0:09:39| And it makes a big difference.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=579)|
| 0:09:41| Mr. Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=581)|
| 0:09:42| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=582)|
| 0:09:43| Well, I think just a little something about contracts but not being an attorney.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=583)|
| 0:09:47| You really need it dated and notarized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=587)|
| 0:09:51| Protect yourself in case there's some dispute with him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=591)|
| 0:09:56| He mentioned his health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=596)|
| 0:09:57| So were his heirs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=597)|
| 0:09:59| And I think it is wise to protect yourself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=599)|
| 0:10:02| And with the recommendation of the law director, I'd just be much more comfortable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=602)|
| 0:10:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=607)|
| 0:10:08| And protect yourself as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=608)|
| 0:10:10| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=610)|
| 0:10:11| But a good word in a handshake doesn't go far nowadays.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=611)|
| 0:10:15| And that's basically what I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=615)|
| 0:10:16| And I understand where you're coming from on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=616)|
| 0:10:20| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=620)|
| 0:10:21| We can't really grant beer permits on handshakes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=621)|
| 0:10:24| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=624)|
| 0:10:25| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=625)|
| 0:10:26| I just had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=626)|
| 0:10:27| This is probably for the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=627)|
| 0:10:30| Mr. Taylor had stated before that he has a criminal record and that now does this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=630)|
| 0:10:36| since Mr. Pitner is leasing, is subleasing from Mr. Taylor,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=636)|
| 0:10:41| does his criminal record have come into play into that at all?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=641)|
| 0:10:45| And or does that kind of lend credence to where they were, the other couple that had come| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=645)|
| 0:10:50| and testified before us that they were operating as a group, the business was?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=650)|
| 0:10:56| Well, we did have the other testimony, which caused us some concern, which is one of the reasons that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=656)|
| 0:11:04| I look at this and I see an undated document, one that's not notarized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=664)|
| 0:11:09| It makes that testimony certainly, I give it more credibility than I might not have otherwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=669)|
| 0:11:18| You know, as far as the beer permitting goes, if you have been convicted of a felony| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=678)|
| 0:11:26| involving moral turpitude within the past 10 years, then you could not apply for a beer permit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=686)|
| 0:11:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=696)|
| 0:11:38| Mr. Taylor does have a criminal history with crimes involving moral turpitude, but they were over 10 years ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=698)|
| 0:11:50| So they are beyond the statute requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=710)|
| 0:11:55| So it would be acceptable for him certainly to lease the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=715)|
| 0:12:02| I just don't have a whole lot of confidence in this whole arrangement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=722)|
| 0:12:07| Commissioner DeVries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=727)|
| 0:12:08| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=728)|
| 0:12:11| With a little bit of investigating, I looked into some of these applicants,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=731)|
| 0:12:17| and some of them don't have a permit from codes to occupy the premises.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=737)|
| 0:12:23| And I was wanting to know, does that ever come into play with our decisions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=743)|
| 0:12:28| We get the reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=748)|
| 0:12:30| We have reports, and it's part of our beer rules and regs that we receive the reports| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=750)|
| 0:12:37| and they need to be favorable reports before they are granted a beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=757)|
| 0:12:42| I know we had one outstanding report or so on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=762)|
| 0:12:47| I just don't remember which one it was, whether it was fire marshal or who it was or health department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=767)|
| 0:12:53| Do you all know?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=773)|
| 0:12:55| It's in compliance with the County Fire Prevention Bureau.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=775)|
| 0:13:01| I'm sorry?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=781)|
| 0:13:04| Also zoning is okay on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=784)|
| 0:13:06| So as far as we're concerned, it's okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=786)|
| 0:13:08| And the sheriff was okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=788)|
| 0:13:12| I know Wolfie was at the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=792)|
| 0:13:16| I think Wolfie has a lot to address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=796)|
| 0:13:19| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=799)|
| 0:13:20| Wolfie, why don't you come to the mic?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=800)|
| 0:13:26| If you remember when we were doing the hearing last time, Mr. Taylor was saying that he had nothing to do with the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=806)|
| 0:13:39| building, the running of it, or any of the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=819)|
| 0:13:42| Yes, he did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=822)|
| 0:13:44| I also found out that he did have a lease in his name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=824)|
| 0:13:50| And that's my only concern right there was that he does have a conviction, a federal conviction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=830)|
| 0:14:00| that would, I believe, cause him not to be able to be involved in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=840)|
| 0:14:07| Mr. Lauderdale, I don't think that you're too comfortable with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=847)|
| 0:14:10| His conviction is over 10 years old.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=850)|
| 0:14:14| But I did recall that testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=854)|
| 0:14:18| And we've gone back and I actually have a copy of the CD from the last meeting because I did have concerns about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=858)|
| 0:14:36| Mr. Taylor testified last time that in 1997 he and a college buddy counterfeited money with a computer,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=876)|
| 0:14:46| that he was just going to be an employee of the bar.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=886)|
| 0:14:52| Mr. Taylor testified that he had never taken a warrant out for the TV.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=892)|
| 0:14:58| And this is in response to some of the other testimony.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=898)|
| 0:15:01| He expressed he's okay if he has to be fired for the beer license to issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=901)|
| 0:15:08| So, you know, we have that testimony from the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=908)|
| 0:15:16| In order to make all that right, I mean, first of all, if to make it right,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=916)|
| 0:15:25| I need to see a sublease that in my mind is valid, that would be legally valid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=925)|
| 0:15:32| Between myself and Mr. Taylor?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=932)|
| 0:15:34| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=934)|
| 0:15:35| And basically, I think we've got some trust issues that have arisen as a result of the last meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=935)|
| 0:15:43| And I don't know that I fully trust the testimony that we received from the mic from you or Mr. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=943)|
| 0:15:51| So I need to see more proof of your arrangement for Mr. Taylor basically to stand up and say he's really not involved with the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=951)|
| 0:16:06| And he really is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=966)|
| 0:16:07| I mean, you all didn't tell us last time that you were subleasing the building from Mr. Taylor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=967)|
| 0:16:13| Well, as far as MTMs goes, I'm MTMs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=973)|
| 0:16:19| Mr. Taylor, he let me know about this lease coming up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=979)|
| 0:16:24| I live in Sevier County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=984)|
| 0:16:25| I said, if you can make it happen, make it happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=985)|
| 0:16:28| And that's why we've got what we've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=988)|
| 0:16:31| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=991)|
| 0:16:33| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=993)|
| 0:16:34| Are they selling beer there now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=994)|
| 0:16:36| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=996)|
| 0:16:37| So they're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=997)|
| 0:16:38| I don't know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=998)|
| 0:16:39| They're not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=999)|
| 0:16:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1000)|
| 0:16:41| So you're not selling beer right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1001)|
| 0:16:43| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1003)|
| 0:16:45| So basically, would a motion be proper to defer this for 30 days pending the opportunity to clear up these legal matters?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1005)|
| 0:16:54| I believe it would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1014)|
| 0:16:55| I'll make a motion that we defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1015)|
| 0:16:57| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1017)|
| 0:16:58| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1018)|
| 0:16:59| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1019)|
| 0:17:00| All in favor, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1020)|
| 0:17:01| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1021)|
| 0:17:02| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1022)|

| 0:17:32| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1052)|
| 0:17:34| I'll take the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1054)|
| 0:17:41| Give me just a second, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1061)|
| 0:17:59| Sir, are you the applicant for the super, is it Mandarin?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1079)|

| 0:18:04| Are you the applicant?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1084)|
| 0:18:05| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1085)|
| 0:18:08| And what is your name again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1088)|
| 0:18:09| Bing Chen Zhou.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1089)|
| 0:18:15| And what is your address, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1095)|
| 0:18:18| The home address?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1098)|
| 0:18:21| Your business address, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1101)|
| 0:18:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1102)|
| 0:18:23| 7212 Manorville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1103)|
| 0:18:32| That doesn't add up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1112)|
| 0:18:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1127)|
| 0:18:48| We've got a different address than what he has on here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1128)|
| 0:18:56| I'm looking at this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1136)|
| 0:18:59| Yeah, I'm looking at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1139)|
| 0:19:30| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1170)|
| 0:19:33| All right, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1173)|
| 0:19:34| I was just, there's a little bit of confusion about what your address is here at this address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1174)|
| 0:19:38| What you have on your application is 7100 Manorville Pike.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1178)|
| 0:19:43| And you've sent a letter in to us, Ming Zhu, the president?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1183)|
| 0:19:50| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1190)|
| 0:19:51| Sent a letter in, and your address is 7212.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1191)|
| 0:19:56| And that's before I sent 7100 Manorville Highway, that beside the farm building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1196)|
| 0:20:06| the insurance, I bought from the farm, the Mandarin Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1206)|
| 0:20:12| It's near the town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1212)|
| 0:20:14| And we have been there about two years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1214)|
| 0:20:16| I moved the central building, 7212 Manorville Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1216)|
| 0:20:24| So you want your business address to be changed to 7212 on your application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1224)|
| 0:20:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1229)|
| 0:20:30| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1230)|
| 0:20:33| You also want to change the name from Super Mandarin on your application to Super Mandarin Restaurant, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1233)|
| 0:20:41| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1241)|
| 0:20:43| No, it's still the Super Mandarin, the corporations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1243)|
| 0:20:47| But we changed it to Tokyo Mandarin now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1247)|
| 0:20:51| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1251)|
| 0:20:52| We received a letter, March the 11th, from Ming Zhu, the president.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1252)|
| 0:21:00| And it appears that he is asking for your restaurant to be named the Super Mandarin Restaurant, Inc.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1260)|
| 0:21:10| The Inc. is before the Mandarin Inn.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1270)|
| 0:21:12| We bought here, we changed the Super Mandarin that with our corporations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| Okay, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1278)|
| 0:21:20| Did anyone understand?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1280)|
| 0:21:22| Corporations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1282)|
| 0:21:23| Corporations?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1283)|
| 0:21:24| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1284)|
| 0:21:24| Incorporated?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1284)|
| 0:21:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1285)|
| 0:21:26| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1286)|
| 0:21:28| See, that's not anywhere on the application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1288)|

| 0:30:35| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1835)|

| 0:30:44| Why are you here then?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1844)|
| 0:30:46| The business Emma's at Choteau Marina was in existence for a couple of years, went out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1846)|
| 0:30:53| When they became Choteau's Steak and Seafood, they also went out of business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1853)|
| 0:30:58| So I'm just going into leasing the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1858)|
| 0:31:02| Therefore, no relationship to Gina's.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1862)|
| 0:31:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1864)|

| 0:31:32| And let's start with have you or any of your employees been convicted of any violation of the laws against possession,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1892)|

| 0:32:28| So you rent the property from Mitch Jones, J&M Properties?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=1948)|

| 0:34:01| I guess what I'm requesting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2041)|
| 0:34:02| there's been an issue with the fire department, the location of a fire hydrant issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2042)|

| 0:34:13| What I'm requesting is to grant the beer license pending a successful fire inspection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2053)|
| 0:34:19| and health department inspection.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2059)|

| 0:34:26| If I miss that opportunity, the business probably won't open.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2066)|
| 0:34:30| I'll make a motion that we grant this approval pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2070)|

| 0:45:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2717)|
| 0:45:23| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2723)|
| 0:45:24| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2724)|
| 0:45:25| This location used to have an Eagles Club, which was a private club.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2725)|
| 0:45:29| It served beer there, but I don't think they ever --.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2729)|
| 0:45:34| Private clubs don't have to have a license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2734)|
| 0:45:36| Is that correct, UK?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2736)|
| 0:45:37| They do have a license, and it was at 2100 Emory Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2737)|
| 0:45:42| Same location?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2742)|
| 0:45:43| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2743)|
| 0:45:44| It's the same building?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2744)|
| 0:45:46| It might be the same building, but we issue a license at the address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2746)|
| 0:45:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2752)|
| 0:45:54| We may be talking about the same thing here, though.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2754)|
| 0:45:56| This is your address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2756)|
| 0:45:57| Is it 7545 Brickyard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2757)|
| 0:46:00| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2760)|
| 0:46:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2761)|
| 0:46:02| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2762)|
| 0:46:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2764)|
| 0:46:05| Mr. Roundtree?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2765)|
| 0:46:09| UK, I'm very familiar with that area there, and I know where this business is located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2769)|
| 0:46:14| Aren't there some apartment facilities next door to the business?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2774)|
| 0:46:23| Yes, sir, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2783)|
| 0:46:25| There's six apartments within 10 foot, and there's two apartments right overhead of the business.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2785)|
| 0:46:36| How far is this business, would you estimate, from the Powell High School sports complex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2796)|
| 0:46:43| Well, that's why we've got a coach.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2803)|
| 0:46:46| You might have asked her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2806)|
| 0:46:48| Ma'am?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2808)|
| 0:46:51| Hunter, I can't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2811)|
| 0:46:53| 100 feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2813)|
| 0:46:55| I'm not sure of the exact measurements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2815)|
| 0:46:57| It may be a little bit more than 100.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2817)|
| 0:46:59| To the residential or ag zone, it's like 85 feet, give or take.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2819)|
| 0:47:03| It's just on a computer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2823)|
| 0:47:05| UK, what's the rules on this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2825)|
| 0:47:09| Commissioner, our bear law says you've got to be 500 foot from residential or agricultural.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2829)|
| 0:47:18| And where they're living upstairs, you all would have to make a decision on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2838)|
| 0:47:24| We've had one place of business on Andrew Johnson Highway that they wouldn't let the lady get a beer license,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2844)|
| 0:47:35| so she signed a paper she wouldn't rent to upstairs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2855)|
| 0:47:39| And we go right up on Rutledge Park and issue a beer license for a six apartments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2859)|
| 0:47:47| So, it's up to you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2867)|
| 0:47:49| Well, you're talking about whether they have a variance or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2869)|
| 0:47:52| and whether they come before the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2872)|
| 0:47:56| Codes, have you all looked at this one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2876)|
| 0:47:59| And is it pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2879)|
| 0:48:01| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| What's pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2882)|
| 0:48:04| Codes review of this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2884)|
| 0:48:09| It sounds like, ma'am, if this is within 500 feet of a residential zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2889)|
| 0:48:17| then it sounds like before codes approves of your application, before you are granted a beer license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2897)|
| 0:48:26| If you're granted a beer license, it would be subject to codes approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2906)|
| 0:48:30| Before you are approved, you would need to get a variance from the Board of Zoning Appeals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2910)|
| 0:48:35| from our 500-foot set rule to however many feet it would be for you to operate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2915)|
| 0:48:44| I spoke to someone named Jeff and gave him all the information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2924)|
| 0:48:49| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| I couldn't hear you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2930)|
| 0:48:54| We have a plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2934)|
| 0:48:57| Hang on just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2937)|
| 0:49:00| Okay, Kim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| I was just explaining that I spoke to Jeff at the restaurant and faxed him all the materials| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2942)|
| 0:49:06| so they could apply for next month's BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2946)|
| 0:49:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2949)|
| 0:49:10| So you all have applied for a variance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2950)|
| 0:49:12| Yes, today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2952)|
| 0:49:13| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2953)|
| 0:49:14| This would be subject to the granting of a variance, as well as the other reports.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2954)|
| 0:49:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2963)|
| 0:49:25| I'll make a motion to approve pending codes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2965)|
| 0:49:29| Is there a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2969)|
| 0:49:32| Pending codes, fire marshal, health department, as well as being granted a variance by BZA.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2972)|
| 0:49:38| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2978)|
| 0:49:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2979)|
| 0:49:40| I have a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2980)|
| 0:49:41| Before we vote on this, I want to sort of brought some of this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2981)|
| 0:49:46| Guys, I'm not picking on you guys at all, but every single one of these, the fire marshals,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2986)|
| 0:49:50| it says pending, pending, pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2990)|
| 0:49:53| Can we not be?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| I sort of don't feel comfortable approving these when everything is pending, pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2995)|
| 0:49:58| You guys know what's come before us, and, I mean, we've got, you've done five in a row,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=2998)|
| 0:50:04| and every one of them is pending.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3004)|
| 0:50:07| And you don't tell us, I mean, there may be a very good reason, but what's pending?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3007)|
| 0:50:11| I don't know what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3011)|
| 0:50:13| I'd be more than happy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3013)|
| 0:50:14| We've just been told we either answer pending or okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3014)|
| 0:50:18| But I'd be more than happy to tell you where we're at on any of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3018)|
| 0:50:21| Well, you know, this is the final stage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3021)|
| 0:50:24| You know, I personally want to hear up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3024)|
| 0:50:27| You know, from it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3027)|
| 0:50:29| Well, pending is down for us until they get it approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3029)|
| 0:50:33| Until they've completed our process, pending is down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3033)|
| 0:50:37| I don't know if you guys are getting your paperwork in enough time to, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3037)|
| 0:50:41| I don't want to give you enough time to come up and make your decision out in the field what you need to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3041)|
| 0:50:46| but when we all come together, when they come to the podium, and you come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3046)|
| 0:50:51| and we come to the podium, we all need to be on the same page and have everything approved, ready to go.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3051)|
| 0:50:56| Mr. Chairman, I'd like to make a substitute motion that we defer this for 30 days| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3056)|
| 0:51:01| and give our people time to report back to us what the issues are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3061)|
| 0:51:07| I'd like to second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3067)|
| 0:51:10| All in favor of that motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3070)|
| 0:51:11| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3071)|
| 0:51:13| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3073)|
| 0:51:14| Did you want discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3074)|
| 0:51:16| Discussion with what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3076)|
| 0:51:19| Any other discussion on that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3079)|
| 0:51:21| I'd like to have some here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3081)|
| 0:51:23| Mr. Ballard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3083)|
| 0:51:24| There's no need to bring it back forward until you go through the Board of Zoning Appeals.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3084)|
| 0:51:28| And we didn't do it for any of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3088)|
| 0:51:30| There's no sense to put it back on the agenda in 30 days until, if they don't get their variance,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3090)|
| 0:51:34| then they're not going to get their license.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3094)|
| 0:51:37| So why put it back on the calendar before it goes through that process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3097)|
| 0:51:41| And, like you said, we've had five others and we didn't do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3101)|
| 0:51:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3105)|
| 0:51:46| We've had hundreds of others.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3106)|
| 0:51:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3108)|
| 0:51:49| You know, guys, if you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3109)|
| 0:51:52| So where does that leave us, Mr. Chairman?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3112)|
| 0:51:55| We have a motion on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3115)|
| 0:51:56| Oh, I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3116)|
| 0:51:57| Any other discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3117)|
| 0:51:59| We're voting on what again?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3119)|
| 0:52:00| The substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3120)|
| 0:52:01| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3121)|
| 0:52:02| If you want to repeat, repeat.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3122)|
| 0:52:05| To defer for 30 days.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3125)|
| 0:52:07| All in favor of the substitute motion, say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3129)|
| 0:52:10| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3130)|
| 0:52:11| Lock, sign.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3131)|
| 0:52:12| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3132)|
| 0:52:13| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3133)|
| 0:52:14| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3134)|
| 0:52:16| Two noes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3136)|
| 0:52:18| Rickland and Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3138)|
| 0:52:21| Rickland and Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3141)|
| 0:52:25| But, again, to our field personnel, you know, I know what to do what you can.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3145)|
| 0:52:32| Marlene, we'll get back with you next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3152)|
| 0:52:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3154)|
| 0:52:35| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3155)|

| 0:52:54| Are you Ms. Morton?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3174)|

| 0:53:06| sale, manufacture, or transportation of intoxicating liquor or of any crime involving moral turpitude within the past 10 years?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3186)|

| 0:53:20| So there's no outstanding license, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3200)|
| 0:53:22| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3202)|
| 0:53:23| This is for on-premise consumption, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3203)|
| 0:53:26| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3206)|

| 0:53:31| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3211)|
| 0:53:33| So you're going to lease the premises from John Bates?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3213)|

| 0:53:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3232)|

| 0:54:06| Fire Marshal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3246)|

| 0:54:18| And just to explain, sometimes our applications overlap.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3258)|
| 0:54:22| So when we get our applications and tell them to apply, the deadline for that meeting has already gone by.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3262)|
| 0:54:28| So they do have to apply for the next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3268)|
| 0:54:31| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3271)|

| 0:54:39| and the people who rent the house that's close by if that will help.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3279)|
| 0:54:44| Well, it may help BZA if you're going to have to get a variance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3284)|

| 0:54:50| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3290)|
| 0:54:51| You'll want to bring that to the Board of Zoning Appeals meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3291)|

| 0:55:00| I talked to the lady next door.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3300)|
| 0:55:03| Her husband, I believe, signed that paper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3303)|
| 0:55:06| But the lady don't want beer there, so it don't meet her 500-foot setback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3306)|
| 0:55:12| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3312)|
| 0:55:17| Any other reports you need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3317)|

| 0:55:25| I want to be consistent with what we just did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3325)|
| 0:55:27| And if she's got to go before the Board of Zoning Appeals, is that correct, that we postpone it to be consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3327)|
| 0:55:34| with what we did last time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3334)|

| 0:55:54| Clerk, on your item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3354)|
| 0:55:58| I don't see anything.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3358)|
| 0:55:59| Anything else come before the beer board at this time?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3359)|
| 0:56:02| Do I hear a motion to adjourn, Mr. Ballard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3362)|

| 1:05:15| Thank you chairman. It's kind of unique and probably a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3915)|
| 1:05:21| little different that Elaine Davis and I both are in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| fourth district and we both attend the same church in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| same Sunday school. So we do sunshine that we let everyone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3928)|
| 1:05:32| know that we're in the same Sunday school class so we don't| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3932)|
| 1:05:35| talk. We do wave our hands at each other but that's about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3935)|
| 1:05:39| But both of us are really blessed to be able to be a part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3939)|
| 1:05:46| of a wonderful church known as Sevier Heights Baptist Church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3946)|
| 1:05:51| This afternoon I've asked our associate pastor of Bible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3951)|
| 1:05:57| fellowship Don Wilson to address us. Don has done a| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3957)|
| 1:06:04| phenomenal job at Sevier Heights and our focus on Sunday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3964)|
| 1:06:08| school class on small groups and I believe it's one of the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3968)|
| 1:06:11| reason the church has seen such significant growth and last| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3971)|
| 1:06:16| year he actually even wrote our quarterly Sunday school| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3976)|
| 1:06:20| material which was just unbelievable and we're just| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3980)|
| 1:06:25| thankful to have you here today Don. Thank you. Thank you ladies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3985)|
| 1:06:29| and gentlemen. On behalf of our church and myself I just want to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3989)|
| 1:06:35| perhaps bring a word of encouragement to you. Scripturally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3995)|
| 1:06:39| those of us who are involved in churches across the county have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=3999)|
| 1:06:41| some responsibilities to you. The Book of Romans Apostle Paul| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4001)|
| 1:06:45| says that we're to submit to your authority to honor you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4005)|
| 1:06:50| because you are according to Paul there you are ministers of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4010)|
| 1:06:55| the grace of God in our lives. It means that from his| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4015)|
| 1:06:59| perspective God's called you to do what you do to provide for| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4019)|
| 1:07:03| our protection and our peace. Paul also was writing to a young| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4023)|
| 1:07:07| pastor in a major metropolitan area and he gave him instruction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4027)|
| 1:07:13| on his relationship with those in civil authority and he writes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4033)|
| 1:07:16| in First Peter Chapter 2. First of all then I urge that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4036)|
| 1:07:23| entreaties and prayers petitions and thanksgivings be made on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4043)|
| 1:07:27| behalf of all men for kings and all who are in authority in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4047)|
| 1:07:33| order that we may live a tranquil and quiet life and all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4053)|
| 1:07:37| godliness and dignity. This is good and acceptable in the sight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| of God our Savior. On behalf of our church and I think most| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4062)|
| 1:07:46| churches across the county we make a commitment to you all to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4066)|
| 1:07:50| do what Paul told Timothy to pray pray pray pray for you. You| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4070)|
| 1:07:59| perhaps more than any other level of government have more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4079)|
| 1:08:03| direct impact on our daily lives than anybody else. And your| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4083)|
| 1:08:08| impact is that we would live peaceable safe lives. And so we| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4088)|
| 1:08:13| pray for your wisdom. We do it consistently hopefully weekly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4093)|
| 1:08:18| And if it would be OK with you I would like to do that right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4098)|
| 1:08:21| now. Father God we thank you for this group of people. For| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4101)|

| 1:08:44| everything they say. Protect them. Watch over them. Use them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4124)|
| 1:08:50| as your ministers of grace in our lives. In Jesus name. Amen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4130)|
| 1:09:06| I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4146)|
| 1:09:23| Do we have any amendments to the agenda or withdrawals. Mr. Chairman I'd like to withdraw 9-11. Page 26. There's no objections. I'd like to put a on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4163)|
| 1:09:53| the consent. Hold on hold on. Withdrawal 9-11. Mr. Chairman. I'd like to move items 101 to 107 which are honorary resolutions to the front of the agenda so we may take care of those first. If you would would you give us the page. Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4193)|
| 1:10:18| I can't believe it's page four and five. It was 104. It's 101 to 107. On pages four and five. Which are honorary resolutions. You want to remove all. I'd like them to be appear first on the agenda. Oh yeah they would definitely be close.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4218)|
| 1:10:48| What do you have? 104 I'll wait to 104. 104 through 107. Mr. Chairman I do have a question about what he just did. 103 is on consent and should not be because it only was approved six to two and to be on consent it must be passed unanimously but now we've removed it from the consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4248)|
| 1:11:17| Yeah it should not have been on consent because there were two against it. My apologies. All but the noted one by Commissioner Luthal. I mean we can hear that then but there may be some discussion at that time. That would be fine. Mr. Daniels. Chairman 102 on page four would like to move it to next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4277)|
| 1:11:39| We've had some issues in trying to get an actual count on World War Two veterans. What I'd like to ask the media since they're here today to make this something that they write about. We want we want to be able to honor every World War Two veteran and to do that we really need the public's help especially the media.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4299)|
| 1:12:02| Mr. Jones and I have been trying to come up with a list and it started out from the state at over 5,000 in Knox County and now they've reconfirmed that it's somewhere in the neighborhood of probably 400. So I'd like to move that till next month. We have no objection for deferring it. Commissioner Davis. Yes thank you Chair. I'd like to see if we could move resolution 084804.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4322)|
| 1:12:31| It's on page 23. It has to do with Old South High. If we could move that kind of towards the front of the agenda. We have some people here to speak to that and I think they'd rather speak to it this afternoon than later tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4351)|
| 1:12:52| But what number was that again? It's 804 sir. On page 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4372)|
| 1:13:16| Commissioner Pinkston. Thank you Mr. Chairman. I'd like to amend the agenda| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4396)|
| 1:13:22| to have the two committees meet at the same time but they still be separate committees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4402)|
| 1:13:28| And anything that fails on that be withdrawn from the original county commission agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4408)|
| 1:13:36| I talked to the law director about the consent part but he said those needed to be read into the record at the regular meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4416)|
| 1:13:44| You want to make that two separate?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4424)|
| 1:13:48| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4428)|
| 1:13:51| You're adding those resolutions? Yes sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4431)|
| 1:13:57| Can you assign us some numbers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4437)|
| 1:14:01| And for those to go into effect if they pass next month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4441)|
| 1:14:07| Commissioner DeFreeze. Yes thank you Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4447)|
| 1:14:15| We have no objections to. Will you second? Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4455)|
| 1:14:20| Could he just not add that to consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4460)|
| 1:14:24| Commissioner Pinkston. I think it might be a little discussion on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4464)|
| 1:14:30| I don't think the vote will be anyway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4470)|
| 1:14:37| Commissioner DeFreeze. Thank you. On page 30 I would like to go ahead and withdraw the ordinance number 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4477)|
| 1:14:45| What page was that? Page 30.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4485)|
| 1:14:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4489)|
| 1:14:53| And then if we could move item on page 28, 921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4493)|
| 1:14:57| There is somebody to speak about that so if we could move that further up in the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4497)|
| 1:15:03| Page 28, number 921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4503)|
| 1:15:15| What did you say you wanted to move it? Can we move it to the front so that way there is somebody in the audience who would like to speak to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4515)|
| 1:15:23| Move it right after consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4523)|
| 1:15:33| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4533)|
| 1:15:36| Commissioner, I'd like to put on the consent agenda 802 and 803 if we could move those on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4536)|
| 1:15:42| Page 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4542)|
| 1:15:44| I think that's already been worked out with the purchasing department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4544)|
| 1:15:51| 802 and 803, page 23.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4551)|
| 1:15:57| But we haven't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4557)|
| 1:15:58| I see there are two different votes on intergovernmental and finance, so I don't think it can go on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4558)|
| 1:16:05| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4565)|
| 1:16:07| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4567)|
| 1:16:08| One has an amendment and the other one had no recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4571)|
| 1:16:12| So the full body hasn't had a chance to vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4572)|
| 1:16:14| Can we take it up right now and then put it on consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4574)|
| 1:16:16| We'll take it up after 921.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4576)|
| 1:16:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4583)|
| 1:16:26| Dr. Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4586)|
| 1:16:28| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| It's on page 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4590)|
| 1:16:33| It's resolution 601.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4593)|
| 1:16:36| I was going to request that we move that one up also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4596)|
| 1:16:38| I understand we have some emergency personnel that may need to answer some questions and they probably need to get back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4598)|
| 1:16:46| It's on page what?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4606)|
| 1:16:48| Page 8, 601.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4608)|
| 1:16:54| Mr. Briggs, are you leaving that on consent or are you taking it off consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4614)|
| 1:16:59| I was going to take it off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4621)|
| 1:17:02| Because there's been some questions come up since last week that I was called about that commissioners may have here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4622)|
| 1:17:10| Move it right before, right before and after.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4630)|
| 1:17:15| Before all of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4635)|
| 1:17:17| I need to sign something.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4637)|
| 1:17:21| I need you to declare again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4641)|
| 1:17:26| No, after you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4646)|
| 1:17:34| Commissioner Smith, you have another one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4654)|
| 1:17:42| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4662)|
| 1:17:43| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4663)|
| 1:17:45| I've got a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4665)|
| 1:17:45| I believe that like resolution 501 on page 8.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4665)|
| 1:17:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4674)|
| 1:17:55| It's on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4675)|
| 1:17:56| Does that impact next year's budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4676)|
| 1:18:00| There's a couple of them on here talking about 08-09 budgets or 08-09 years and they're on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4680)|
| 1:18:06| We'll move them off consent and we'll talk about them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4686)|
| 1:18:10| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4690)|
| 1:18:11| If we could take 501, 602.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4691)|
| 1:18:29| And I guess, Mr. Troyer, do you have any do you see any on there that would deal with next year's budget| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4709)|
| 1:18:36| besides those right now?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4716)|
| 1:18:38| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4718)|
| 1:18:40| I want those removed off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4720)|
| 1:18:42| Yes, if we can remove them just a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4722)|
| 1:18:47| Mr. Chairman, Mark Harmon over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| Is 914 on consent or on regular agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| I need to know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4733)|
| 1:18:59| What page is that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4739)|
| 1:19:01| 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4741)|
| 1:19:02| Yes, it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4742)|
| 1:19:03| It's on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4743)|
| 1:19:04| Can I have that removed from consent, please, 914?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4744)|
| 1:19:12| Can I go ahead and remove 917?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4752)|
| 1:19:14| Can I remove 917?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4754)|
| 1:19:20| I've got one more, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4760)|
| 1:19:23| Hold on a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4763)|
| 1:19:32| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4772)|
| 1:19:34| I'd like to remove 917 from consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4774)|
| 1:19:56| Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4796)|
| 1:20:00| I would like to, and I need Mr. Law Director, on page three,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4800)|
| 1:20:09| I understand what we were handed out at Intergovernmental about being mandated to approve the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4809)|
| 1:20:16| school's consent agenda, but I would like to go on record as abstaining from a vote on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4816)|
| 1:20:22| So do we pull that from the consent agenda,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| or do I just go on record as saying that I would like to abstain from that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4825)|
| 1:20:30| Right now, it is to be added, and it would be added to consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4830)|
| 1:20:36| We read school consent separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4836)|
| 1:20:40| We don't read them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4840)|
| 1:20:43| It would be added to consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4843)|
| 1:20:46| I mean, you could.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4846)|
| 1:20:49| So you can't take it off consent unless the, you know, basically by court order,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4849)|
| 1:20:57| unless the mayor has opined that funds aren't available or that it doesn't meet the requirements of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4857)|
| 1:21:10| The mayor has signed off on the contract, which certifies that the funds are sufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4870)|
| 1:21:15| So it cannot be taken off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4875)|
| 1:21:18| You can voice your opposition to it, I guess, prior to the consent vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4878)|
| 1:21:24| But by the court's order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4884)|
| 1:21:27| I understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4887)|
| 1:21:28| So I'll be given the opportunity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| Right before the vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4891)|
| 1:21:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4892)|
| 1:21:33| We read educational consent items one at a time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4893)|
| 1:21:37| It's not like regular consent where we're all done at one mass vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4897)|
| 1:21:44| Commissioner Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4904)|
| 1:21:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4909)|
| 1:21:50| I'd like to also take off, if it's not on consent, 920.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4910)|
| 1:21:56| What page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4916)|
| 1:21:57| Bottom of page 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4917)|
| 1:22:02| Yes, off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4922)|
| 1:22:10| Good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4930)|
| 1:22:17| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4937)|
| 1:22:18| Wait.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4938)|
| 1:22:19| I'm still.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4939)|
| 1:22:20| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4940)|
| 1:22:21| And 922, I guess it's still to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4941)|
| 1:22:30| Page 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4950)|
| 1:22:31| You have to give us the page, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4951)|
| 1:22:32| Page 29, 922.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4952)|
| 1:22:39| What did you want done?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4959)|
| 1:22:41| It says to be added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4961)|
| 1:22:42| I just want to make sure it's added.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4962)|
| 1:22:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4964)|
| 1:22:48| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4968)|
| 1:22:49| Page 3, 209.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4969)|
| 1:22:51| We hear those individually.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4971)|
| 1:22:53| I'd like to have that taken off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4973)|
| 1:22:59| That cannot be taken off consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4979)|
| 1:23:02| But can we speak on the issue?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4982)|
| 1:23:06| Right when it comes up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4986)|
| 1:23:12| This is a board of education matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4992)|
| 1:23:15| which is by agreement of this body and the board of education in a lawsuit that was resolved in 2003| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=4995)|
| 1:23:27| that this matter would be placed on the consent agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5007)|
| 1:23:31| It could not be withdrawn from the consent unless the mayor were to basically speak to the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5011)|
| 1:23:42| and to tell you that sufficient funds were not available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5022)|
| 1:23:48| The mayor has signed off on the contract, which is evidence that there are sufficient funds available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5028)|
| 1:23:56| It meets the legal requirements of law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5036)|
| 1:23:59| Therefore, it cannot be taken off consent by this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5039)|
| 1:24:04| Percent to that court order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5044)|
| 1:24:07| On this particular item, number 209.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5047)|
| 1:24:09| The employment contract between the board of education and Superintendent McIntyre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5049)|
| 1:24:15| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5055)|
| 1:24:17| Mr. Chair.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5057)|
| 1:24:19| Anything on the educational consent we cannot deal with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5059)|
| 1:24:23| I mean, we have to approve it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5063)|
| 1:24:25| We have no other choice.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5065)|
| 1:24:28| Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5068)|
| 1:24:30| Mr. Chair, the law director provided us with a copy of that order for the intergovernmental committee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5070)|
| 1:24:37| He may not have done that for the finance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5077)|
| 1:24:39| So maybe we can move on if I could ask him if he could provide the balance of the commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5079)|
| 1:24:45| with that copy of that opinion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5085)|
| 1:24:48| Hopefully, everyone received a copy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5088)|
| 1:24:50| But if you didn't, we had copies available at the meeting, and we'll make them available again for everyone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5090)|
| 1:25:00| Commissioner Moore, do you have another one?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5100)|
| 1:25:02| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5102)|
| 1:25:03| I was trying to get back to the school education, I guess, consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5103)|
| 1:25:06| I guess the law director says the mayor signed off on it to sufficient funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5106)|
| 1:25:13| How do we know there's sufficient funds for the 08-09 year when we haven't even had a budget?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5113)|
| 1:25:19| You'll have to ask the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5119)|
| 1:25:27| Well, I guess we anticipate that there would be a budget for the superintendent that would allow that much money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5127)|
| 1:25:35| I don't know if it's passed yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5135)|
| 1:25:39| I guess that the current budget, which would be the minimum budget the school board would have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5139)|
| 1:25:46| I guess there's enough funds within that what 360,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5146)|
| 1:25:51| $370 million ought to cover his salary, I would think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5151)|
| 1:25:56| But they're requesting, I think, like additional $39 million.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5156)|
| 1:25:59| So it's part of the $39 million going to pay the superintendent's salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5159)|
| 1:26:03| I guess it's the school board will divide up their money how they wish to divide it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5163)|
| 1:26:10| It's the way it's going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| Commissioner Pinkston?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5172)|
| 1:26:14| John, did I say you did I understand you to say this had to meet legal muster?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5174)|
| 1:26:19| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5179)|
| 1:26:22| I'm going to ask you one more time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5182)|
| 1:26:24| Read Article 11, Section 17, tell me what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5184)|
| 1:26:29| Now, I know what the BEP says, but I'm talking about this Constitution of the State of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5189)|
| 1:26:35| And then go to Article 7, Section 4, and read that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5195)|
| 1:26:39| You might read that one first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5199)|
| 1:26:41| Or I've read them all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5201)|
| 1:26:42| Well, all right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5202)|
| 1:26:43| What does it say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5203)|
| 1:26:44| We've talked about all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5204)|
| 1:26:45| We have, and I haven't seen the law yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5205)|
| 1:26:48| I've been promised the law, but Article 7, Section 4,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5208)|
| 1:26:52| says that any office created by the state legislature is to be filled by the county commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5212)|
| 1:26:58| the county courts, what it says, are the people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5218)|
| 1:27:03| Unless otherwise directed another way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5223)|
| 1:27:06| When you go to Article 17, read it, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5226)|
| 1:27:10| You've got a blue book there, haven't you, or the Constitution?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| I didn't bring my pocket Constitution with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5234)|
| 1:27:16| Well, I realize the BEP, I'm not saying that we do not have to have an appointed superintendent,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5236)|
| 1:27:23| but what I am questioning is the power of the school board to appoint the superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5243)|
| 1:27:28| I understand your request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5248)|
| 1:27:29| And according to the Constitution, they do not have that power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5249)|
| 1:27:33| Well, not so says the Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5253)|
| 1:27:35| Well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5255)|
| 1:27:36| But I understand your request, and I passed out an opinion for everyone, I believe at last month's meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5256)|
| 1:27:41| which addressed this very issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5261)|
| 1:27:44| While I may agree with you that I would prefer to have an elected superintendent, that is not the law in the state of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5264)|
| 1:27:52| I am not saying that we have to have an elected superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5272)|
| 1:27:57| What I'm saying is the Constitution states that it is our power, not the school board's power,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5277)|
| 1:28:03| to appoint this superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5283)|
| 1:28:06| Now, that's what the Constitution says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5286)|
| 1:28:07| If you'll read Article 7, Section 4 and Article 11, Section 17,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5287)|
| 1:28:14| it states that the Constitution is our power.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5294)|
| 1:28:17| I'm not saying we can't have an appointed superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5297)|
| 1:28:20| I'm just saying the wrong people are appointing them according to the Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5300)|
| 1:28:24| Well, not according to the Tennessee Supreme Court.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5304)|
| 1:28:29| Have they ruled the Constitution invalid, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5309)|
| 1:28:32| No, they did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5312)|
| 1:28:33| Well, you know, to change the Constitution, it takes two-thirds of the majority of the legislature,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5313)|
| 1:28:38| and then it has to go before the people to vote on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5318)|
| 1:28:42| Now, I can go along with this appointment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5322)|
| 1:28:45| but I think this needs to be clarified further down the line on who does have the authority.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5325)|
| 1:28:51| And I would like your opinion on it, not what the Supreme Court says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5331)|
| 1:28:56| Which one stands whole, the Constitution or the Supreme Court?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5336)|
| 1:29:02| As an attorney, I am governed by the Tennessee Supreme Court, and so is this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5342)|
| 1:29:11| The Supreme Court ruled in a case that I passed out, it was McWhirter, I believe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5351)|
| 1:29:18| versus Shelby County or Shelby County versus McWhirter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5358)|
| 1:29:22| that the legislation that provided for an elected superintendent through all of the BEP mechanism is constitutional.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5362)|
| 1:29:36| This body does not have the authority to make that appointment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5376)|
| 1:29:40| And it is solely a school board function.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5380)|
| 1:29:45| So that's what the Supreme Court said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5385)|
| 1:29:47| Now, we may disagree with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5387)|
| 1:29:49| We might disagree with what the Supreme Court said in the Jordan case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5389)|
| 1:29:52| but the law is what the Supreme Court said it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5392)|
| 1:29:58| And we're not going to change that by virtue of this meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5398)|
| 1:30:04| I'm going to ask you to direct a letter to the Attorney General in Nashville to give us a clear interpretation of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5404)|
| 1:30:16| I don't care what the Supreme Court says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5416)|
| 1:30:18| Our Constitution has not been changed, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5418)|
| 1:30:20| I care what the Supreme Court says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5420)|
| 1:30:22| Well, I do, too, in certain respects, but I'm not going to let them overrun our Constitution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5422)|
| 1:30:27| Now, I'm not here to argue, but the Constitution has to be changed or amended,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5427)|
| 1:30:31| and that has not been done and the Supreme Court has not done it because that is still part of our Constitution as of this very day.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5431)|
| 1:30:43| We need to move on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5443)|
| 1:30:44| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5444)|
| 1:30:45| Are you going to direct a letter to the Attorney General getting an opinion on it, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5445)|
| 1:30:49| No, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5449)|
| 1:30:54| Mr. Pinkson can write a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| Mr. Pinkson can write a letter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5456)|
| 1:30:57| I would suggest that you draft a letter and send it to the Attorney General.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5457)|
| 1:30:59| Well, I would suggest we probably don't need a law director then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| If by a vote of this body you ask me to write a letter, I'll write a letter if it's unclear to the majority of this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5463)|
| 1:31:16| I'm going to put that as a motion that you write a letter for us to get an interpretation on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5476)|
| 1:31:24| Do you want to add that to the agenda?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5484)|
| 1:31:27| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5487)|
| 1:31:29| Just sign us a number.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5489)|
| 1:31:31| We'll get to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5491)|
| 1:31:33| We need to go ahead, Commissioner DeFries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5493)|
| 1:31:37| I was just going to second that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5497)|
| 1:31:39| Well, he's going to be on the agenda.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5499)|
| 1:31:44| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5504)|
| 1:31:45| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5505)|
| 1:31:46| Are there any more?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5506)|
| 1:31:48| I have one more on Page 30, the second one, 084103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5508)|
| 1:31:56| The caption is wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5516)|
| 1:31:58| The caption should read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5518)|
| 1:32:01| as a consideration of an ordinance of the Commission of Knox County,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5521)|
| 1:32:05| Tennessee authorizes Knox County owned land facilities to be named after honorees only after they are deceased.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5525)|
| 1:32:14| You withdrew that one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5534)|
| 1:32:15| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5535)|
| 1:32:17| Is that the one you withdrew?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5537)|
| 1:32:18| Which one are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5538)|
| 1:32:19| 103.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5539)|
| 1:32:20| 103?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5540)|
| 1:32:21| Yes, I withdrew that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5541)|
| 1:32:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5542)|
| 1:32:23| That is the right caption.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5543)|
| 1:32:26| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5546)|
| 1:32:27| I didn't see it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5547)|
| 1:32:31| What, Page 3103?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5551)|
| 1:32:33| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5553)|
| 1:32:34| She withdrew it, but the caption was wrong with what she withdrew.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5554)|
| 1:32:37| Oh.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5557)|

| 1:33:03| Ken Knight, who's going to do something good for the commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5583)|
| 1:33:07| We have some nice things that are happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5587)|
| 1:33:20| Thank you, Chairman Strickland.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5600)|
| 1:33:23| My name is Ken Knight, and I'm this year's president of the Dogwood Arts Festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5603)|
| 1:33:26| And as most of you are, I'm sure, aware, we just wrapped up our 48th annual festival.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5606)|
| 1:33:32| We had record crowds at our House and Garden Show in February.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5612)|
| 1:33:36| Not only our artisans, but the people who do business every day on Market Square had record revenue days on the Saturday| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5616)|
| 1:33:43| of our festival on the square.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5623)|
| 1:33:45| And then we wrapped things up this past Friday night with our parade that we had to postpone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5625)|
| 1:33:49| but had about 8,000 people nevertheless.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5629)|
| 1:33:52| And also one of the good things we did this year was we brought back the student art show| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5632)|
| 1:33:55| and had roughly 50 entries from students from around Knox County| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5635)|
| 1:33:59| and handed out some nice cash awards to students and teachers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5639)|
| 1:34:02| So on behalf of the Dogwood Arts Festival and for an appreciation for everything that Knox County does to make it one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5642)|
| 1:34:09| of America's great festivals, I wanted to present you with one of this year's limited edition prints,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=5649)|

| 1:41:24| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6084)|
| 1:41:26| Commissioner DeFreeze.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6086)|
| 1:41:27| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6087)|
| 1:41:28| I just wanted to comment on that contract that we voted no on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6088)|
| 1:41:32| I didn't know if there was a window there for discussion, but in looking at that contract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6092)|
| 1:41:37| it looked to me that there was no caps on some of that as far as the travel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6097)|
| 1:41:44| And it didn't really say that it was in alignment with the county travel procedures or guidelines in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6104)|
| 1:41:52| I had just never seen a contract that was the breadth of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6112)|
| 1:41:56| And it was a four-year contract.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6116)|
| 1:41:58| So I was just very concerned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6118)|
| 1:42:00| I know that they're already paying out Lindsey out of some bucket of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6120)|
| 1:42:05| And now they think they've got this other bucket of money to pay a new superintendent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6125)|
| 1:42:11| So I called the mayor's office.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6131)|
| 1:42:13| I called the law director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6133)|
| 1:42:15| And I just wanted everybody to know that that was probably the equivalent to what the President of the United States gets as a package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6135)|
| 1:42:21| And I just thought that was rather alarming that a superintendent of Knox County Schools is going to get the same equivalent package.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6141)|
| 1:42:29| As far as travel, I mean, there is a provision within the contract that provides that the new superintendent must comply with all travel regulations and procedures.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6149)|
| 1:42:42| And he will be held to that standard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6162)|
| 1:42:47| Are we ready for the consent calendar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6167)|
| 1:42:53| Mr. Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6173)|
| 1:42:54| Mr. Chairman, I just want to iterate what she was saying real quick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6174)|
| 1:42:57| But I don't understand how our school superintendent can make more money than our county executive who he or she will ever be in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6177)|
| 1:43:05| And I was just real disturbed with everything that I saw in the contract that it got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6185)|
| 1:43:11| I mean, there's a lot of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6191)|
| 1:43:12| It comes out, takes his time off, he makes $5,800 a week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6192)|
| 1:43:18| And I don't know what the mayor makes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6198)|
| 1:43:20| I think he makes about $100,000 less, you know, and whoever the mayor is in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6200)|
| 1:43:23| But I think it was just a lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6203)|
| 1:43:25| And the meals, get all the meals paid for and whatnot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6205)|
| 1:43:28| I mean, you're making this kind of money and he pays for nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6208)|
| 1:43:31| I mean, everything is paid for him.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6211)|
| 1:43:37| Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6217)|
| 1:43:38| I guess my response to that is that, you know, we settled a lawsuit with the school board a few years ago that they get to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6218)|
| 1:43:46| decide how to spend the money that they're allocated.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6226)|
| 1:43:49| And fortunately or unfortunately, they've decided this is how they wish to spend the money that we're going to budget for them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6229)|
| 1:43:57| Well, just like Commissioner Moore just said, you know, we've not even approved next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6237)|
| 1:44:00| And we're giving this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6240)|
| 1:44:01| You know, next year is going to be a really tight year, really tight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6241)|
| 1:44:04| And this guy is getting quite a bit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6244)|
| 1:44:06| I understand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6246)|
| 1:44:07| And that's why the public ought to be questioning how the school board decides to spend their money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6247)|
| 1:44:13| I mean, I wish him the best.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6253)|
| 1:44:15| I'm with you 100%, Commissioner Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6255)|
| 1:44:18| But they get to decide how to spend that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6258)|
| 1:44:20| And we settled a lawsuit, which the public wanted us to settle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6260)|
| 1:44:25| And, you know, they're going to have to answer the question as to how they spend their money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6265)|
| 1:44:32| including the school superintendent's salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6272)|
| 1:44:34| They're not happy with Lindsey and they have to buy him out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6274)|
| 1:44:36| I mean, same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6276)|
| 1:44:38| And by law, we have to give them as much money as we gave them last year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6278)|
| 1:44:43| So the school board does know they're going to get that amount of money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6283)|
| 1:44:46| Do you have something, Commissioner Hammond?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6286)|
| 1:44:48| I was just going to add that we've been invited to two budget briefings by the school board.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6288)|
| 1:44:52| We got the letter today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6292)|
| 1:44:53| And so that will be an opportunity for any who have questions to question them then.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6293)|
| 1:44:57| Also, when we have budget hearings, there will be an opportunity to ask them those questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6297)|
| 1:45:03| So there will be an opportunity to ask those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6303)|
| 1:45:07| Are we ready for our consent calendar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6307)|
| 1:45:12| Would you read all the items in?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6312)|
| 1:45:19| I think all of them from 101 to 107.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6319)|
| 1:45:23| Mr. Chairman, did we pull 101 off consent?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6323)|

| 1:45:40| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6340)|
| 1:45:41| I thought we were still going to do all of them beginning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6341)|

| 1:45:57| Yeah, but we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6357)|
| 1:46:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6362)|
| 1:46:07| So we go to?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6367)|
| 1:46:14| Mr. Chairman, I would move we waive the reading of the 13 items on the consent if we are allowed to do so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6374)|
| 1:46:20| I think it's more than 13.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6380)|
| 1:46:22| Well, move the reading of the consent items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6382)|
| 1:46:26| If we are allowed to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6386)|
| 1:46:28| Allow the director to say we need to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6388)|
| 1:46:30| Then we'll do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=6390)|

| 2:02:07| They've been there. They're passionate along with myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7327)|
| 2:02:12| We've got community leaders that we've been very blessed with who have been supportive of our organization.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7332)|

| 2:03:00| I want to thank the mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7380)|
| 2:03:05| I'd be remiss if I didn't mention also two of your body have been huge supporters of ours, Ivan Harmon and Scott Moore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7385)|
| 2:03:10| And to both of you gentlemen, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7390)|
| 2:03:15| Thank you so very much for this recognition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7395)|
| 2:03:25| Resolution 102.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7405)|
| 2:03:30| It was deferred.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7410)|
| 2:03:35| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7415)|
| 2:03:40| Resolution 103 is memorializing Tarleton Heston.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7420)|
| 2:03:45| Voted 6-2 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7425)|
| 2:03:50| I'm going to get a second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7430)|
| 2:03:55| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7435)|
| 2:04:00| Property moved and seconded by Commissioner McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7440)|
| 2:04:05| Again, I'd really just like to ask the commissioners as we move forward that we put names forward like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7445)|
| 2:04:10| who's done outstanding local community activism like Mr.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7450)|
| 2:04:15| Heston and individuals like that that have been a service for Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7455)|
| 2:04:20| As I said in the lunch, I do feel that this is not a proper resolution in that while the Screen Actors Guild| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7460)|
| 2:04:30| or the NRA probably has done all kinds of things for Tarleton Heston,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7470)|
| 2:04:35| Knox County government probably is a little bit out of place in doing this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7475)|
| 2:04:41| And, you know, if we put other polarizing figures like, like I said earlier, like Jeremiah Wright,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7481)|
| 2:04:47| someone who I'm sure has gotten all kinds of accolades within the Chicago community over his career,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7487)|
| 2:04:53| but that's probably out of place to do it here in Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7493)|
| 2:04:57| So, again, I just ask the commissioners as we go forward that we really take a good look at the folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7497)|
| 2:05:03| that we're putting forward to be memorialized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7503)|
| 2:05:07| So that's why I'm voting no on this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7507)|
| 2:05:09| We have a motion on the floor to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7509)|
| 2:05:16| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7516)|

| 2:05:26| Let's do a roll call vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7526)|
| 2:05:31| It should be easier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7531)|

| 2:06:28| So it passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7588)|
| 2:06:29| Mr. Chairman, can I ask a question real quick with regard to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7589)|
| 2:06:30| Once this resolution is passed and this honorarium is, do we still have that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7590)|
| 2:06:54| once this resolution is passed and this honorarium is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7614)|
| 2:06:59| do we send it to Charlton Heston's family, or where does it go from here?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7619)|
| 2:07:04| I mean, do we request that his family comes here, that we can present it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7624)|
| 2:07:07| or what are the steps after we pass this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7627)|
| 2:07:10| I think I gave the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7630)|
| 2:07:15| I'm just going to mail it to the National Rifle Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7635)|
| 2:07:18| I usually give it to the commissioner that presented the resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7638)|
| 2:07:22| So you're just going to mail it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7642)|
| 2:07:23| I'm just going to mail it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7643)|

| 2:08:17| I'll be brief.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7697)|
| 2:08:18| I can't help being short.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7698)|
| 2:08:24| I'm glad we haven't kept these guys waiting any longer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7704)|
| 2:08:27| They specialize in slashing, elbowing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7707)|
| 2:08:31| But actually what they do most of all is play really great hockey.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7711)|
| 2:08:34| If you've not been to an Ice Bears game, you should.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7714)|
| 2:08:37| I matched in the Big Brothers program, my little one and I, Levi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7717)|
| 2:08:40| I think we've been to about eight or nine games this season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7720)|
| 2:08:43| and they've never disappointed, even when they lose, which is rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7723)|
| 2:08:46| They present a great brand of hockey,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7726)|
| 2:08:48| and they well deserve their recent multiple championships.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7728)|
| 2:08:52| And I just congratulate these Ice Bears.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7732)|
| 2:08:55| Thank you, Mr. Harmon and Mr. Ragsdale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7735)|
| 2:09:05| I would like to thank everyone for having us here in this forum to be recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7745)|
| 2:09:11| I know we have a lot of players and coaches,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7751)|
| 2:09:15| and to my left here is Mr. John Axford, our majority owner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7755)|
| 2:09:20| And to my further left is our marketing director, Mr. Kim Biddinger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7760)|
| 2:09:25| It's truly a team sport, not just the product on the ice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7765)|
| 2:09:29| but what we do during the off-season and off the ice to retain the growth that we've seen over this past year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7769)|
| 2:09:39| One of our goals, we've averaged over 4,000 people a night to watch us play,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7779)|
| 2:09:43| and one of our goals is to outgrow our building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7783)|
| 2:09:46| So I was going to see if we could maybe table a new event center in the county maybe,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7786)|
| 2:09:51| but that's maybe for another thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7791)|
| 2:09:55| I thought we were going to have a hockey fight here a little earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7795)|
| 2:09:57| That would have been, you know, in our business, we don't have to write letters.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7797)|
| 2:10:00| We just get people in the penalty box for five minutes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7800)|
| 2:10:02| and they get to come out and do it all over again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7802)|
| 2:10:05| But we truly appreciate the county residents for supporting us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7805)|
| 2:10:10| We really gear our sport to family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7810)|
| 2:10:13| and we've been very, very fortunate to have won two championships in three years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7813)|
| 2:10:19| And I do want to recognize that what we've done this year is something that I never thought would be possible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7819)|
| 2:10:25| Six weeks prior to the start of the season, I learned that our head coach was leaving.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7825)|
| 2:10:29| So we were able to attain both of these championships with a new coach only six weeks prior to the season,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7829)|
| 2:10:36| new office staff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7836)|
| 2:10:39| We only had three returning players, and to do all what we've done this year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7839)|
| 2:10:44| we couldn't have done it without the support of the county residents, and we truly appreciate that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7844)|
| 2:10:48| And like I said, our goal is to outgrow our building, and that's what we plan on doing next season.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7848)|
| 2:10:53| So thank you for having us, and thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=7853)|

| 2:14:29| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8069)|
| 2:14:30| That's every bit is federal funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8070)|
| 2:14:31| So no match.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8071)|
| 2:14:32| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8072)|
| 2:14:33| Next year, if we didn't do anything, we're still getting this money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8073)|
| 2:14:37| That's right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8077)|
| 2:14:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8078)|
| 2:14:39| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8079)|

| 2:14:53| Next will be 601 on page 21.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8093)|
| 2:15:05| Resolution 601 is approving a memorandum of understanding and agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8105)|
| 2:15:09| between Knox County, Rural Metro Corporation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8109)|

| 2:15:22| Voted 8-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8122)|
| 2:15:23| And I am going to disclose that this does have an association with Covenant Health,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8123)|
| 2:15:28| which my wife is a nurse at Fort Sanders Hospital, which is owned by Covenant Health.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8128)|

| 2:15:36| 8-0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8136)|
| 2:15:37| So moved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8137)|
| 2:15:38| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8138)|
| 2:15:41| Commissioner Briggs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8141)|
| 2:15:43| I just wanted to make a few comments about this resolution because this is also one of these things that I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8143)|
| 2:15:50| government is doing good for the people of this county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8150)|
| 2:15:54| It's what you would call taxpayer value for what we're investing and what we're getting out of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8154)|
| 2:15:59| What this is is that, and it's also a very good example of collaboration between the mayor's office,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8159)|
| 2:16:06| the health department, Rural Metro, and the hospitals in this area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8166)|
| 2:16:11| Right now, I believe that Covenant Health has either signed or they've signed on to this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8171)|
| 2:16:15| and I would anticipate that the other hospitals will, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8175)|
| 2:16:18| I know it's under consideration at the Mercy Health System, which is St. Mary's is the hospital with that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8178)|
| 2:16:25| and it's also under the University of Tennessee is also considering this, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8185)|
| 2:16:30| What this is is that Rural Metro will purchase 12 lead EKGs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8190)|
| 2:16:37| Now, an EKG is where they put the little sticky tabs on a person when they're having chest pain,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8197)|
| 2:16:43| both to diagnose an irregular heart rhythm and also to diagnose a myocardial infarction or a heart attack.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8203)|
| 2:16:51| There will be transmitters on the 12 EKG that can send those back to the hospital emergency rooms,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8211)|
| 2:16:58| which have the receivers where the emergency room physicians and cardiologists| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8218)|
| 2:17:02| or any other interested physician will be able to view these.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8222)|
| 2:17:07| It's important because a heart attack occurs when a clot forms in an artery on the heart.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8227)|
| 2:17:14| As soon as that artery clots off, heart muscle is starting to die and time is of the essence.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8234)|
| 2:17:20| Now in Knox County, for the most part, what happens is when someone's having a heart attack,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8240)|
| 2:17:25| they come to the emergency room, they get their 12 lead EKG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8245)|
| 2:17:28| The emergency room physician has to call the cardiologist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8248)|
| 2:17:32| He has to then, particularly if it's at night or on the weekends, call the cardiac catheterization laboratory.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8252)|
| 2:17:37| Time is wasting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8257)|
| 2:17:38| Heart muscle is dying.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8258)|
| 2:17:40| Lives are being lost or people can become disabled because they've lost enough heart muscle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8260)|
| 2:17:45| They can no longer go back to work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8265)|
| 2:17:47| What this will allow the emergency medical technicians to do is to connect this up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8267)|
| 2:17:53| This is a state-of-the-art system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8273)|
| 2:17:55| It's transmitted by the Internet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8275)|
| 2:17:57| It can be archived in the hospital's computer system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8277)|
| 2:18:00| It can then be transmitted out to any handheld devices, to cardiologists at their homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8280)|
| 2:18:05| if they're not in the hospital.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8285)|
| 2:18:07| And even before the patient arrives in the emergency room,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8287)|
| 2:18:10| they can be mobilizing the cardiac catheterization people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8290)|
| 2:18:14| So really, if it works well, the ambulance in the emergency room just serves as a transportation corridor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8294)|
| 2:18:22| from the time the person arrives at the hospital straight to the cardiac catheterization laboratory,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8302)|
| 2:18:27| where the cardiologist will have the opportunity to perform interventions to try to get blood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8307)|
| 2:18:32| What they do is you hear about the angioplasties and the stents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8312)|
| 2:18:36| but they're able to get the artery open and get blood back into the muscle and try to save that heart muscle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8316)|
| 2:18:42| It's one of the few programs that we really will have that benefits every single| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8322)|
| 2:18:47| or could potentially benefit every single citizen in this county,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8327)|
| 2:18:51| from the wealthiest of our citizens to the poorest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8331)|
| 2:18:54| Looking out here in the audience and in the people at home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8334)|
| 2:18:57| I can tell you right now that 80 percent of us are going to die of heart attacks or strokes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8337)|
| 2:19:02| And this is one of the things that we have available that can not only save lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8342)|
| 2:19:06| but it will return people back to being productive citizens.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8346)|
| 2:19:09| I think it's an excellent program because it shows it's a taxpayer value,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8349)|
| 2:19:14| is that it's going to cost roughly, and if I'm mistaking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8354)|
| 2:19:18| someone from the health department can correct me, about $40,000 to the taxpayer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8358)|
| 2:19:23| But when this gets multiplied by what Rural Metro puts in, which is a private company,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8363)|
| 2:19:28| what the nonprofit hospitals put in, I think the taxpayers are getting an excellent value for their tax dollars| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8368)|
| 2:19:34| and an excellent value for the amount of money put into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8374)|
| 2:19:37| And just as a final word, there's different systems out here,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8377)|
| 2:19:41| and I've looked at some of these and talked to cardiologists and other people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8381)|
| 2:19:44| and this is really a state-of-the-art system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8384)|
| 2:19:47| It will be something that is really no one anywhere in the United States or the world, for that matter,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8387)|
| 2:19:54| will have a better system than we do with this once it's online.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8394)|
| 2:20:04| We have a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8404)|
| 2:20:05| Commissioner Hammond.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8405)|
| 2:20:06| Just a couple of questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8406)|
| 2:20:07| I've received a couple of phone calls, and first of all, this is great.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8407)|
| 2:20:10| I'm glad we're doing it, and I applaud you for doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8410)|
| 2:20:13| Apparently, there are two different systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8413)|
| 2:20:15| One is called Zole, and the other system, I must admit I have forgotten the name of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8415)|
| 2:20:21| Which system are we getting?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8421)|
| 2:20:24| This is the Medtronic system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8424)|
| 2:20:26| You know, Medtronic is a large medical device company.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8426)|
| 2:20:30| There are several different systems out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8430)|
| 2:20:32| Some of them work basically using cell phone technology| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8432)|
| 2:20:35| where they can hook someone up and it's sent to a fax machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8435)|
| 2:20:39| There's others, I'm sure, that are good.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8439)|
| 2:20:43| The reason that I think, at least technologically, this is an excellent system| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8443)|
| 2:20:48| is because there's a thing called HIPAA, which is basically patient privacy issues,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8448)|
| 2:20:53| and this is HIPAA compliant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8453)|
| 2:20:55| It can be sent by, and don't ask me the details of this, through encryption,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8455)|
| 2:21:01| where for anybody that would want to, for reasons I can't imagine why,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8461)|
| 2:21:05| would want to try to intercept that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8465)|
| 2:21:07| This would be very difficult to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8467)|
| 2:21:09| Also, because it's archived into the hospital's computer system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8469)|
| 2:21:14| someone sitting in Oak Ridge, if it was one of the cardiologists was up there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8474)|
| 2:21:19| or one of the surgeons were up there making rounds,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8479)|
| 2:21:21| they could look on the Internet and see this EKG.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8481)|
| 2:21:25| It will go to the handheld devices as if they're in their car,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8485)|
| 2:21:29| and I think it has advantages over some of the other systems.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8489)|
| 2:21:33| It's really a third-generation, state-of-the-art system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8493)|
| 2:21:35| but I do know, I am aware that some of the others are out there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8495)|
| 2:21:38| And Zola's a good company, but it's going to be difficult to beat this system.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8498)|
| 2:21:44| So this is a system you feel that we'll be able to use for years down the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8504)|
| 2:21:47| It won't become obsolete in a couple of years or anything like that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8507)|
| 2:21:49| Well, technology's always changing, and I really wouldn't want to venture a guess| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8509)|
| 2:21:53| on how long it'll be the state-of-the-art technology,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8513)|
| 2:21:56| but at least when this system comes on board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8516)|
| 2:21:58| there will be no system I think is more technologically advanced than this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8518)|
| 2:22:02| And also maybe for rural metro,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8522)|
| 2:22:04| the synergy between rural metro and the City Fire Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8524)|
| 2:22:07| does the City Fire Department have a system?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8527)|
| 2:22:10| I would rather someone else answer that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8530)|
| 2:22:12| I'm just wondering if these are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8532)|
| 2:22:13| The City Fire Department does have a system,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8533)|
| 2:22:16| but I believe theirs is a cell telephone transmission essentially by fax machine.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8536)|
| 2:22:25| I mean, it's good, but it just doesn't have the flexibility of this to transmit the data on,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8545)|
| 2:22:30| and I think that's accurate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8550)|
| 2:22:32| And if someone out there has more information about the City Fire Department.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8552)|
| 2:22:37| But there wouldn't be any issues as far as this system being compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8557)|
| 2:22:39| with anything that might happen up on the scene on a need to transmit?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8559)|
| 2:22:42| It's a different system, I think, because it's different technology.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8562)|
| 2:22:48| It's just that this one, I think, in my opinion, is much more advanced.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8568)|
| 2:22:51| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8571)|
| 2:22:53| We have a motion on the floor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8573)|
| 2:22:55| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8575)|
| 2:22:56| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8576)|
| 2:22:57| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8577)|
| 2:22:58| The ayes have it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8578)|
| 2:23:00| 602.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8580)|
| 2:23:03| Resolution 602 is approving a grant agreement in the amount of $50,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8583)|
| 2:23:08| with the State of Tennessee Department of Health| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8588)|
| 2:23:11| for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Services for fiscal year 2008-2009.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8591)|
| 2:23:17| Intergovernmental?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8597)|
| 2:23:18| Approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8598)|
| 2:23:19| 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8599)|
| 2:23:20| Finance?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8600)|
| 2:23:21| 8-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8601)|
| 2:23:22| Move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8602)|
| 2:23:23| Dr. Briggs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8603)|
| 2:23:27| Who seconded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8607)|
| 2:23:30| Who was the second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8610)|
| 2:23:34| I'll second if it hasn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8614)|
| 2:23:35| Dr. Briggs did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8615)|
| 2:23:37| Commissioner Moore?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8617)|
| 2:23:38| I guess this question is back to John Troyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8618)|
| 2:23:42| I see it has a small local match with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8622)|
| 2:23:46| Is it in this year's budget paying out for next year's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8626)|
| 2:23:49| It's in next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8629)|
| 2:23:51| I spoke with Mark Jones about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8631)|
| 2:23:53| and it's important to him to move this contract forward so he can get it in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8633)|
| 2:23:58| so it's effective July 1st, but it is next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8638)|
| 2:24:03| Okay, because I remember last year I talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8643)|
| 2:24:06| and we went ahead and approved a lot of things in front.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8646)|
| 2:24:10| But if we approve these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8650)|
| 2:24:11| then it would certainly have to be a next year's budget that gets approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8651)|
| 2:24:15| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8655)|
| 2:24:16| So we'd have to seek the advice of the law director,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8656)|
| 2:24:20| but it would be subject to appropriations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8660)|
| 2:24:23| I think that's how the contract would be written.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8663)|
| 2:24:26| Mr. Law Director?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8666)|
| 2:24:30| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8670)|
| 2:24:31| So it's not you're saying it's in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8671)|
| 2:24:33| If the budget didn't get approved or this got cut out, it's?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8673)|
| 2:24:38| This is not going to be paid out before next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8678)|
| 2:24:43| Is the money in there or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8683)|
| 2:24:45| Is it in there this year or not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8685)|
| 2:24:46| It's next year's budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8686)|
| 2:24:48| Is this the contract for next year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8688)|
| 2:24:52| If it's not there, it's not there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8692)|
| 2:24:57| This is different from the superintendent's contract| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8697)|
| 2:25:00| where the mayor has basically certified that the funds are there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8700)|
| 2:25:05| They're present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8705)|
| 2:25:06| They're available.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8706)|
| 2:25:08| I don't know that this fits in that category at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8708)|
| 2:25:11| No, what we're saying is that it's our intent to include that in the mayor's proposed budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8711)|
| 2:25:15| but the commission has not taken that up yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8715)|
| 2:25:19| So it's up to the will of this commission where you wish to pass it now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8719)|
| 2:25:22| or you wish to pass it after the budget passes?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8722)|
| 2:25:28| So I don't think, and this is a commission decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8728)|
| 2:25:33| I'm glad that Commissioner Moore recognizes the fiscal situation that we're in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8733)|
| 2:25:39| but it was important to Mark Jones to get the pieces in place so he could be effective.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8739)|
| 2:25:43| Well, I understand that, John.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8743)|
| 2:25:44| I understand Mark's concerns as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8744)|
| 2:25:47| I mean, because I think by the time the budget comes around,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8747)|
| 2:25:50| the health department will come here next month wanting some additional contracts in place prior to July 1st| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8750)|
| 2:25:55| of the new budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8755)|
| 2:25:57| But if we approve these things, then we have no control of the budget in those items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8757)|
| 2:26:03| We would already have to, basically, we're approving something that we haven't even looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8763)|
| 2:26:09| Just one more point, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8769)|
| 2:26:10| This is also a state contract where they would like to get their budget, you know, approved too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8770)|
| 2:26:16| Well, I mean, I understand that, Mark, but we're approving something we haven't even seen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8776)|
| 2:26:21| And this may be a great program for teenage pregnancies and whatever,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8781)|
| 2:26:25| but what if it comes down to being able to put ten more kids in a classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8785)|
| 2:26:29| I mean, we're going to have to weigh out what's the most important in this community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8789)|
| 2:26:34| Is it for government to be parents to tell people that or have seats for kids to sit in a classroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8794)|
| 2:26:43| And I think until we see a budget, as I said last year,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8803)|
| 2:26:46| we don't need to be approving things in the front of us even seeing the budget,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8806)|
| 2:26:52| and the budget's not going to be out until what, May 14th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8812)|
| 2:26:57| So if we pass this in May or soon after we pass the budget, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8817)|
| 2:27:03| what does that do to you?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8823)|
| 2:27:06| In order to get it back to Nashville, I mean, in order for it to be effective on July 1st,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8826)|
| 2:27:12| it would have to be approved today.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8832)|
| 2:27:17| Mark, these funds are coming from the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8837)|
| 2:27:19| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8839)|
| 2:27:20| Except that there's a problem with this grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8840)|
| 2:27:24| It's an old grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8844)|
| 2:27:25| We've had it at the Health Department for at least 15 years, and it's just kind of outgrown.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8845)|
| 2:27:32| It stayed static where it is, and it's outgrown the funding.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8852)|
| 2:27:37| So there's a $7,900 local match on a $50,000 grant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8857)|
| 2:27:43| So our match is just $7,900?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8863)|
| 2:27:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8865)|
| 2:27:47| Commissioner?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8867)|
| 2:27:49| Well, hang on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8869)|
| 2:27:51| I'd make a motion that we defer this until after the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8871)|
| 2:27:56| A substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8876)|
| 2:27:57| Substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8877)|
| 2:28:00| Do I have a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8880)|
| 2:28:02| I'll second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8882)|
| 2:28:05| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8885)|
| 2:28:08| A discussion on the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8888)|
| 2:28:10| Commissioner Daniels?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8890)|
| 2:28:12| Point of clarification, did you say that if we don't vote on it today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8892)|
| 2:28:17| then it goes away because of the state?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8897)|
| 2:28:21| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8901)|
| 2:28:22| There's an effort.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8902)|
| 2:28:23| I don't know that that will be the situation,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8903)|
| 2:28:25| but there's an effort to try to get the contracts on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8905)|
| 2:28:28| I know at different times the commissioners have asked me why we will get a contract in September| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8908)|
| 2:28:35| when it started in July.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8915)|
| 2:28:37| So the Commissioner of Health has made a real effort to try to get the contracts timely,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8917)|
| 2:28:42| and that's really what the issue is, is getting it back so that it's approved| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8922)|
| 2:28:47| and signed by the Commissioner of Health in Nashville, and then it will start on July 1st.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8927)|
| 2:28:53| So that's what the motion is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8933)|
| 2:28:55| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8935)|
| 2:28:57| I'm kind of in agreement with Commissioner Moore in that even though it's a small amount of money,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8937)|
| 2:29:03| you are kind of tying our hands and we're already obligated to put this money forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8943)|
| 2:29:10| But my question is, I guess, a little deeper in that this has been a 15-year program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8950)|
| 2:29:17| What are our metrics of success?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8957)|
| 2:29:19| How are we doing?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8959)|
| 2:29:22| Teenage and adolescent pregnancies are probably up over that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8962)|
| 2:29:27| I think if you look at Knox County's rates, we're down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8967)|
| 2:29:31| We're down over the 15-year?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8971)|
| 2:29:33| Well, I don't know about 15 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8973)|
| 2:29:36| We're down over what we've been in the past compared to the rest of the state.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8976)|
| 2:29:40| Could you provide me with local, state, and national numbers over that 15-year period?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8980)|
| 2:29:46| Yes, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8986)|
| 2:29:47| I'd be glad to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8987)|
| 2:29:48| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8988)|
| 2:29:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8991)|
| 2:29:52| Mark, is it fair to say, I understand Scott,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8992)|
| 2:29:55| and I sort of agree with him on the funding part and when we do it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8995)|
| 2:29:58| but I don't guess there's true numbers for every pregnancy that is prevented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=8998)|
| 2:30:05| But I would say a lot of these that would be and is prevented,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9005)|
| 2:30:09| also these would be people that would be on different programs that the county provides| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9009)|
| 2:30:14| because it would be people that would typically qualify for food stamps, WIC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9014)|
| 2:30:22| and those sort of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9022)|
| 2:30:26| I mean, other than just the grant money, I mean, it's sort of a total process there, isn't it?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9026)|
| 2:30:35| If you prevent it, I mean, the pregnancy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9035)|
| 2:30:37| Oh, as far as the ripple effect?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9037)|
| 2:30:40| Absolutely.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9040)|
| 2:30:41| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9041)|
| 2:30:42| Where do you teach this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9042)|
| 2:30:43| And where do they go to get the benefit of this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9043)|
| 2:30:46| Is it in schools or?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9046)|
| 2:30:48| It's done with the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9048)|
| 2:30:50| There's various.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9050)|
| 2:30:53| Cynthia Hudson, some of you all may know Cynthia,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9053)|
| 2:30:56| has been involved in this program for probably the whole 15 years, very active in the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9056)|
| 2:31:02| She does different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9062)|
| 2:31:04| She's got a truck.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9064)|
| 2:31:05| She takes it around to the schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9065)|
| 2:31:07| She just last week or the week before last, at the Second Presbyterian Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9067)|
| 2:31:14| there was a, with joint sponsorship of the church, there was a kind of what you would call a fair| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9074)|
| 2:31:22| where the teenagers that are pregnant were bused over.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9082)|
| 2:31:29| I mean, I actually attended that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9089)|
| 2:31:31| It's just a very beneficial program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9091)|
| 2:31:33| It's been a very successful program, this program has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9093)|
| 2:31:36| And I certainly will be glad to provide you with information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9096)|
| 2:31:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9099)|
| 2:31:40| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9100)|
| 2:31:44| Commissioner Hamlin.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9104)|
| 2:31:46| Mark, I'm wondering, that $7,900 they're asking us for goes to salaries and benefits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9106)|
| 2:31:50| I'm assuming that's one salary or a portion of a salary.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9110)|
| 2:31:54| Do you think if we were to approve this without the $7,900 match| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9114)|
| 2:32:01| and revisit it during the budget process that they would go along with that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9121)|
| 2:32:06| I would think so, Commissioner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9126)|
| 2:32:09| We had to put that in it to balance out the budget, if you look at the budget sheet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9129)|
| 2:32:18| Well, I would be in favor of going ahead and passing it since we're going to be getting $50,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9138)|
| 2:32:22| without the $7,900 match and revisit it during the budget if they would go along with that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9142)|
| 2:32:26| Then that way we have no obligation, but we know we're going to get the $50,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9146)|
| 2:32:29| and let them have that in their budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9149)|
| 2:32:33| We have a substitute motion on the floor to defer to after the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9153)|
| 2:32:43| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9163)|
| 2:32:45| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9165)|

| 2:32:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9167)|

| 2:33:06| Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9186)|
| 2:33:07| If I should have had a roll call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9187)|
| 2:33:08| Give them six.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9188)|
| 2:33:12| Six yes and 13 no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9192)|
| 2:33:16| We're back on the original motion to pass.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9196)|
| 2:33:19| All in favor say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9199)|
| 2:33:20| Aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9200)|
| 2:33:21| I'd like to make a substitute motion that we go ahead and my substitute would be that we go ahead| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9201)|
| 2:33:24| and pass the $50,000 without the matching of $7,900 and revisit the $7,900 when we do the budget.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9204)|
| 2:33:32| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9212)|
| 2:33:35| We have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9215)|
| 2:33:36| I think you all heard it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9216)|

| 2:33:39| Opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9219)|
| 2:33:43| Passes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9223)|

| 2:34:00| Resolution 8.04 is to approve determining the method of disposal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9240)|
| 2:34:06| What about 8.02 and 8.03?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9246)|
| 2:34:10| We're coming back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9250)|
| 2:34:11| You put them on consent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9251)|

| 2:34:14| We didn't read them and you didn't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9254)|
| 2:34:17| 8.04.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9257)|
| 2:34:22| 8.04 is a resolution to approve determining the method of disposal of the Old South High School property to be by somebody.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9262)|
| 2:34:36| Kinder Governmental.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9276)|

| 2:34:41| 8.0 to approve.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9281)|
| 2:34:44| Mr. Chairman, I will move to approve with the blank being filled in with the word sealed bid.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9284)|
| 2:34:52| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9292)|
| 2:34:56| I'd like to make a substitute motion on that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9296)|
| 2:35:00| I would like for this to be a public auction where everyone out here will be advertised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9300)|
| 2:35:06| and every citizen in Knox County or anywhere else will have the right to bid on this property, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9306)|
| 2:35:13| We have a substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9313)|
| 2:35:14| Can I get a second?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9314)|
| 2:35:17| Is there any discussion on the substitute motion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9317)|
| 2:35:22| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9322)|
| 2:35:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9325)|
| 2:35:26| I had a citizen from South Knoxville call and I had actually given out some other commissioners' numbers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9326)|
| 2:35:31| I guess they weren't able to get a hold of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9331)|
| 2:35:36| But they were interested in some conditions of this sale to protect the two big trees out in front of the school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9336)|
| 2:35:44| and they are really nice-looking trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9344)|
| 2:35:47| And I'm wondering, is there anything we can do to have a condition on the sale that there be some protection for those trees?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9347)|
| 2:36:02| I'm sure you have some questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9362)|
| 2:36:05| I think whoever acquires the property, I think you would need to request that of them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9365)|
| 2:36:15| It would be their property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9375)|
| 2:36:19| Mr. Chairman, the city has a tree policy in effect.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9379)|
| 2:36:22| That's inside the corporate city limits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9382)|
| 2:36:23| You know, if they do anything, they require you to plant so many trees.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9383)|
| 2:36:26| If you take one down and all that, is that not correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9386)|
| 2:36:29| I'm not sure about the tree policy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9389)|
| 2:36:34| I know they have a tree policy, but I don't know what it says.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9394)|
| 2:36:38| You have to be careful here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9398)|
| 2:36:39| We've tried four times to get rid of this building, and we have to be careful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9399)|
| 2:36:42| We can't just tie somebody's hands on it and keep it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9402)|
| 2:36:46| So we need to be careful what kind of stipulations we do put on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9406)|
| 2:36:50| I think purchasing is going to put that they have to get in there and stabilize the building with a roof| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9410)|
| 2:36:55| and some things like that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9415)|
| 2:36:57| We can't completely tie people's hands on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9417)|
| 2:37:00| And it has to come before us again before we can get rid of it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9420)|
| 2:37:03| So I think it's about time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9423)|
| 2:37:06| Commissioner Luthor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9426)|
| 2:37:07| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9427)|
| 2:37:09| I'd like to ask the maker of the motion if he would accept a friendly amendment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9429)|
| 2:37:14| and that would be that the purchaser would not be allowed to obtain a TIF for county funds.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9434)|
| 2:37:22| Well, as you know, I would be against that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9442)|
| 2:37:24| because we lost the first one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9444)|
| 2:37:26| The editorial yesterday in the paper was wrong when it stated that, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9446)|
| 2:37:31| this would go back on the tax rolls.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9451)|
| 2:37:33| It would after 12 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9453)|
| 2:37:35| I believe Lee Birch asked for a $500,000 TIF on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9455)|
| 2:37:39| and that's why Commissioner Clark, as you might say, led the charge, as he said, against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9459)|
| 2:37:46| You know.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9466)|
| 2:37:47| I would be glad.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9467)|
| 2:37:48| So you accept the amendment of no TIFs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9468)|
| 2:37:52| The second agrees to that?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9472)|
| 2:37:56| I don't know who seconded it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9476)|
| 2:37:57| Oh, I did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9477)|
| 2:37:58| Yes, I would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9478)|
| 2:37:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9479)|
| 2:38:00| So the amendment, you agree to the amendment that there would be no TIFs?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9480)|
| 2:38:06| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9486)|
| 2:38:07| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9487)|
| 2:38:08| Commissioner Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9488)|
| 2:38:09| I just wanted to say that I have had a lot of people call about trying to save this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9489)|
| 2:38:15| and I am in favor of trying to do what we can to do this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9495)|
| 2:38:19| I have talked to several people, and the school board, as I understand,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9499)|
| 2:38:25| I talked to Chair Karen Carson,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9505)|
| 2:38:27| and she said that if the building could be stabilized and renovated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9507)|
| 2:38:31| they could probably find some potential uses for such.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9511)|
| 2:38:34| And one of those potential uses that I investigated is there's a professor at UT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9514)|
| 2:38:39| His name is Dr. Bob Cronick, and he has what's called Clinic Vols program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9519)|
| 2:38:43| It's in our schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9523)|
| 2:38:46| And what he is interested in doing is creating a program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9526)|
| 2:38:49| It's called University Assisted Community Schools.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9529)|
| 2:38:52| And what that allows for is a doctor and kind of a clinic attached to a school,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9532)|
| 2:38:58| and there's also a pharmacy associated with this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9538)|
| 2:39:01| Now, this is something that he has presented to Dr. McIntyre and to the school board,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9541)|
| 2:39:06| and it's a program that they're interested in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9546)|
| 2:39:09| They just are looking at different facilities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9549)|
| 2:39:12| He has a federal grant of $2.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9552)|
| 2:39:15| and then also a matching gift amount of $2.5 million| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9555)|
| 2:39:18| to try to get this program off and running.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9558)|
| 2:39:21| He just needs a site.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9561)|
| 2:39:23| And so when I checked with him and said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9563)|
| 2:39:25| is this a suitable site for you since it is associated,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9565)|
| 2:39:28| Dogwood Elementary is right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9568)|
| 2:39:30| There's also that rec center.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9570)|
| 2:39:31| He said that that would be a wonderful place for him if we as a community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9571)|
| 2:39:35| would try to preserve that building so that we can move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9575)|
| 2:39:39| and try to tie in several different things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9579)|
| 2:39:45| Commissioner McKenzie?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9585)|
| 2:39:48| I don't know if I'm in order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9588)|
| 2:39:49| So now we're actually also speaking on the friendly amendment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9589)|
| 2:39:54| not to have a TIF associated with that, am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9594)|
| 2:39:58| No, we're talking about the substitute motion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9598)|
| 2:40:00| and the amendment on the substitute motion, which he agreed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9600)|
| 2:40:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9603)|
| 2:40:04| It's all part of the substitute motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9604)|
| 2:40:06| I would just like to speak as to why we're choosing this point to draw a line| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9606)|
| 2:40:11| in the sand when, I mean, if any property that I've seen the county deal with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9611)|
| 2:40:16| that is in disrepair or really meets the blighted tag,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9616)|
| 2:40:23| this one, if any, does, that's been voted,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9623)|
| 2:40:27| that's been passed over the last few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9627)|
| 2:40:29| So I guess I'm just questioning as to why we're choosing this project to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9629)|
| 2:40:32| no TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9632)|
| 2:40:33| Is that where we're going going forward or is there something, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9633)|
| 2:40:37| not blighted about this piece of property as opposed to some of the others| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9637)|
| 2:40:41| that we've approved in the past, this body has approved in the past?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9641)|
| 2:40:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9646)|
| 2:40:48| Well, I can't tell you the reason why anyone makes a motion or resolution.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9648)|
| 2:40:56| Just something that's on their mind at that particular time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9656)|
| 2:41:01| Mr. Chairman, I think in my mind it's so that we don't give someone the hope| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9661)|
| 2:41:08| or to go out here and try to get this building for a dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9668)|
| 2:41:11| and then come back and ask taxpayers to spend another 500,000| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9671)|
| 2:41:15| or a million or two million on this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9675)|
| 2:41:18| This way the public knows that if they go out here and buy it at public auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9678)|
| 2:41:21| they're responsible for bringing it up to codes and their self| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9681)|
| 2:41:26| and do whatever they choose to do with the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9686)|
| 2:41:29| So, you know, when you're dealing with public property, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9689)|
| 2:41:32| we don't need to turn around and give it to someone for a dollar| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9692)|
| 2:41:35| and then give them the money to go with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9695)|
| 2:41:38| This is a motion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9698)|
| 2:41:39| May I do that deal?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9699)|
| 2:41:41| It's a motion we can pass it up or down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9701)|
| 2:41:44| Commissioner Harmon.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9704)|
| 2:41:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9706)|
| 2:41:48| I know some of us want to save this building,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9708)|
| 2:41:50| but let's not save it in the worst possible manner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9710)|
| 2:41:54| And this current two-headed resolution bothers me on two fronts.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9714)|
| 2:42:00| The first part, Commissioner McKenzie addressed it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9720)|
| 2:42:02| This is the classic case of a blighted property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9722)|
| 2:42:05| where a TIF should be something that should be considered on its own merits later.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9725)|
| 2:42:10| Okay?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9730)|
| 2:42:11| And the other part of it is that an auction is something that goes to the highest bidder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9731)|
| 2:42:16| Well, this is a property with very little upfront value.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9736)|
| 2:42:20| You have to put a lot into it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9740)|
| 2:42:21| That's why a sealed bid where you can look at trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9741)|
| 2:42:26| and impact and all these other things makes more sense in the process in this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9746)|
| 2:42:32| This is the classic case where you need a sealed bid, where you don't do an auction,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9752)|
| 2:42:36| and where you save the TIF question until later when you see if it meets the criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9756)|
| 2:42:41| and it really is dealing with the question of a blighted property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9761)|
| 2:42:44| So I think the current way we have configured it is the wrong way of doing it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9764)|
| 2:42:48| So I'd like to go back to the sealed bid process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9768)|
| 2:42:51| and get back to a way that I think makes more sense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9771)|
| 2:42:58| Commissioner Lambert.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9778)|
| 2:43:03| I actually agree with Mr. Pinkston that this should be sold at public auctions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9783)|
| 2:43:08| but I emphatically disagree with having a condition that the person can never seek a TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9788)|
| 2:43:17| Most likely this property will be stabilized and on off in the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9797)|
| 2:43:23| if a TIF is needed to restore the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9803)|
| 2:43:27| That will be a decision for possibly this commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9807)|
| 2:43:31| but most likely another commission in the future.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9811)|
| 2:43:33| And I just don't think we need to make those decisions for the future commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9813)|
| 2:43:39| We need to trust that at the time someone comes up and asks for a TIF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9819)|
| 2:43:44| that this commission, whether it's those of us who are sitting here now| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9824)|
| 2:43:48| or those that follow us, will have the wisdom to discern whether it's a good TIF or a bad TIF.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9828)|
| 2:43:53| So I'm not going to vote for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9833)|
| 2:43:56| It's not that I'm against public auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9836)|
| 2:43:59| It's that I do not want to take that tool.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9839)|
| 2:44:02| And it's a tool that, granted, could be misused,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9842)|
| 2:44:05| but it's a tool that has also been well used with a number of aerial buildings,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9845)|
| 2:44:09| and so I don't want to vote to take that tool away from future commissioners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9849)|
| 2:44:15| Commissioner Norman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9855)|
| 2:44:18| Thank you, Mr. Chairman.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9858)|
| 2:44:19| A couple of items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9859)|
| 2:44:21| One, I'd like for Ms. Kim Trent to come and make comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9861)|
| 2:44:26| She's from Knox Heritage about what they feel about is proper use for the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9866)|
| 2:44:33| And then also, and this is just a question for the body,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9873)|
| 2:44:37| and that is I wonder about the cost of the auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9877)|
| 2:44:41| Will the cost of the auction be higher than the value of the property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9881)|
| 2:44:52| Ms. Trent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9892)|
| 2:44:57| Hi.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9897)|
| 2:44:58| How are you all today?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9898)|
| 2:44:59| Thank you so much for bringing up this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9899)|
| 2:45:01| I think it has a short timeline that we need to act on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9901)|
| 2:45:05| Just a few comments I'll say.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9905)|
| 2:45:07| South High is pretty much the poster child for two important lessons I have learned in preservation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9907)|
| 2:45:13| One, if it were easy, it would already be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9913)|
| 2:45:16| And number two, I've learned patience, which has been the most difficult thing for me to learn,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9916)|
| 2:45:22| and if you know me, you understand that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9922)|
| 2:45:24| To talk about the first one, if it were easy, it would already be done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9924)|
| 2:45:28| The history of the school is important to South Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9928)|
| 2:45:31| It is one of the most engaging issues we've had at Knox Heritage.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9931)|
| 2:45:36| People are always calling, emailing, what's going on with South High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9936)|
| 2:45:39| Even after six years, it has not fallen off the radar screen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9939)|
| 2:45:42| So it's important to that community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9942)|
| 2:45:45| And the process of the last developer looking at financing the project,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9945)|
| 2:45:50| he looked at historic preservation tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9950)|
| 2:45:52| The building has been declared as eligible for the National Register of Historic Places.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9952)|
| 2:45:57| That does make it eligible for historic preservation tax credits| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9957)|
| 2:46:00| and really highlights the importance of that building to this community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9960)|
| 2:46:04| the state of Tennessee, and the nation as a whole.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9964)|
| 2:46:08| A lot of people who may have seen the pictures in the Sentinel| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9968)|
| 2:46:11| or seen the video that Commissioner Lambert was nice enough to share with everyone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9971)|
| 2:46:16| when you first walk into these buildings and you're not used to seeing them,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9976)|
| 2:46:20| it can be pretty shocking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9980)|
| 2:46:22| But for those of us who've done this a lot, it's just par for the course, what's going on at South High.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9982)|
| 2:46:27| It was raining in the Millers building for many years before that building was brought back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9987)|
| 2:46:33| Tyson Junior High was not a peach when I saw it before Sam Furrow redid it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9993)|
| 2:46:39| So there are a lot of examples like the Sturkey building, which is now generating people living downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=9999)|
| 2:46:45| increasing the tax base, the sales tax base, not in good shape at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10005)|
| 2:46:50| Also, the other reason why this is difficult,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10010)|
| 2:46:53| and I'll have to speak to the TIF issue on this, is the financing is difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10013)|
| 2:46:57| This building has been allowed to sit without maintenance for 20 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10017)|
| 2:47:02| That is making the price tag to restore it very high.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10022)|
| 2:47:06| One of the reasons the city of Knoxville initiated the effort to provide TIF financing for historic schools| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10026)|
| 2:47:12| that are blighted in communities is they understand it's very difficult to make the numbers on these projects work.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10032)|
| 2:47:19| But if you can get a building that's not too far gone, which I don't think South High is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10039)|
| 2:47:24| you can get the historic preservation tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10044)|
| 2:47:26| Hopefully you can get TIF financing, which you seem to be talking about now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10046)|
| 2:47:30| And that can make a project squeak through the window of opportunity that it's needed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10050)|
| 2:47:36| And, you know, there were so many projects in this community that were too far gone, that were a blight,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10056)|
| 2:47:41| that people said, let's tear down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10061)|
| 2:47:43| I mean, many of you might remember the Bijou.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10063)|
| 2:47:45| It was an adult movie house in part-time parking area when it was saved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10065)|
| 2:47:50| So you need to be able to look longer term and see past the grime and the broken windows and, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10070)|
| 2:47:56| the pigeon dung and get into what's really valuable about a building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10076)|
| 2:48:00| The other lesson I talked about is patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10080)|
| 2:48:03| This has been really difficult for me, but I finally learned that preservation plants the seed for future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10083)|
| 2:48:11| It is a tool that is not immediate gratification, although I wish it was on a daily basis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10091)|
| 2:48:17| It takes time for projects to work out because they're difficult.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10097)|
| 2:48:21| I always say, if it ain't broke, I don't get to play with it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10101)|
| 2:48:24| You know, they only get to us when they're very difficult to pull off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10104)|
| 2:48:29| I would say that future development has been shown with preservation in the historic neighborhoods around downtown,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10109)|
| 2:48:35| in downtown, and that is starting to pay off for our community in many, many ways.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10115)|
| 2:48:40| Also, preservation can prime the market, prime the pump for the private market to come in and invest.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10120)|
| 2:48:47| That's been shown over and over again in downtown and communities all over Knox County.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10127)|
| 2:48:52| And this, when you're thinking about it, a lot of people are thinking of the up front on this building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10132)|
| 2:48:56| Believe me, if this building were valuable, somebody would have stepped up at the auction| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10136)|
| 2:49:00| when it was offered for a $25,000 minimum bid and no one stepped up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10140)|
| 2:49:05| I mean, this is like a pound puppy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10145)|
| 2:49:08| And almost in a case to adopt it and deal with the issues that it has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10148)|
| 2:49:12| And so what we are looking at here is long-term investing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10152)|
| 2:49:16| This is not short-term popping in and out of the market, getting a quick hit of profit for the county.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10156)|
| 2:49:21| This is long-term investing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10161)|
| 2:49:23| But that is what preservation is about, and that is wise investing for most people in this country.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10163)|
| 2:49:28| And I think it's a wise way to invest for Knox County in this case.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10168)|
| 2:49:32| Because it will be an asset to the community once it's stabilized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10172)|
| 2:49:36| When it's redeveloped, it will be an even greater asset| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10176)|
| 2:49:39| and will help stabilize values in that neighborhood and make it an attractive place that draws residents.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10179)|
| 2:49:45| But we come to a point when patience is important,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10185)|
| 2:49:48| but action is the only thing that saves important places that this community loves| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10188)|
| 2:49:52| and wants to use into its future for investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10192)|
| 2:49:56| And we need action from the commission to save this important community landmark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10196)|
| 2:50:00| We ask you to vote to sell the building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10200)|
| 2:50:03| I personally don't have a preference as to how you all want to work it out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10203)|
| 2:50:07| I mean, we've done two RFPs. We've done an auction.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10207)|
| 2:50:09| I've seen it all. I can handle it all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10209)|
| 2:50:12| But we need action.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10212)|
| 2:50:13| There are so many great ideas, and they might come to fruition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/cocom080428part1?start=10213)|
