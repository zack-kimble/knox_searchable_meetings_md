| 0:19:27| I moved here in September of 2021.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1167)|
| 0:19:31| You know, through my career of serving the military and federal law enforcement, one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1171)|
| 0:19:37| thing happened here tonight that I found, you know, interesting and refreshing was saying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1177)|
| 0:19:41| the Pledge of Allegiance which ends with, with liberty and justice for all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1181)|

| 0:20:01| Well, whenever I think about that, and then I think about, I believe it was the Dominion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1201)|
| 0:20:11| Group who had proposed a similar housing development over at Choteau Landing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1211)|
| 0:20:18| There's an article in the Knox newspaper dated September 14, 2023, where the residents| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1218)|

| 0:20:31| this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1231)|
| 0:20:32| Now, we don't have, you know, our little street doesn't have the number of residents that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1232)|
| 0:20:36| West Knoxville has.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1236)|
| 0:20:37| You know, we don't have the money that West Knoxville has, but regardless, the rule applies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1237)|

| 0:20:48| Now, personally, I'm not against the development, but I am against the fact of it's going to| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1248)|
| 0:20:55| increase the traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1255)|
| 0:20:56| It's going to be right against the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1256)|
| 0:20:59| And, you know, Ms. McKenzie was, you know, gracious enough to come spend some time with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1259)|
| 0:21:04| us recently and she saw the condition of the roads.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1264)|
| 0:21:07| She saw, you know, all the buses that come through that are empty.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1267)|
| 0:21:12| There's several aspects to this that it's just not, it's not a binary of yes or no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1272)|
| 0:21:18| So my request would be to postpone this and let the community get together with the church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1278)|
| 0:21:25| and with Golden Age to say, hey, this is what we're planning on doing, and how can we work| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1285)|
| 0:21:30| with the community, because truth be told, we weren't invited to a community meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1290)|
| 0:21:34| at the church until I made a comment on the planning commission website, and then things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1294)|
| 0:21:39| were dropped on our mailbox.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1299)|
| 0:21:41| So, you know, I'm not against it, but if I have to pick a binary, a yes or no, in its| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1301)|
| 0:21:48| current form, I am against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1308)|
| 0:21:50| Do I believe there is a need?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1310)|
| 0:21:51| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1311)|

| 0:21:57| But the way this is going, I'm not for it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1317)|
| 0:22:00| So in the comments that I did on the planning commission, I even drew a couple of rudimentary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1320)|
| 0:22:08| drawings for alternatives for, you know, doing the ingress and egress on Yellowstone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1328)|
| 0:22:14| which is currently a wider street than Beaman, as well as making the building an L-shape| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1334)|
| 0:22:20| that complements the existing L-shape building, so it's opposite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1340)|
| 0:22:25| But, you know, and I also offered to raise money to, you know, make the ingress and egress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1345)|
| 0:22:30| on Joy Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1350)|
| 0:22:31| So if you all were to ask, you know, to the church or to Golden Age, do you have any money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1351)|
| 0:22:38| for this project to increase the infrastructure?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1358)|
| 0:22:40| And that answer is going to be no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1360)|
| 0:22:41| So it's going to rely on us, yet the people that are asking to build this don't live on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1361)|
| 0:22:46| Beaman Lake Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1366)|
| 0:22:48| So I just request a postponed where we can all get together and reach an agreement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1368)|
| 0:22:54| Oh, because then also the way that the plans were shown to us, you know, I'd be sitting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1374)|
| 0:23:00| on my front porch, as would my neighbors, and being able to be looked at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1380)|
| 0:23:05| And, interesting, I know I've got a minute and 12 seconds left, but I got the request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1385)|
| 0:23:10| or the email about being able to speak.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1390)|
| 0:23:14| One of my neighbors did not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1394)|
| 0:23:15| He's here tonight, so I hope that you all will allow him because he didn't get the email.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1395)|
| 0:23:21| His name is Dennis and his wife, Karen, have lived on Beaman Lake Road for 63 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1401)|
| 0:23:27| So, anyway, that's all I have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1407)|
| 0:23:29| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1409)|
| 0:23:30| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1410)|
| 0:23:31| Next person who's signed up to speak in opposition to Item 12AB is Willie Crosby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1411)|
| 0:23:37| Mr. Crosby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1417)|
| 0:23:43| If you could start by stating your name and address for the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1423)|
| 0:23:45| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1425)|
| 0:23:46| My name is Willie Crosby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1426)|
| 0:23:47| I live at 1108 Beaman Lake Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1427)|
| 0:23:49| I've lived there for 40 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1429)|
| 0:23:51| No, 50 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1431)|
| 0:23:53| And I'm going to give a little history on this situation here, this piece of property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1433)|
| 0:23:58| We go back when Victor Ashe was mayor here in this town.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1438)|
| 0:24:03| The same piece of property wanted to build on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1443)|
| 0:24:07| Nothing's changed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1447)|
| 0:24:08| We're just rehashing the same thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1448)|
| 0:24:11| We're going back through the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1451)|
| 0:24:13| The road is not wide enough.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1453)|
| 0:24:15| We had it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1455)|
| 0:24:16| When I came before this body back then, the question was asked by a council person, Gene Tigg.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1456)|
| 0:24:25| Would you be willing to help pay widening the road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1465)|
| 0:24:28| Nope.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1468)|
| 0:24:29| We don't have the money for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1469)|
| 0:24:32| Roberts, another council person, he said, we need to look into this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1472)|
| 0:24:36| Even Victor Ashe, I saw him come up and down that road three or four times, Beaman Lake Road and that Buick.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1476)|
| 0:24:43| When he came before city council last time, last thing on the agenda, anybody in favor of doing this?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1483)|
| 0:24:53| It died for lack of motion for the simple reason, like Stephen said, I never have said I'm against it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1493)|
| 0:25:01| The road is just not wide enough to take care of the traffic that's going to be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1501)|
| 0:25:06| Now, Mr. Nash made a statement in the MPC meeting, oh, most of the traffic will be coming in from McDonnell Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1506)|
| 0:25:13| He can't prove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1513)|
| 0:25:14| He cannot prove it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1514)|
| 0:25:16| Not one iota.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1516)|
| 0:25:18| I've got a piece of paper here to tell you what I've done one Sunday on the 7th of last month.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1518)|
| 0:25:27| I sit in the ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1527)|
| 0:25:29| There's a ballpark there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1529)|
| 0:25:30| A lot of traffic comes from that right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1530)|
| 0:25:32| I sit in that ballpark there five minutes to one until 20 minutes to two and road north and south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1532)|
| 0:25:43| Fifty-two cars come through that road in that period of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1543)|
| 0:25:47| Twenty-three of them going south.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1547)|
| 0:25:50| Fourteen of them in this corner, one particular corner.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1550)|
| 0:25:53| Fourteen of them took theirs out of the middle, if you know what I mean, taking your cut out of the middle instead of on one side or the other.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1553)|
| 0:26:00| Going north, there was 29.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1560)|
| 0:26:03| Six of them took theirs out of the middle.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1563)|
| 0:26:07| In front of my house, just right there in my driveway, the city of Knoxville had to pay for one of the city vehicles.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1567)|
| 0:26:16| Messed up my driveway or road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1576)|
| 0:26:20| They come in, and you can go out there and look at it right now.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1580)|
| 0:26:22| You can tell the difference between the concrete where I poured and what the city done.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1582)|
| 0:26:27| And you don't have to take my word for nothing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1587)|
| 0:26:30| If this meeting is being recorded or has been recorded, go back and look at the minutes when Gene Tignum was in office and see what was said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1590)|
| 0:26:39| If I'm lying to you, the minutes will tell you, am I right or wrong.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1599)|
| 0:26:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1603)|
| 0:26:47| Council, that concludes the people who signed up to speak on Item 12AB.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1607)|
| 0:26:52| Questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1612)|
| 0:26:54| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1614)|
| 0:26:56| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1616)|
| 0:26:59| Isaac Thorne from CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1619)|
| 0:27:01| I'm not sure if Isaac is here or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1621)|
| 0:27:04| I did see him walk in.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1624)|
| 0:27:05| Mr. Thorne.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1625)|
| 0:27:06| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1626)|
| 0:27:07| If you could come to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1627)|
| 0:27:23| I think you have to give your name in it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1643)|
| 0:27:25| Isaac Thorne, Director of Knoxville Area Transit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1645)|
| 0:27:27| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1647)|
| 0:27:28| And so, Isaac, thank you for being here and thank you for returning my phone call.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1648)|
| 0:27:32| I know that we spoke briefly about the number of buses that are going through that Beeman Lake to Golden Age and maybe above.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1652)|
| 0:27:42| And thank you to the neighbors and to Stephen who organized that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1662)|
| 0:27:46| And we stood outside for about 45 minutes to an hour and just multiple buses coming through that did not have anyone on there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1666)|
| 0:27:54| And I think maybe one had one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1674)|
| 0:27:56| Could you share with everyone what you shared with me as it relates to what that schedule is going to look like moving forward?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1676)|
| 0:28:03| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1683)|
| 0:28:04| As Council may be aware, we're launching CAT Region Imagine on August 26th, which is a total redesign of our current bus routes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1684)|
| 0:28:11| We're proposing to only have one bus going through Golden Age in that area basically once an hour.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1691)|
| 0:28:16| So it won't be nearly as many buses going through that area starting on August 26th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1696)|
| 0:28:22| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1702)|
| 0:28:23| And that road absolutely has always been pretty narrow.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1703)|
| 0:28:28| When a bus comes, you have to make sure that either you're going to stop and at some juncture maybe go off the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1708)|
| 0:28:34| And so that's not a piece for you, though, unless someone else has a question for you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1714)|
| 0:28:38| I'll move on with my next question that's not related to CAT.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1718)|
| 0:28:43| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1723)|
| 0:28:45| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1725)|
| 0:28:46| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1726)|
| 0:28:47| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1727)|
| 0:28:49| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1729)|
| 0:28:50| Are there any improvements planned for Beeman Lake Road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1730)|
| 0:28:57| Mr. Clabo?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1737)|
| 0:29:01| Tom Clabo, Engineer Director.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1741)|
| 0:29:03| There's currently no improvements planned.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1743)|
| 0:29:05| Okay. Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1745)|
| 0:29:07| And was there a meeting with the neighborhood before this came to Council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1747)|
| 0:29:13| Council Member McKenzie, are you familiar?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1753)|
| 0:29:16| There was a meeting, and I don't know if Red Middlebrook or Avalon speak to that because I wasn't able to attend.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1756)|
| 0:29:24| Mr. Nance, could you share with Council any meetings you all had with the community?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1764)|
| 0:29:29| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1769)|
| 0:29:30| We held a community meeting at Canaan Baptist Church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1770)|
| 0:29:33| That meeting was held, I think we held it on the 8th, was it not?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1773)|
| 0:29:37| Yeah, we held it on the 8th.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1777)|
| 0:29:40| The flyers were distributed to the neighborhood to ask them to come in so we could present this project to the community and receive feedback.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1780)|
| 0:29:49| We received feedback and shared that information back to Red Middlebrook.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1789)|
| 0:29:55| Yep, the community, at least those two gentlemen right there, did express concerns about the road and the road width.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1795)|
| 0:30:03| So that was brought up at the community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1803)|
| 0:30:07| And just as a point of information, it did go through the Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1807)|
| 0:30:10| It was approved 10-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1810)|
| 0:30:13| Mike, I have similar concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1813)|
| 0:30:16| This is a project that we need, but I know that road well and for there to be 85 units,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1816)|
| 0:30:25| it seemed larger than other developments that we had passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1825)|
| 0:30:30| even though the Choteau project that was discussed earlier is in the county, so that didn't come before City Council for a vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1830)|
| 0:30:37| But we have had similar projects, and it seems like encouraging discussion with the community has allowed it to develop into something even better in many cases.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1837)|
| 0:30:51| So I was just really surprised by the number of 85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1851)|
| 0:30:56| Does anyone have an example of another similar project that we've supported that is this size on such a small neighborhood road?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1856)|
| 0:31:05| Councilwoman Parker, I would mention to you that this project is smaller than the Golden Age One project that currently exists.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1865)|
| 0:31:13| And I hear that, but we're adding to the road, right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1873)|
| 0:31:17| That project already exists on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1877)|
| 0:31:20| Now we're adding to it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1880)|
| 0:31:22| That's my only concern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1882)|
| 0:31:26| Thank you, Councilmember Ryder.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1886)|
| 0:31:28| Yeah, Mr. Nance, you're going to have to help me because I don't remember the street names,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1888)|
| 0:31:34| but I remember coming to a grand opening for one of, I think it's an LHP property up there on the backside of the ridge in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1894)|
| 0:31:44| Covenant Village.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1904)|
| 0:31:45| Yes, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1905)|
| 0:31:46| How many units are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1906)|
| 0:31:49| That is 185.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1909)|
| 0:31:53| Those are family-style units, so keep in mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1913)|
| 0:31:55| Those are family-style.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1915)|
| 0:31:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1916)|
| 0:31:57| And the units at this development, what are you proposing there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1917)|
| 0:32:01| Elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1921)|
| 0:32:02| Okay, so they're elderly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1922)|
| 0:32:03| They're going to be people that don't drive and don't have cars.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1923)|
| 0:32:07| Most will.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1927)|
| 0:32:08| I think that's part of the reason why the bus comes through there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1928)|
| 0:32:10| My stepdad just got his driver's license taken away because of dementia.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1930)|
| 0:32:16| I mean, it's a common thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1936)|
| 0:32:17| Lots of people lose their driver's licenses and not able to drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1937)|
| 0:32:21| So you might have a lesser percentage of number of people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1941)|
| 0:32:24| But the number of units you're proposing here for Beeman Drive are 70-something or 80?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1944)|
| 0:32:31| 85.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1951)|
| 0:32:32| 85 one-bedroom?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1952)|
| 0:32:33| No, there will be 73 one-bedrooms and 12 two-bedrooms.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1953)|
| 0:32:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1958)|
| 0:32:39| And then Councilwoman Parker asked if there's anything comparable in the units that you guys did there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1959)|
| 0:32:46| that you just mentioned up in Fountain City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1966)|
| 0:32:49| You said there's well over 100 units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1969)|
| 0:32:51| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1971)|
| 0:32:52| And many of those were two- and three-bedroom.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1972)|
| 0:32:54| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1974)|
| 0:32:55| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1975)|
| 0:32:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1976)|
| 0:32:57| I would say those roads are fairly comparable.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1977)|
| 0:32:58| Those are small roads up against the ridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1978)|
| 0:33:00| They are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1980)|
| 0:33:01| And those—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1981)|
| 0:33:02| With more traffic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1982)|
| 0:33:03| None of the complaints that I got about that particular development, and it's about twice as big.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1983)|
| 0:33:09| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1989)|
| 0:33:10| With two- and three-bedroom units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1990)|
| 0:33:12| None of those are one-bedroom, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1992)|
| 0:33:14| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1994)|
| 0:33:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1995)|
| 0:33:16| And it's marketed at families, has a playground, so most people drive, different demographic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=1996)|
| 0:33:23| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2003)|
| 0:33:24| Can you think of any others off the top of your head that I haven't thought of?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2004)|
| 0:33:29| That one just comes to mind because I've been there on the ground.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2009)|
| 0:33:32| Well, I mean, I think when we're talking about particularly elderly properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2012)|
| 0:33:36| I think if you look at a couple of elderly properties that we have developed at LHP,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2016)|
| 0:33:41| one being on the east side, which was formerly Town View Towers, is now 1100 Studio.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2021)|
| 0:33:46| The investment we made there, and I think it has improved the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2026)|
| 0:33:50| And then I know we met with Councilmember Roberto to present to him the plans that we were doing on Westview Towers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2030)|
| 0:33:59| the renovation work that we were doing at that particular location, which is also another elderly project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2039)|
| 0:34:06| You're accurate with regards to the driving and the amount of driving,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2046)|
| 0:34:10| but I think, again, there will be some residents there who will have cars, and we do know that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2050)|
| 0:34:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2058)|
| 0:34:19| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2059)|
| 0:34:20| Mr. Bentley, I see you in the back of the room, and I know this project isn't related to you,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2060)|
| 0:34:24| but may I ask you a question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2064)|
| 0:34:30| Could you tell me how many units are at Love Towers?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2070)|
| 0:34:37| Mr. Nance probably could have told you that, too, but 240.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2077)|
| 0:34:41| Oh, yeah, you're right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2081)|
| 0:34:42| I'm sorry about that, Mr. Nance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2082)|
| 0:34:43| You asked the right guy.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2083)|
| 0:34:44| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2084)|
| 0:34:45| He doesn't work there anymore.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2085)|
| 0:34:47| Okay, 240, and that's in the middle of a low-density, medium-density neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2087)|
| 0:34:54| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2094)|
| 0:34:55| What about KCDC has a property over near Morningside Park, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2095)|
| 0:35:00| Morningside Park.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2100)|
| 0:35:02| Isabella.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2102)|
| 0:35:03| Isabella is about 240.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2103)|
| 0:35:04| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2104)|
| 0:35:05| Northgate is 270, so it's in the neighborhood context.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2105)|
| 0:35:08| So there are several examples.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2108)|
| 0:35:10| Okay, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2110)|
| 0:35:11| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2111)|
| 0:35:12| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2112)|
| 0:35:13| And Summit Towers, I know that's not you guys' property, but do you know how many units are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2113)|
| 0:35:17| It's in the same ballpark.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2117)|
| 0:35:18| It's about 250, yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2118)|
| 0:35:20| Two-fifty units, and that's not particularly—it's not the same kind of road as Beeman Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2120)|
| 0:35:24| but it's certainly not super accessible where it's located.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2124)|
| 0:35:28| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2128)|
| 0:35:29| I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2129)|
| 0:35:30| Thank you for the comparables.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2130)|
| 0:35:31| Thank you, sir.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2131)|
| 0:35:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2132)|
| 0:35:33| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2133)|
| 0:35:34| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2134)|
| 0:35:35| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2135)|
| 0:35:36| So the one thing that I will say about Beeman Lake Road is even not so much when we talk| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2136)|
| 0:35:43| about additional traffic with—from the seniors, because even at Golden Age, there are not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2143)|
| 0:35:48| that many cars that are up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2148)|
| 0:35:50| So I understand the bus traffic, and I think maybe a lot of the seniors maybe get, you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2150)|
| 0:35:55| know, lift, CAC lift, and those types of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2155)|
| 0:35:58| But the cut through traffic is, to me, even a greater problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2158)|
| 0:36:02| The narrowness of that road and the drop-offs of that road, especially when you're talking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2162)|
| 0:36:08| about the CAT buses coming in, it is very difficult for a car to maneuver around that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2168)|
| 0:36:13| I know that's not your problem, but I do think that I'd like to see some further conversation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2173)|
| 0:36:20| around just the safety of it, because even just standing there, people just flying through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2180)|
| 0:36:24| and they always have, even so on the Yellowstone.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2184)|
| 0:36:29| And as you go further around Beeman Lake Road, the drop-offs could absolutely just—someone| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2189)|
| 0:36:38| could get hurt or killed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2198)|
| 0:36:39| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2199)|
| 0:36:40| And so I'm not certain if that is something that we can look at as it relates to these| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2200)|
| 0:36:47| properties that are being, you know, built, if that onus falls on a developer, if it's| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2207)|
| 0:36:53| something that the City, we need to maybe take a look at to do studies.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2213)|
| 0:36:58| Beeman Lake, there are a lot of Beeman Lake-sized roads across the City.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2218)|
| 0:37:02| I mean, and heaven forbid we talk about the County, but I've just, you know—and the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2222)|
| 0:37:07| houses are very close, the properties are very close, and there's ditches there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2227)|
| 0:37:11| So—| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2231)|
| 0:37:12| Council Member McKenzie, I'd be happy to have my staff take a look at that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2232)|
| 0:37:16| And, you know, just knowing that there's a lot of narrow streets that need traffic calming,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2236)|
| 0:37:23| and that might be one that is a higher priority as it gains more people.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2243)|
| 0:37:27| But we'll take a look at it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2247)|
| 0:37:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2249)|
| 0:37:30| And then also, let me end with, I have not seen development plans, and so as those are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2250)|
| 0:37:37| moving forward, I would like to recommend that there is a meeting, a community meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2257)|
| 0:37:44| that would allow those plans as they are designed to be able to be shared with the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2264)|
| 0:37:49| And let's sit back down at the table and talk more through those concerns that are| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2269)|
| 0:37:55| out there, and then maybe we have the City at the table as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2275)|
| 0:37:58| We're committed to that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2278)|
| 0:38:00| We're committed to that at the community meeting we held, that we would have regular| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2280)|
| 0:38:04| scheduled meetings to keep them up to date on the project and share with them information.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2284)|
| 0:38:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2289)|
| 0:38:10| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2290)|
| 0:38:11| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2291)|
| 0:38:13| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2293)|
| 0:38:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2296)|
| 0:38:19| I'm planning to support this project, even though I do have concerns, and I do encourage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2299)|
| 0:38:25| the conversations moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2305)|
| 0:38:27| I encourage the neighborhood to stay involved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2307)|
| 0:38:29| I have seen projects like this, even after we've approved a zoning change, still some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2309)|
| 0:38:39| changes made to try to accommodate some of the concerns raised by the neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2319)|
| 0:38:46| I hope those conversations do move forward, because I don't really think that the comparables| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2326)|
| 0:38:52| that were discussed were really good comparables for this road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2332)|
| 0:38:58| I think Council Member McKenzie just described it very well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2338)|
| 0:39:03| It is a cut-through road, and it's a very tiny road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2343)|
| 0:39:09| I'm concerned about the traffic that this new development could bring, more so from| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2349)|
| 0:39:15| visitors than necessarily those living there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2355)|
| 0:39:22| I'm going to support it, but I do believe there's still more work to do to ensure that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2362)|
| 0:39:28| we as a city are supporting the infrastructure needed for these new developments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2368)|
| 0:39:33| I will say, if we negotiate ahead of time, we can bring the developer in, share some| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2373)|
| 0:39:39| of those costs, but when we give them what they want, then we have to be willing to take| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2379)|
| 0:39:44| those costs on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2384)|
| 0:39:45| But we've got to have the infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2385)|
| 0:39:47| Don't say we haven't got the money for the infrastructure we need.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2387)|
| 0:39:50| That's all I've got.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2390)|
| 0:39:51| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2391)|
| 0:39:52| Council Member Fugate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2392)|
| 0:39:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2393)|
| 0:39:54| Mr. Nance, just don't go sit down.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2394)|
| 0:39:57| I have questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2397)|
| 0:39:58| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2398)|
| 0:39:59| I saw you making a move.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2399)|
| 0:40:03| Just a sequencing of this I think might be helpful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2403)|
| 0:40:08| You don't have the tax credits yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2408)|
| 0:40:11| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2411)|
| 0:40:12| Because you must have the zoning approved in order to request those so that they know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2412)|
| 0:40:19| the project could actually go forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2419)|
| 0:40:21| Am I correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2421)|
| 0:40:23| It's a little bit different from that in the sense that we cannot close on our financing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2423)|
| 0:40:29| We will not hear on the tax credits probably until around August, somewhere around August| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2429)|
| 0:40:34| before we even know if we've even been awarded funding to actually build the project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2434)|
| 0:40:38| And my next point about that is I suppose it's been my experience when I was in the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2438)|
| 0:40:46| business that oftentimes the rough design plans are not the final design plans because| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2446)|
| 0:40:54| one doesn't invest a whole lot of money in actual to scale renderings of things until| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2454)|
| 0:41:02| one knows that the project can go forward and financing is obtained.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2462)|
| 0:41:08| So I think it is just something to remember when all these things come to us that oftentimes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2468)|
| 0:41:14| the renderings we get shown may or may not be what it finally looks like.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2474)|
| 0:41:20| And that's why continuing the conversation with the neighborhood is so important in what| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2480)|
| 0:41:25| most developers now do because it makes for a much better project and community if the| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2485)|
| 0:41:34| project goes in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2494)|
| 0:41:35| So just kind of wanted to reiterate that it's not uncommon for conversations with developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2495)|
| 0:41:43| to continue much longer than after the zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2503)|
| 0:41:46| The zoning is just the first step that gives you incentive to go ahead and pursue the whole thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2506)|
| 0:41:53| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2513)|
| 0:41:54| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2514)|
| 0:41:55| Council Member Ryder and then Mackenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2515)|
| 0:41:57| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2517)|
| 0:41:58| Mr. Nance, I don't know if this is your question to ask or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2518)|
| 0:42:02| The first I have two questions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2522)|
| 0:42:04| The first question is there are no there are no drawings or anything in our packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2524)|
| 0:42:12| We are.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2532)|
| 0:42:13| We have not designed this project yet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2533)|
| 0:42:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2535)|
| 0:42:16| All we had was a site map that we used.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2536)|
| 0:42:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2538)|
| 0:42:19| So when you met with neighbors, when you talked about a site map, you just talked about like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2539)|
| 0:42:23| layout with squares of what it might be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2543)|
| 0:42:25| That's all we could show them was a site map.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2545)|
| 0:42:27| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2547)|
| 0:42:28| And we don't have that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2548)|
| 0:42:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2549)|
| 0:42:30| So there was a.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2550)|
| 0:42:31| Planning had that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2551)|
| 0:42:32| Oh, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2552)|
| 0:42:33| It's not in our packet or it's not in the agenda item I'm looking at, I guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2553)|
| 0:42:39| So one of the gentlemen brought up Joy Road versus Beeman Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2559)|
| 0:42:44| When you guys met and talked about that, you talked about the different possibilities of| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2564)|
| 0:42:49| the two different.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2569)|
| 0:42:51| That was raised at the community meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2571)|
| 0:42:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2573)|
| 0:42:54| So that leads me to my next question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2574)|
| 0:42:56| It looks like the Canaan Baptist Housing Corp owns that whole long stretch of road along| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2576)|
| 0:43:01| Yellowstone Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2581)|
| 0:43:03| But that's not part of this at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2583)|
| 0:43:06| Canaan Baptist Housing Corp is a part of this development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2586)|
| 0:43:09| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2589)|
| 0:43:10| But what about that parcel of land?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2590)|
| 0:43:12| Well, that parcel of land is on that backside as part of the city's hill slope protection| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2592)|
| 0:43:16| area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2596)|
| 0:43:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2597)|
| 0:43:18| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2598)|
| 0:43:19| So it's not part.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2599)|
| 0:43:20| It won't be included in any of your site plan, entrance, egress, any of that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2600)|
| 0:43:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2605)|
| 0:43:26| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2606)|
| 0:43:27| I just noted that it borders different streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2607)|
| 0:43:30| That's why I was asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2610)|
| 0:43:31| But it will be left as a buffer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2611)|
| 0:43:33| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2613)|
| 0:43:34| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2614)|
| 0:43:35| So it's like an undeveloped piece of hill protected area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2615)|
| 0:43:40| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2620)|
| 0:43:42| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2622)|
| 0:43:43| Council Member McKenzie.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2623)|
| 0:43:44| My last question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2624)|
| 0:43:45| My last comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2625)|
| 0:43:46| And so I just want to thank the community for inviting me out to meet with you guys| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2626)|
| 0:43:51| and hear your concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2631)|
| 0:43:53| And I kind of want to get a time frame of when you think that there may be some plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2633)|
| 0:44:01| or some drawings that we could actually have the next meeting to sit down and take a look| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2641)|
| 0:44:06| at that with community members?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2646)|
| 0:44:08| We will not have design drawings committed starting until after August.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2648)|
| 0:44:13| Once we're here, if we've got the tax credits, then we will commission those other expenses| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2653)|
| 0:44:18| on this project.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2658)|
| 0:44:20| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2660)|
| 0:44:21| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2661)|
| 0:44:22| So I'll be looking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2662)|
| 0:44:23| If you all will please keep me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2663)|
| 0:44:24| Later in the fall, we'll be getting back to the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2664)|
| 0:44:27| August, September, somewhere in there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2667)|
| 0:44:29| And let them know that we've been awarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2669)|
| 0:44:31| Definitely want to come back and let them know if we've been awarded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2671)|
| 0:44:34| But as we get our drawings developed, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2674)|
| 0:44:36| So you said if you've been awarded?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2676)|
| 0:44:39| There's tax credits.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2679)|
| 0:44:40| There's a low-income housing tax credit program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2680)|
| 0:44:42| It's a competitive program.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2682)|
| 0:44:43| So there is a possibility that potentially it could not end up in the city?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2683)|
| 0:44:46| We could not be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2686)|
| 0:44:47| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2687)|
| 0:44:48| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2688)|
| 0:44:49| But the road issue will still be there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2689)|
| 0:44:50| Will still be there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2690)|
| 0:44:51| So, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2691)|
| 0:44:52| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2692)|
| 0:44:53| Please keep me posted so I can make sure that I'm at that meeting as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2693)|
| 0:44:56| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2696)|
| 0:44:57| We'll do it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2697)|
| 0:44:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2698)|
| 0:44:59| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2699)|
| 0:45:00| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2700)|
| 0:45:01| I would like to call forward a member of the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2701)|
| 0:45:08| I'm sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2708)|
| 0:45:09| I cannot remember your name.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2709)|

| 0:45:12| Mr. Crosby.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2712)|
| 0:45:13| I'm understanding you're asking about the redesigning of the building| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2713)|
| 0:45:18| and all that stuff.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2718)|
| 0:45:19| But that has nothing to do with the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2719)|
| 0:45:21| I don't care what you do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2721)|
| 0:45:23| You can redesign a pup tent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2723)|
| 0:45:27| But it's not going to take care of the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2727)|
| 0:45:29| That's the problem.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2729)|
| 0:45:30| No one over there has never said, no, don't build it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2730)|
| 0:45:33| What we're saying is take our safety first.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2733)|
| 0:45:37| That's the only thing we're asking.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2737)|
| 0:45:40| Is that too much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2740)|
| 0:45:42| Is it really too much?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2742)|
| 0:45:45| Yeah, Mr. Crosby, as I mentioned when Mr. McKenzie asked about this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2745)|
| 0:45:49| if this moves forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2749)|
| 0:45:50| we will definitely reevaluate the needs for paving| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2750)|
| 0:45:53| and other repairs on that road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2753)|
| 0:45:56| But this juncture, it's a land use rezoning decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2756)|
| 0:45:59| and so we'll evaluate based on council's decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2759)|
| 0:46:04| Any other questions or comments by council?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2764)|
| 0:46:09| There is a motion, I think.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2769)|
| 0:46:11| Mr. Bishop, you haven't been recognized.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2771)|
| 0:46:13| If a council member has a question for you, they can call on you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2773)|
| 0:46:16| Ms. Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2776)|
| 0:46:18| Mr. Bishop.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2778)|
| 0:46:19| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2779)|
| 0:46:20| Did you have another comment to share?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2780)|
| 0:46:21| I do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2781)|
| 0:46:23| I guess my question is, program manager by trade,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2783)|
| 0:46:26| who owns the next actions, how are we advised?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2786)|
| 0:46:29| This is first reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2789)|
| 0:46:31| So if council approves this on first reading in two weeks,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2791)|
| 0:46:33| it will be second reading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2793)|
| 0:46:35| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2795)|
| 0:46:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2796)|

| 0:47:17| Mayor, I'd like to ask if we could amend this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2837)|
| 0:47:21| and approve both this item and the next item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2841)|
| 0:47:25| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2845)|
| 0:47:26| So you're making a motion to consider item 12AC and 12AD on the same vote?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2846)|

| 0:48:01| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2881)|
| 0:48:02| And now we'll go back to 10A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2882)|
| 0:48:06| 10A is an ordinance of the Council of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2886)|

| 0:48:15| by the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2895)|

| 0:48:27| an expansion of existing right turn lane| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2907)|

| 0:48:36| First District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2916)|
| 0:48:37| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2917)|
| 0:48:49| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2929)|
| 0:48:50| First up to speak in favor of this item, 10A, is Wayne Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2930)|
| 0:48:56| Mr. Klein, you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2936)|
| 0:49:00| If you could start by saying your name and address.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2940)|
| 0:49:02| My name is Wayne Klein.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2942)|
| 0:49:05| I'm an attorney for the Ungers, the Howards, and Mary Miller,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2945)|
| 0:49:09| who's representing her entire Anchorage subdivision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2949)|
| 0:49:13| My address is 445 South Gay Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2953)|
| 0:49:16| We're in the Miller building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2956)|
| 0:49:18| I'm an attorney at Hodges, Dowdy, and Carson.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2958)|
| 0:49:20| I got involved about two weeks and a half a day ago.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2960)|
| 0:49:26| Council Member Smith was kind enough to give us two weeks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2966)|
| 0:49:29| We have a lawsuit that was filed and then dismissed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2969)|
| 0:49:33| We have been talking, and we are now here before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2973)|
| 0:49:38| to talk about what we are going to do after tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2978)|
| 0:49:44| because much like the Beeman Lake Road property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2984)|
| 0:49:49| we expect that the Calvary Baptist Church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2989)|
| 0:49:53| or the Calvary Church, I think it is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2993)|
| 0:49:55| is going to proceed with its private way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=2995)|
| 0:50:00| but with conditions that we know that this body can't place on it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3000)|
| 0:50:05| but at the same time we want this body to know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3005)|
| 0:50:09| what a tumultuous ride it's been for these folks| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3009)|
| 0:50:12| and how discussions have ensued| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3012)|
| 0:50:15| and now put us in a position where we're working together and cooperatively.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3015)|
| 0:50:20| The lawsuit's been dismissed, and the parties are talking,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3020)|
| 0:50:27| and they're talking about an electronic gate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3027)|
| 0:50:31| at the end of the private way at Topside Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3031)|
| 0:50:36| and use for events, for the church events only,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3036)|
| 0:50:41| and not open on a 24-7 basis so it won't have a cut-through,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3041)|
| 0:50:47| and also two deputies on John Sevier Highway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3047)|
| 0:50:51| per traffic study mandate at church events| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3051)|
| 0:50:58| and the site distance being kept per traffic study| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3058)|
| 0:51:03| with vegetation cleared on the right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3063)|
| 0:51:06| and protecting Mr. Howard's property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3066)|
| 0:51:09| a landscape buffer using shade trees| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3069)|
| 0:51:12| for the Howard and the Unger properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3072)|
| 0:51:17| and these are things that Calvary and my clients are talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3077)|
| 0:51:25| and that's what this council is suggesting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3085)|
| 0:51:29| in the Beeman Lake Road property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3089)|
| 0:51:32| It's what we're intending to do,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3092)|
| 0:51:35| and we're here to talk about it tonight because we want it to be public.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3095)|
| 0:51:38| We want it to be before this body.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3098)|
| 0:51:42| The lighting we're talking about on the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3102)|
| 0:51:47| being directed downward with shorter luminaries| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3107)|
| 0:51:51| that will illuminate only the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3111)|
| 0:51:54| and not be casting light into these neighbors' property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3114)|
| 0:51:59| That's my clients.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3119)|
| 0:52:01| And these things are things that the church doesn't have to give us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3121)|
| 0:52:07| but they are,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3127)|
| 0:52:09| and we thank you for the opportunity of being before you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3129)|
| 0:52:12| and the process that brought us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3132)|
| 0:52:15| from the point of adversarialness to tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3135)|
| 0:52:19| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3139)|
| 0:52:21| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3141)|
| 0:52:23| Next person signed up to speak in favor of Item 10A is Tim Starkweather.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3143)|
| 0:52:29| Mr. Starkweather, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3149)|
| 0:52:34| No? Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3154)|
| 0:52:36| Next is Robert Unger.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3156)|
| 0:52:38| Robert Unger, are you present?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3158)|
| 0:52:41| I was speaking for Mr. Unger, too.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3161)|
| 0:52:43| Okay, but Mr. Starkweather is not present.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3163)|
| 0:52:46| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3166)|
| 0:52:47| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3167)|
| 0:52:48| Okay, we'll move on to people speaking up in opposition to Item 10A.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3168)|
| 0:52:53| First is Benjamin Mullins.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3173)|
| 0:52:55| Mr. Mullins, you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3175)|
| 0:52:59| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3179)|
| 0:53:00| Ben Mullins, 550 West Main Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3180)|
| 0:53:02| I represent Calvary Chapel of Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3182)|
| 0:53:05| the law firm of France McConnell and Seymour,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3185)|
| 0:53:08| and I do appreciate Mr. Kline's involvement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3188)|
| 0:53:12| Before we went to Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3192)|
| 0:53:14| the church did have a neighborhood meeting.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3194)|
| 0:53:16| There were some members of the neighborhood that didn't make that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3196)|
| 0:53:19| So during the Planning Commission discussion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3199)|
| 0:53:22| when special use was approved by Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3202)|
| 0:53:24| we committed to having a follow-up meeting with them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3204)|
| 0:53:27| We had difficulty scheduling that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3207)|
| 0:53:29| and so we asked for a postponement,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3209)|
| 0:53:31| and Mr. Smith was kind enough to give that to us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3211)|
| 0:53:34| so we could have a meeting,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3214)|
| 0:53:35| and Mr. Unger and Mr. Howard were there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3215)|
| 0:53:37| and Ms. Miller and other members of the community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3217)|
| 0:53:39| That was before Mr. Kline was engaged.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3219)|
| 0:53:41| And the things that Mr. Kline discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3221)|
| 0:53:44| were the things that we discussed with them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3224)|
| 0:53:47| that we were willing to look at and do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3227)|
| 0:53:50| The electronic gate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3230)|
| 0:53:53| the secondary access to Topside Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3233)|
| 0:53:56| along the old Masterson Road right-of-way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3236)|
| 0:53:58| that was closed back in 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3238)|
| 0:54:01| is going to serve as secondary access.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3241)|
| 0:54:04| That is something that we consulted with| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3244)|
| 0:54:07| the Knoxville Police Department,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3247)|
| 0:54:09| and they asked us to provide for that secondary access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3249)|
| 0:54:13| for emergency purposes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3253)|
| 0:54:15| We had a traffic impact analysis performed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3255)|
| 0:54:18| which recommended that we have this electronic gate,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3258)|
| 0:54:21| and we're willing to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3261)|
| 0:54:23| The only people that have access to the gate will be the staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3263)|
| 0:54:26| and it will be closed unless there's a major event.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3266)|
| 0:54:29| We have services on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3269)|
| 0:54:31| We have services on Wednesday night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3271)|
| 0:54:33| and services on Saturday night,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3273)|
| 0:54:35| and they'll likely be open so people can come in and out that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3275)|
| 0:54:38| But we still expect, and the traffic impact analysis supports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3278)|
| 0:54:41| that most of the traffic will come along John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3281)|
| 0:54:44| We already have two officers on John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3284)|
| 0:54:47| That's something we had committed to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3287)|
| 0:54:49| During COVID, we were having difficulty getting officers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3289)|
| 0:54:51| that could sign up and do that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3291)|
| 0:54:53| because they have to volunteer to do that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3293)|
| 0:54:55| But that's something that benefits us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3295)|
| 0:54:57| and that's what we want to do moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3297)|
| 0:54:59| We have talked about, you know, if people are turning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3299)|
| 0:55:02| especially left, onto the new access,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3302)|
| 0:55:06| entering the property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3306)|
| 0:55:08| headlights will be pointed towards Mr. Howard and Mr. Unger's home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3308)|
| 0:55:11| so we understand we'll have to have some landscaping there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3311)|
| 0:55:14| to shield them from the headlights,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3314)|
| 0:55:16| so that's not really an issue either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3316)|
| 0:55:18| As is the lighting on the road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3318)|
| 0:55:20| We can make it where the lighting on the road is only on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3320)|
| 0:55:22| when the gate is going to be open and it's going to be dark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3322)|
| 0:55:26| that's actually going to happen.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3326)|
| 0:55:28| And the lighting ordinance that the city has requires, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3328)|
| 0:55:32| shielded lighting that directs down towards the road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3332)|
| 0:55:35| and doesn't move away and cast light on the neighboring properties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3335)|
| 0:55:40| And we're willing to look at what's that going to look like| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3340)|
| 0:55:43| and make sure that the road is appropriately lit for safety reasons,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3343)|
| 0:55:46| but also being respectful to our neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3346)|
| 0:55:49| And those are things that we talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3349)|
| 0:55:51| during these neighborhood meetings| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3351)|
| 0:55:53| and those things that Mr. Klein and I have talked about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3353)|
| 0:55:55| that we are willing to do moving forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3355)|
| 0:56:00| We don't necessarily think they need to be conditions to the approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3360)|
| 0:56:05| We're going to be good neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3365)|
| 0:56:06| We're there, we're intending to expand.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3366)|
| 0:56:08| In fact, I think we have several members of the church here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3368)|
| 0:56:11| If you're in support of our application, would you please stand up?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3371)|
| 0:56:16| You know, right now, you know, we are going to,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3376)|
| 0:56:21| we do have plans to expand our congregation, our church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3381)|
| 0:56:26| That would have to go back through Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3386)|
| 0:56:30| and potentially City Council as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3390)|
| 0:56:33| Whenever we do something, we'll have to go back through the process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3393)|
| 0:56:36| So we have every intent to be good neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3396)|
| 0:56:38| and work with them through this process as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3398)|
| 0:56:41| And so, you know, we appreciate the dialogue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3401)|
| 0:56:45| We intend to keep that dialogue open as we move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3405)|
| 0:56:49| We're hoping, you know, that we can move forward in a way| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3409)|
| 0:56:53| that would encourage people to come to our church as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3413)|
| 0:56:56| So I would respectfully ask that you deny the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3416)|
| 0:57:04| and affirm the Planning Commission's decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3424)|
| 0:57:07| to approve the special use application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3427)|
| 0:57:09| which is just related to the access points| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3429)|
| 0:57:11| to Topside and John Sevier Highway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3431)|
| 0:57:14| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3434)|
| 0:57:16| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3436)|
| 0:57:17| Next person signed up to speak on opposition to 10A is Rob Landa.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3437)|
| 0:57:22| Rob Landa, if you could come to the podium, please.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3442)|
| 0:57:25| If you state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3445)|
| 0:57:27| and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3447)|

| 0:57:35| And I was actually asked to come and speak on behalf of Marcus Friedman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3455)|
| 0:57:40| who cannot be here tonight.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3460)|
| 0:57:42| He's prepared a statement for me to read,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3462)|
| 0:57:44| and I'd like to take Marcus's words and give them to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3464)|
| 0:57:50| My name is Marcus Friedman,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3470)|

| 0:57:55| I have attended Calvary Knoxville for over the last three and a half years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3475)|
| 0:58:00| I'm a retired deputy sheriff and U.S. soldier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3480)|
| 0:58:03| I spent 24 years in the Army, six years active duty,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3483)|
| 0:58:07| and 18 in the Reserves.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3487)|
| 0:58:11| I was a military policeman and CID agent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3491)|
| 0:58:14| I conducted countless dignitary protection details| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3494)|
| 0:58:17| and many physical security surveys.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3497)|
| 0:58:20| I was deployed overseas three different times.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3500)|
| 0:58:24| As a deputy sheriff, I worked for Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3504)|
| 0:58:27| for 28 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3507)|
| 0:58:30| My assignments included custody, patrol, a multi-agency auto theft,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3510)|
| 0:58:35| task detail, 11 years as a bomb technician,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3515)|

| 0:58:41| I also held a top-secret clearance| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3521)|
| 0:58:44| while working for a multi-agency FBI task force.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3524)|

| 0:58:52| and have also overseen emergency responses to the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3532)|
| 0:58:57| It's my professional opinion that the current ingress and egress plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3537)|
| 0:59:00| are insufficient.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3540)|
| 0:59:02| Our worship center seats 650 people,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3542)|
| 0:59:05| and we average 500 to 550 during each of our two services on Sunday.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3545)|
| 0:59:11| Between services, outgoing traffic almost always backs up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3551)|
| 0:59:14| from John Sevier Highway to near our parking areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3554)|
| 0:59:18| and simultaneously, a large number of vehicles| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3558)|
| 0:59:21| are entering the property for the next service.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3561)|
| 0:59:25| An emergency response by either law enforcement or EMS| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3565)|
| 0:59:28| would be very difficult or significantly delayed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3568)|
| 0:59:32| For an example, one evening after dark,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3572)|
| 0:59:35| one of our facilities team members was leaving the campus| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3575)|
| 0:59:38| only to find a person had parked their car| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3578)|
| 0:59:40| diagonally across our current driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3580)|
| 0:59:43| making it impossible to drive out.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3583)|
| 0:59:46| This person was later found to be mentally ill| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3586)|
| 0:59:49| and appeared to have no ill intent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3589)|
| 0:59:51| However, this incident underscores the need| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3591)|
| 0:59:54| for an additional driveway as ingress and egress.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3594)|
| 0:59:59| If an attack was planned and executed against Calvary Knoxville,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3599)|
| 1:00:03| the attacker or attackers could easily slow down| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3603)|
| 1:00:05| or prevent law enforcement or EMS response| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3605)|
| 1:00:08| by simply blocking the current driveway.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3608)|
| 1:00:13| Our current driveway is strongly encouraged to be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3613)|
| 1:00:20| It would provide additional ingress or egress| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3620)|
| 1:00:23| and would provide an additional response route| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3623)|
| 1:00:26| for emergency services.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3626)|
| 1:00:28| It's my opinion a new driveway exiting onto Topside Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3628)|
| 1:00:31| would not significantly increase traffic on Topside Road,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3631)|
| 1:00:35| would not affect nearby residents,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3635)|
| 1:00:37| and would only be used for short periods of time.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3637)|
| 1:00:43| An additional driveway would be very sufficient| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3643)|
| 1:00:47| and helpful for emergency responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3647)|
| 1:00:51| Just to piggyback on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3651)|
| 1:00:53| I also assist with serving in our safety ministry at the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3653)|
| 1:00:59| It's a beautiful, large campus, plenty of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3659)|
| 1:01:03| and it has seen growth in the past few years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3663)|
| 1:01:08| We're desperately in the need of another access point.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3668)|
| 1:01:12| And speaking from experience, response times, accessibility,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3672)|
| 1:01:16| tactical advantages are a priority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3676)|
| 1:01:19| and can be the difference between life and death| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3679)|
| 1:01:21| in a threatening situation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3681)|
| 1:01:23| So we just ask you to consider this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3683)|
| 1:01:26| We need this driveway, and we just ask for your grant on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3686)|
| 1:01:32| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3692)|
| 1:01:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3694)|
| 1:01:35| The last person signed up to speak in opposition for 10A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3695)|
| 1:01:38| is Mark Kirk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3698)|
| 1:01:40| If you could come to the podium, state your name and address| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3700)|
| 1:01:42| for the record, and you'll have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3702)|
| 1:01:44| Yes, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3704)|
| 1:01:45| I'm Mark Kirk, 3330 West Governor John Severe Highway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3705)|
| 1:01:48| and I'm the pastor of Calvary Chapel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3708)|
| 1:01:50| First of all, I want to say how blessed I am| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3710)|
| 1:01:52| to have gotten to meet some of our neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3712)|
| 1:01:54| over the last couple of months in person and by email,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3714)|
| 1:01:56| and I'm blessed to have called them friends.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3716)|
| 1:01:58| Secondly, I want to thank this commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3718)|
| 1:02:00| for the opportunity to share about our project| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3720)|
| 1:02:02| and my heart and a little history on the property as well,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3722)|
| 1:02:05| especially considering our desire for future development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3725)|
| 1:02:08| 21 years ago in 2003, as we were deciding whether or not| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3728)|
| 1:02:12| to purchase this 42-acre property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3732)|
| 1:02:14| it was determined by our board that we would first,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3734)|
| 1:02:17| before we move forward and make such a large investment,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3737)|
| 1:02:20| that we would first confirm with the city and the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3740)|
| 1:02:23| that we would be allowed to move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3743)|
| 1:02:25| and develop the property in line with our vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3745)|
| 1:02:28| Otherwise, we knew it would be unwise| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3748)|
| 1:02:30| to even purchase the property and even a foolish investment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3750)|
| 1:02:33| as well as bad stewardship with God's money.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3753)|
| 1:02:36| So first, we put together a long-term plan on paper| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3756)|
| 1:02:38| utilizing the land, the church buildings, green spaces,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3758)|
| 1:02:41| development, playgrounds, and knowing that at least| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3761)|
| 1:02:43| two entrances and exits would be necessary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3763)|
| 1:02:45| for this land to work for us.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3765)|
| 1:02:47| After putting together a general concept| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3767)|
| 1:02:49| and putting it on paper, we brought it before the MPC| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3769)|
| 1:02:52| to get approval before we began the venture.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3772)|
| 1:02:55| Then on January 6, 2004, a little over 20 years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3775)|
| 1:02:59| I stood before the MPC requesting permission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3779)|
| 1:03:02| to move forward with a full development plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3782)|
| 1:03:04| that we had submitted.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3784)|
| 1:03:06| And to my delight, on that day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3786)|
| 1:03:07| we received the city's recommendation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3787)|
| 1:03:09| and the MPC's complete and full approval to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3789)|
| 1:03:12| After years of extensive land development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3792)|
| 1:03:14| we finished our first building in 2013| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3794)|
| 1:03:16| and were well on our way to fulfilling our vision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3796)|
| 1:03:19| And about six or seven years ago,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3799)|
| 1:03:21| when we began moving forward on our pre-approved driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3801)|
| 1:03:24| we were suddenly and unexpectedly told| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3804)|
| 1:03:26| we could not move forward due to some complaints| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3806)|
| 1:03:28| and to move forward that we would now have to spend money| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3808)|
| 1:03:32| on extensive additional studies to be able to move forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3812)|
| 1:03:35| including an expensive traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3815)|
| 1:03:38| which we recently did.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3818)|
| 1:03:40| As you can imagine, this was quite a blow,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3820)|
| 1:03:42| having already done our due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3822)|
| 1:03:43| received approvals, waited many years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3823)|
| 1:03:45| and now spent millions of dollars on the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3825)|
| 1:03:48| And again, we wouldn't even have purchased the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3828)|
| 1:03:51| had we not come first to the MPC and the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3831)|
| 1:03:53| because we knew that would be unwise.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3833)|
| 1:03:56| Hence, I simply want to make it appeal to this committee| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3836)|
| 1:03:58| that you would not only approve our driveway,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3838)|
| 1:04:00| but allow us to complete our future land development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3840)|
| 1:04:02| based on the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3842)|
| 1:04:04| First, our planning ahead, our due diligence,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3844)|
| 1:04:06| after three meetings with the neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3846)|
| 1:04:08| as well as MPC 20 years ago| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3848)|
| 1:04:10| and receiving approval for land development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3850)|
| 1:04:13| Secondly, based on city and MPC approval,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3853)|
| 1:04:16| we move forward and have already now invested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3856)|
| 1:04:18| millions of dollars in this 42-acre property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3858)|
| 1:04:21| with infrastructure, buildings, and parking lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3861)|
| 1:04:24| And so with that said, I would simply ask| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3864)|
| 1:04:27| that the city council would allow us to move forward.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3867)|
| 1:04:29| I know I gave some history there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3869)|
| 1:04:30| but I thought it was important that you know| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3870)|
| 1:04:32| what we've been through over the last 20 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3872)|
| 1:04:34| and what brought us to this moment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3874)|
| 1:04:36| So I want to thank you very much for your time| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3876)|
| 1:04:38| and your attention and your consideration.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3878)|
| 1:04:42| Thank you very much, Pastor Kirk.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3882)|
| 1:04:45| Mr. Kline, you have an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3885)|
| 1:04:48| for up to a two-minute rebuttal if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3888)|
| 1:04:54| My clients, two of them, the Ungers and the Howards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3894)|
| 1:04:58| didn't get notice of Masterson Road closure in 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3898)|
| 1:05:02| when it happened and they just recently learned about it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3902)|
| 1:05:06| This was a surprise to them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3906)|
| 1:05:08| because they've lived there longer than Calvary's been there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3908)|
| 1:05:11| And so everybody's been surprised.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3911)|
| 1:05:14| And what we're trying to do is turn this thing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3914)|
| 1:05:18| into a good neighborhood where people can work together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3918)|
| 1:05:21| and still realize their peaceful| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3921)|
| 1:05:24| and residential objectives and goals| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3924)|
| 1:05:28| while at the same time Calvary can build| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3928)|
| 1:05:30| what they need to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3930)|
| 1:05:32| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3932)|
| 1:05:34| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3934)|
| 1:05:35| Law Director has a question for you, Mr. Kline,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3935)|
| 1:05:37| if you wouldn't mind.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3937)|
| 1:05:39| If you would come back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3939)|
| 1:05:41| As you know, this is an appeal of a special use application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3941)|
| 1:05:46| for a new driveway and the expansion of a turn lane.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3946)|
| 1:05:49| And it sounds like, from listening to what you said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3949)|
| 1:05:53| the parties have gathered together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3953)|
| 1:05:56| and entered into some agreements about some limitations on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3956)|
| 1:06:00| which would include the cross arm and the lighting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3960)|
| 1:06:05| and various and sundry other things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3965)|
| 1:06:08| But you understand that this council doesn't have the authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3968)|
| 1:06:12| to impose those requirements on this particular appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3972)|
| 1:06:16| You understand that that's going to be an agreement| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3976)|
| 1:06:18| between the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3978)|
| 1:06:20| It will have to be enforced by the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3980)|
| 1:06:23| So I guess what I'm trying to understand is,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3983)|
| 1:06:27| from your remarks, it sounded as though| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3987)|
| 1:06:30| you do not wish to press your appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3990)|
| 1:06:32| because you've reached this agreement with the property owners.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3992)|
| 1:06:36| And I'm trying to figure out whether that's the case or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3996)|
| 1:06:39| It's not that we're not pressing the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=3999)|
| 1:06:42| It's just that we know from the law and from the regulations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4002)|
| 1:06:47| that this body cannot impose conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4007)|
| 1:06:50| that I've just talked about that these parties have arrived at.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4010)|
| 1:06:54| So the appeal was to bring forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4014)|
| 1:06:57| that the neighborhood didn't understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4017)|
| 1:07:00| that the road had been closed, didn't have notice,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4020)|
| 1:07:03| and there were property issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4023)|
| 1:07:06| associated with adjacent property next to the Old Masterson Road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4026)|
| 1:07:10| Mr. Unger bought his property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4030)|
| 1:07:13| with the notion that he could access| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4033)|
| 1:07:17| the Old Masterson Road for ingress and egress to Topside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4037)|
| 1:07:21| That was 2012.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4041)|
| 1:07:24| Now the church owns the property under Old Masterson Road| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4044)|
| 1:07:29| and has the right to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4049)|
| 1:07:32| Does Mr. Unger have the right to access their property?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4052)|
| 1:07:37| That's a legal question that is not before this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4057)|
| 1:07:42| because it's not for this body to decide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4062)|
| 1:07:44| And so there are many other issues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4064)|
| 1:07:47| that have come before me and my representation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4067)|
| 1:07:51| that we've dealt with,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4071)|
| 1:07:53| and I've tried to explain to this body| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4073)|
| 1:07:55| how we're working together| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4075)|
| 1:07:57| to hopefully allow the church to do what it wants to do| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4077)|
| 1:08:01| with agreements that will protect and preserve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4081)|
| 1:08:05| the residential aspect of their neighbors.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4085)|
| 1:08:08| So are you asking the council members tonight| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4088)|
| 1:08:11| to vote to deny the special use application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4091)|
| 1:08:14| for the new driveway and the turn lane?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4094)|
| 1:08:16| We are asking this body to exercise its authority| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4096)|
| 1:08:23| to place or approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4103)|
| 1:08:29| whatever conditions it can on this process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4109)|
| 1:08:33| so that the church can move forward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4113)|
| 1:08:36| without withdrawing the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4116)|
| 1:08:40| With regard to this appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4120)|
| 1:08:42| council members have limited options.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4122)|
| 1:08:45| Their options are to either approve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4125)|
| 1:08:47| the special use application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4127)|
| 1:08:49| or to deny the special use application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4129)|
| 1:08:53| It is not to impose the kinds of limitations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4133)|
| 1:08:58| that you referred to.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4138)|
| 1:09:00| That will have to be an agreement between the parties.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4140)|
| 1:09:02| So based on that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4142)|
| 1:09:04| are you asking them to deny the special use application?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4144)|
| 1:09:08| The appeal is asking them to deny,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4148)|
| 1:09:10| and so I'm here on behalf of the appellants.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4150)|
| 1:09:14| I'm not sure you're answering the question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4154)|
| 1:09:16| Mr. Swanson, Mr. Frost had a question.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4156)|
| 1:09:19| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4159)|
| 1:09:25| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4165)|
| 1:09:26| I think Mr. Mullins was hitting on it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4166)|
| 1:09:28| or dancing around it earlier.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4168)|
| 1:09:30| 16.2G, Mr. Mullins,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4170)|
| 1:09:38| any modifications to a previously approved special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4178)|
| 1:09:42| must be resubmitted as a new special use application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4182)|
| 1:09:45| Is that what you're referring to, sir?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4185)|
| 1:09:47| I think so, yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4187)|
| 1:09:48| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4188)|
| 1:09:49| That's 16.2G.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4189)|
| 1:09:52| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4192)|
| 1:09:54| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4194)|
| 1:09:56| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4196)|
| 1:09:58| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4198)|
| 1:10:00| The church has, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4200)|
| 1:10:02| I appreciate the pastor laying out the history.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4202)|
| 1:10:04| I think that's important context to have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4204)|
| 1:10:06| because growth of any property or any development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4206)|
| 1:10:11| or any business is not linear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4211)|
| 1:10:13| and processes don't necessarily align so straightforward| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4213)|
| 1:10:16| so that you can predict the future| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4216)|
| 1:10:18| and different phases of the development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4218)|
| 1:10:20| I think planning got this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4220)|
| 1:10:22| I think planning commission got it right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4222)|
| 1:10:24| I don't plan to support the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4224)|
| 1:10:26| I read the traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4226)|
| 1:10:28| As growth happens,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4228)|
| 1:10:30| the neighborhood is right to be concerned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4230)|
| 1:10:32| with the unintended consequences,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4232)|
| 1:10:36| but I think a lot of, in the traffic study,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4236)|
| 1:10:38| there are a number of mitigations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4238)|
| 1:10:40| that have been agreed upon already by the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4240)|
| 1:10:42| and I think that those are going to be very impactful.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4242)|
| 1:10:44| I think the two exits,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4244)|
| 1:10:46| not just for the church member's safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4246)|
| 1:10:48| but for generally the community's safety,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4248)|
| 1:10:50| I think will increase the traffic safety| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4250)|
| 1:10:52| and the general movement around the property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4252)|
| 1:10:55| So I'm going to move to deny the appeal in just a minute,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4255)|
| 1:10:58| but I do think when appeals happen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4258)|
| 1:11:01| council members can't necessarily attend these discussions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4261)|
| 1:11:04| so far be it for me to add another cook to the kitchen,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4264)|
| 1:11:08| but if you want a third party,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4268)|
| 1:11:09| after this can participate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4269)|
| 1:11:11| in whatever subsequent conversations you have.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4271)|
| 1:11:14| I do think both parties are leaning in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4274)|
| 1:11:16| to make sure that they are good neighbors,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4276)|
| 1:11:18| and I think we beat around the bush enough to say| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4278)|
| 1:11:21| everybody's talking, everybody's trying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4281)|
| 1:11:24| and I think that there's room for cooperation after this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4284)|
| 1:11:29| I do have a question for Director Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4289)|
| 1:11:32| This is an appeal of a special use application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4292)|
| 1:11:35| but back to the original special use application.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4295)|
| 1:11:38| Because it is such, any subsequent changes to the property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4298)|
| 1:11:42| or any new development, substantial development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4302)|
| 1:11:45| would require a special use application by the church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4305)|
| 1:11:49| So if they wanted to build more than they have already| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4309)|
| 1:11:52| or wanted to or make substantial property changes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4312)|
| 1:11:55| special use processes require them| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4315)|
| 1:11:57| to come before a planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4317)|
| 1:11:59| and therefore invite the public back for more input.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4319)|
| 1:12:02| Is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4322)|
| 1:12:03| Yes, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4323)|
| 1:12:04| Amy Brooks, Knox-Moss County Planning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4324)|
| 1:12:06| Yes, as Mr. Frost just mentioned,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4326)|
| 1:12:08| Article 16.2G is the section that would guide this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4328)|
| 1:12:13| So since it is a previously approved planned district,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4333)|
| 1:12:15| any changes would have to go through that special use process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4335)|
| 1:12:17| Okay, thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4337)|
| 1:12:18| So just generally speaking for the church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4338)|
| 1:12:20| it is sometimes painful, laborious, expensive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4340)|
| 1:12:24| but every substantial change to this property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4344)|
| 1:12:28| requires public input as part of the special use process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4348)|
| 1:12:31| So you are going to have to work together after this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4351)|
| 1:12:34| and the next time, and the next expansion,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4354)|
| 1:12:36| and the next expansion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4356)|
| 1:12:37| So I don't imagine any of you neighbors are going anywhere,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4357)|
| 1:12:40| so keep working together.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4360)|
| 1:12:42| I think a lot of the suggestions by Mr. Klein,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4362)|
| 1:12:45| although we are not able to bolt onto this today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4365)|
| 1:12:48| I think are reasonable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4368)|
| 1:12:49| and I encourage the church to accommodate their neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4369)|
| 1:12:52| as much as possible,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4372)|
| 1:12:53| even beyond what is required in the traffic study.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4373)|
| 1:12:56| So I will pause for a second for any of my colleagues| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4376)|
| 1:12:59| that have any questions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4379)|
| 1:13:00| but I will be voting to deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4380)|
| 1:13:04| Thank you, Vice Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4384)|
| 1:13:05| Council Member Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4385)|
| 1:13:08| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4388)|
| 1:13:09| I wanted to clarify the issue around conditions,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4389)|
| 1:13:12| because we certainly had items come before us with conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4392)|
| 1:13:17| that we have approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4397)|
| 1:13:19| To clarify, and adding on to what Mr. Frost said,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4399)|
| 1:13:25| those discussions would need to take place during,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4405)|
| 1:13:30| not through an appeal process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4410)|
| 1:13:32| but through that special use review process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4412)|
| 1:13:37| Planning Commission could have attached some conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4417)|
| 1:13:39| and sent it to us?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4419)|
| 1:13:41| That's partly correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4421)|
| 1:13:43| There are some conditions that the council can order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4423)|
| 1:13:46| with regard to things that are going on with rezonings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4426)|
| 1:13:51| Things like having two deputies on site,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4431)|
| 1:13:53| that's not the kind of thing that we can order.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4433)|
| 1:13:56| Things like having a crossbar that certain people can get in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4436)|
| 1:13:59| and certain people can't get in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4439)|
| 1:14:01| that's not the kind of thing that you can order| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4441)|
| 1:14:03| as a part of this process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4443)|
| 1:14:06| It depends on what is being requested| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4446)|
| 1:14:09| in terms of a special condition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4449)|
| 1:14:12| The conditions that have been discussed are not conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4452)|
| 1:14:15| that would be conditions that the city could enforce.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4455)|
| 1:14:19| If the city can't enforce them, we can't require them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4459)|
| 1:14:23| Thank you for that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4463)|
| 1:14:25| Any other questions?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4465)|
| 1:14:27| Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4467)|
| 1:14:28| I'll just make the official motion to deny the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4468)|
| 1:14:32| Okay, motion has been made to deny the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4472)|
| 1:14:34| has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4474)|
| 1:14:35| Any further, Council Member McKenzie,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4475)|
| 1:14:38| any further questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4478)|
| 1:14:41| Seeing none, all those in favor of denying the appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4481)|
| 1:14:44| please say aye.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4484)|
| 1:14:46| Any opposed?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4486)|
| 1:14:48| The motion to deny carries.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4488)|
| 1:14:51| All right, we'll move on to the next item, 10B.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4491)|
| 1:14:55| 10B is a resolution of the Council of the City of Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4495)|
| 1:14:57| approving an appeal by West Hills Community Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4497)|
| 1:15:00| thereby overturning the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4500)|
| 1:15:02| of the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4502)|
| 1:15:04| to grant a special use application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4504)|
| 1:15:06| filed by Maple Lane Homes, LLC,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4506)|
| 1:15:09| for a two-family dwelling in an R&1 district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4509)|
| 1:15:12| for property located at 0 Westridge Drive, 2nd District.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4512)|
| 1:15:18| Okay, the first, we have three people signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4518)|
| 1:15:22| in favor of this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4522)|
| 1:15:24| First is Matt Davis.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4524)|
| 1:15:26| Mr. Davis, if you could come to the podium| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4526)|
| 1:15:30| and state your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4530)|
| 1:15:32| and you'll have up to five minutes to address Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4532)|
| 1:15:39| My name is Matt Davis, 7405 Westridge Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4539)|
| 1:15:45| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37909.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4545)|
| 1:15:49| I am here today with several of my neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4549)|
| 1:15:52| to ask City Council to approve this appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4552)|
| 1:15:55| and overturn the decision| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4555)|
| 1:15:57| made by the Knox County Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4557)|
| 1:16:00| which at the February 8th meeting| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4560)|
| 1:16:02| approved the special use request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4562)|
| 1:16:05| to build a duplex in the R&1 zoning district| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4565)|
| 1:16:08| on Westridge Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4568)|
| 1:16:11| The City of Knoxville's 2023 one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4571)|
| 1:16:15| on pages 27 and 28 contains location criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4575)|
| 1:16:20| for specific uses, including duplexes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4580)|
| 1:16:23| which states the following.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4583)|
| 1:16:25| Section A, duplexes may be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4585)|
| 1:16:28| in low-density areas where their development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4588)|
| 1:16:30| will not significantly affect the service demands| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4590)|
| 1:16:34| or aesthetics of the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4594)|
| 1:16:36| Within areas designated for low-density areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4596)|
| 1:16:40| designated for low-density residential use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4600)|
| 1:16:43| duplexes should be allowed where one or more| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4603)|
| 1:16:46| of the following conditions exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4606)|
| 1:16:49| Number one, the proposed site is located| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4609)|
| 1:16:52| on a collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4612)|
| 1:16:55| No, Westridge is a local street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4615)|
| 1:16:59| Number two, development of the duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4619)|
| 1:17:01| would provide a desirable buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4621)|
| 1:17:04| between residential and non-residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4624)|
| 1:17:07| This is not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4627)|
| 1:17:09| Number three, the site is in an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4629)|
| 1:17:12| having a gross density exceeding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4632)|
| 1:17:14| five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4634)|
| 1:17:17| No, none of the properties on Westridge| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4637)|
| 1:17:20| have densities greater than five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4640)|
| 1:17:25| Number four, the site is in an area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4645)|
| 1:17:27| which has experienced a significant loss of housing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4647)|
| 1:17:30| but is still desirable for residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4650)|
| 1:17:34| This is not true either.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4654)|
| 1:17:37| Number five, the site is part| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4657)|
| 1:17:39| of a planned residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4659)|
| 1:17:42| This is also not true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4662)|
| 1:17:44| And then lastly, number six,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4664)|
| 1:17:46| conversion of a detached house into a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4666)|
| 1:17:50| should be permitted where the structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4670)|
| 1:17:52| meets the location criteria listed above| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4672)|
| 1:17:55| and does not require significant variances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4675)|
| 1:17:58| from the provisions of the zoning ordinance.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4678)|
| 1:18:01| This is also untrue because this property is vacant land.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4681)|
| 1:18:05| Additional criteria in the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4685)|
| 1:18:09| section B, duplexes should be encouraged| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4689)|
| 1:18:12| in areas designated as appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4692)|
| 1:18:14| for medium-density housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4694)|
| 1:18:16| Again, this area is low-density residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4696)|
| 1:18:21| In section C, duplexes may be used in some instances| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4701)|
| 1:18:25| as buffers between detached housing areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4705)|
| 1:18:28| and more intense non-residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4708)|
| 1:18:32| The only non-residential use in the area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4712)|
| 1:18:34| is a church near this location.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4714)|
| 1:18:37| Lastly, the special use report by Knox Planning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4717)|
| 1:18:42| only mentions the first sentence of section A| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4722)|
| 1:18:47| and does not continue to address the six conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4727)|
| 1:18:50| that I just listed to you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4730)|
| 1:18:53| None of those six conditions have been met| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4733)|
| 1:18:57| and hence why this decision was appealed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4737)|
| 1:19:01| I'm asking this council to please approve this appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4741)|
| 1:19:04| in accordance with the law in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4744)|
| 1:19:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4747)|
| 1:19:10| Thank you. The next person signed up to speak| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4750)|
| 1:19:12| in favor of item 10B is Dale Brotherton.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4752)|
| 1:19:16| Mr. Brotherton, if you could come to the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4756)|
| 1:19:18| state your name and address for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4758)|
| 1:19:20| and you'll have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4760)|

| 1:19:43| I'm going to pick up where he left off.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4783)|
| 1:19:46| The Knoxville Zoning Ordinance, section 16-2F,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4786)|
| 1:19:50| deals with special use review standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4790)|
| 1:19:53| F1 states each special use must be evaluated| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4793)|
| 1:19:57| on an individual basis in relation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4797)|
| 1:20:00| to all applicable standards of this code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4800)|
| 1:20:04| Such evaluation will determine whether approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4804)|
| 1:20:08| of the special use is appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4808)|
| 1:20:10| at the particular location| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4810)|
| 1:20:13| and in the particular manner proposed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4813)|
| 1:20:17| The proposed special use must meet all| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4817)|
| 1:20:20| of the following criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4820)|
| 1:20:22| which Knoxville-Knox County Planning will support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4822)|
| 1:20:25| with documented findings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4825)|
| 1:20:29| F2 states the Knoxville-Knox County Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4829)|
| 1:20:33| and the exercise of its administrative judgment| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4833)|
| 1:20:37| will be guided by adopted plans and policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4837)|
| 1:20:40| including the general plan and the one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4840)|
| 1:20:45| and by the following general standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4845)|
| 1:20:49| Standards A and C are the most important for this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4849)|
| 1:20:54| Standard 2A, the use is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4854)|
| 1:20:59| with adopted plans and policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4859)|
| 1:21:01| including the general plan and the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4861)|
| 1:21:04| As was mentioned, the one-year plan includes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4864)|
| 1:21:07| the location criteria, which have not been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4867)|
| 1:21:12| These location criteria are not even mentioned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4872)|
| 1:21:15| in the special use report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4875)|
| 1:21:17| and were not discussed by Planning Commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4877)|
| 1:21:21| Standard 2C, the use is compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4881)|
| 1:21:25| with the character of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4885)|
| 1:21:28| which is proposed, and with the size| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4888)|
| 1:21:31| and location of the buildings in the vicinity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4891)|
| 1:21:35| The special use report states,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4895)|
| 1:21:37| although there are not duplexes in close proximity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4897)|
| 1:21:41| to the subject property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4901)|
| 1:21:43| the proposed use is compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4903)|
| 1:21:45| with the nearby single-family dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4905)|
| 1:21:48| This conclusion would suggest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4908)|
| 1:21:50| that all duplexes are compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4910)|
| 1:21:52| with nearby single-family dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4912)|
| 1:21:55| A duplex surrounded by single-family homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4915)|
| 1:21:58| is not compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4918)|
| 1:22:00| The special use report concludes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4920)|
| 1:22:02| if a proposed roof has similarities| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4922)|
| 1:22:05| to roofs down the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4925)|
| 1:22:07| that makes it compatible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4927)|
| 1:22:12| The picture of the proposed duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4932)|
| 1:22:16| included in the case file| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4936)|
| 1:22:18| and in the email I sent each of you last night| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4938)|
| 1:22:22| would offer proof that duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4942)|
| 1:22:25| would not be compatible, this duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4945)|
| 1:22:29| In addition, the road frontage| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4949)|
| 1:22:31| for this particular lot is only 80 feet wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4951)|
| 1:22:35| one of the smallest in the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4955)|
| 1:22:37| This would not be able to support| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4957)|
| 1:22:40| a 60-foot-wide, two-unit structure| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4960)|
| 1:22:43| with three bedrooms each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4963)|
| 1:22:46| and still be compatible| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4966)|
| 1:22:48| with smaller single-family homes on larger lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4968)|
| 1:22:54| Because all of the criteria have not been met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4974)|
| 1:22:57| the special use must be denied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4977)|
| 1:22:59| and the appeal approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4979)|
| 1:23:05| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4985)|
| 1:23:07| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4987)|
| 1:23:09| Last person signed up to speak in favor of item 10B| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4989)|
| 1:23:12| is Leland Hume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4992)|
| 1:23:14| Mr. Hume, you have up to five minutes to address council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=4994)|
| 1:23:28| Good evening again.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5008)|
| 1:23:30| My name is Lee Hume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5010)|
| 1:23:31| I live at 6902 Haverhill Drive in West Hills.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5011)|
| 1:23:35| I've been a resident at that location now for 37 years.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5015)|
| 1:23:40| And I also currently am serving as president| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5020)|
| 1:23:42| of the West Hills Community Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5022)|
| 1:23:44| who has brought this appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5024)|
| 1:23:48| for the special use application| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5028)|
| 1:23:50| that was approved by the county commission.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5030)|
| 1:23:56| You've heard from Dale and Matt| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5036)|
| 1:23:58| as far as the legal perspective on this issue.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5038)|
| 1:24:02| Very valid, definitely weighs on your final decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5042)|
| 1:24:08| It should be based on law and fact.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5048)|
| 1:24:11| One of the things that I was disappointed in| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5051)|
| 1:24:13| when I was going through and doing research| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5053)|
| 1:24:16| on this situation was that I don't think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5056)|
| 1:24:20| that either the community or the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5060)|
| 1:24:24| were well served by the report that was given| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5064)|
| 1:24:29| and that the county commissioners,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5069)|
| 1:24:31| planning commissioners, excuse me, were reviewing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5071)|
| 1:24:36| Because we do think that, and as Matt and Dale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5076)|
| 1:24:39| have pointed out, there are inconsistencies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5079)|
| 1:24:41| and things that were reported as being accurate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5081)|
| 1:24:44| that really aren't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5084)|
| 1:24:48| The other thing, the reason why I'm here too| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5088)|
| 1:24:51| and West Hills took on this particular case| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5091)|
| 1:24:56| is that we are a large community, well established,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5096)|
| 1:25:01| considered to be, many others other than us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5101)|
| 1:25:05| who live there, to be a very attractive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5105)|
| 1:25:08| desirable neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5108)|
| 1:25:10| We have a good school.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5110)|
| 1:25:11| We have low crime.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5111)|
| 1:25:13| We have conveniences.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5113)|
| 1:25:14| We have things that make it very attractive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5114)|
| 1:25:17| which I'm sure attracted the current owner| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5117)|
| 1:25:21| of the property and seeing an opportunity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5121)|
| 1:25:25| for a rare piece of a vacant lot in West Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5125)|
| 1:25:29| to build a property that obviously would be,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5129)|
| 1:25:33| as soon as it came on the market,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5133)|
| 1:25:35| I'm sure it would be taken up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5135)|
| 1:25:37| The problem, though, that we have as a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5137)|
| 1:25:40| West Hills is predominantly, in a big, big way,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5140)|
| 1:25:44| with 1,400 homes, most of the homes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5144)|
| 1:25:47| are single family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5147)|
| 1:25:49| I think the terminology architecturally| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5149)|
| 1:25:52| is that it's mid-century modern.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5152)|
| 1:25:55| It was one of the first, it actually was| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5155)|
| 1:25:57| the first subdivision in Knoxville post-World War II.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5157)|
| 1:26:02| And ever since it started, everybody realized| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5162)|
| 1:26:06| what an attractive area it was,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5166)|
| 1:26:07| including some folks and developers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5167)|
| 1:26:10| that were interested in trying to do things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5170)|
| 1:26:12| that were really contrary to what was trying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5172)|
| 1:26:15| to be built as a great neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5175)|
| 1:26:17| of single family residences, and that tradition lives on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5177)|
| 1:26:21| That's why the West Hills Community Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5181)|
| 1:26:23| was formed 60 years ago, and we're celebrating| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5183)|
| 1:26:25| that anniversary this year.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5185)|
| 1:26:27| But what I find especially interesting, though,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5187)|
| 1:26:29| is that it's a two-edged sword being attractive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5189)|
| 1:26:33| in that occasionally you run into situations| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5193)|
| 1:26:37| where people may do things that are contrary| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5197)|
| 1:26:40| to the integrity of the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5200)|
| 1:26:41| that we've been working on for over 60 years| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5201)|
| 1:26:44| and built it into such a great neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5204)|
| 1:26:47| There's a really strong community spirit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5207)|
| 1:26:49| and that comes from people having shared values.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5209)|
| 1:26:53| And one of the key shared values in our community| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5213)|
| 1:26:56| is a single family residential home.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5216)|
| 1:26:59| And all we're asking is that it stay that way.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5219)|
| 1:27:02| And again, I think legally we have a strong argument| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5222)|
| 1:27:07| why a duplex should not be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5227)|
| 1:27:10| and a special use application should be denied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5230)|
| 1:27:14| because again, all the points that Matt and Dale| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5234)|
| 1:27:17| have brought out just reinforce and improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5237)|
| 1:27:21| the fact that the standards have not been met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5241)|
| 1:27:25| It should never have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5245)|
| 1:27:27| And so we are respectfully asking that you do deny| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5247)|
| 1:27:31| the special use application and that you vote in favor| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5251)|
| 1:27:34| of the West Hills Community Association| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5254)|
| 1:27:36| and our neighbors at Westridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5256)|
| 1:27:38| And one other thing, if I may, I'd like to ask before I go| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5258)|
| 1:27:42| is that I wanted to share, too, and maybe Dale mentioned it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5262)|
| 1:27:45| but I want to, again, reinforce the fact| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5265)|
| 1:27:49| that there's such a strong commitment in the neighborhood| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5269)|
| 1:27:52| that people spoke up, and Dale and others went around| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5272)|
| 1:27:56| and collected signatures of over 250 neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5276)|
| 1:27:59| along Westridge and in the immediate area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5279)|
| 1:28:02| that strongly opposed the idea of having a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5282)|
| 1:28:06| But let me also say in the same breath| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5286)|
| 1:28:09| that we welcome another single family home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5289)|
| 1:28:12| and there's no doubt in my mind| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5292)|
| 1:28:14| that it would be very attractive, it would be very sellable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5294)|
| 1:28:18| and I'm sure that a profit could be realized by the developer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5298)|
| 1:28:23| rather than it becoming a rental property as a duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5303)|
| 1:28:27| and I understand that maybe that's not his business model.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5307)|
| 1:28:30| Thank you. Mr. Hume, that concludes your five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5310)|
| 1:28:32| Thank you. Yes, ma'am.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5312)|
| 1:28:34| Thank you all very much. I appreciate it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5314)|
| 1:28:36| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5316)|
| 1:28:38| Council, we have three people signed up to speak in opposition.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5318)|
| 1:28:40| Item 10B, the first one is Taylor Forrester.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5320)|
| 1:28:42| Mr. Forrester?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5322)|
| 1:28:49| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5329)|
| 1:28:55| Taylor Forrester, 1111 North North Shore Drive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5335)|
| 1:28:58| Knoxville, Tennessee, 37919.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5338)|
| 1:29:01| Here on behalf of the property owner, Maple Lane Homes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5341)|
| 1:29:05| as been discussed by the previous speakers,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5345)|
| 1:29:08| this is a vacant parcel.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5348)|
| 1:29:10| A vacant parcel in West Hills is rare.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5350)|
| 1:29:15| When that became available, my client sought it out| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5355)|
| 1:29:18| because it is an attractive community.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5358)|
| 1:29:20| West Hills is a community that's, there's a lot of desire,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5360)|
| 1:29:23| there's a lot of families that live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5363)|
| 1:29:25| It's a good family neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5365)|
| 1:29:28| Property is zoned R and 1.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5368)|
| 1:29:30| The R and 1 zoning ordinance does contemplate two family dwelling units.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5370)|
| 1:29:35| With that contemplation, it's under a special use review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5375)|
| 1:29:39| The ordinance says if you satisfy the special use standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5379)|
| 1:29:42| then the special use request should be approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5382)|
| 1:29:47| In this case, staff analyzed the specific request| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5387)|
| 1:29:51| for a two family dwelling unit,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5391)|
| 1:29:53| applied the special use standards and found,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5393)|
| 1:29:56| and cited the different characteristics for each condition of the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5396)|
| 1:30:01| or each standard as to how it met it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5401)|
| 1:30:06| I guess the appellant's main challenge is that they contend| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5406)|
| 1:30:10| that it doesn't comply with the one year plan location criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5410)|
| 1:30:14| and therefore this should be overturned and done away with.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5414)|
| 1:30:21| I'm not going to speak for planning staff,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5421)|
| 1:30:24| but having handled several of these over the past 15 plus years,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5424)|
| 1:30:32| I know that when staff reviews these under the adopted plans and policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5432)|
| 1:30:38| it's a collective review.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5438)|
| 1:30:40| You have your general plan, you have your sector plans,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5440)|
| 1:30:42| you have your one year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5442)|
| 1:30:44| At times those plans don't always necessarily align,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5444)|
| 1:30:46| but it is a collective review by the planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5446)|
| 1:30:50| when they come to making these decisions.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5450)|
| 1:30:54| They cite the location criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5454)|
| 1:30:56| contemplating that duplexes should be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5456)|
| 1:30:59| where one or more certain enumerated conditions exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5459)|
| 1:31:03| When you apply the plain language of that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5463)|
| 1:31:05| that does not mean if you don't have one of those conditions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5465)|
| 1:31:07| that a duplex is not allowed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5467)|
| 1:31:10| It's that it should be considered on property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5470)|
| 1:31:13| where you do have these criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5473)|
| 1:31:15| Again, that's not a mandatory limitation or restrictive,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5475)|
| 1:31:19| but regardless, this property, the northern rear boundary of it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5479)|
| 1:31:25| meets one of the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5485)|
| 1:31:27| It is the one where you have a residential property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5487)|
| 1:31:30| that is joined or abuts a non-residential property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5490)|
| 1:31:34| and the non-residential property here is a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5494)|
| 1:31:37| That's an active church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5497)|
| 1:31:38| It has multiple buildings on the site, a large parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5498)|
| 1:31:42| therefore satisfying that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5502)|
| 1:31:45| The use for this property, the proposed developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5505)|
| 1:31:49| in harmony with the surrounding area, it's a large lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5509)|
| 1:31:53| The R and 1 zoning ordinance requires a minimum| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5513)|
| 1:31:55| of 10,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5515)|
| 1:31:57| This lot, for a single family, and this lot's just shy of 20.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5517)|
| 1:32:02| For a two-family dwelling, it's 15,000 square feet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5522)|
| 1:32:05| so it's almost close enough to being 20,000 square feet| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5525)|
| 1:32:09| where it could be subdivided into two separate lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5529)|
| 1:32:13| The two-family dwelling, the living area for each| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5533)|
| 1:32:17| is approximately 1,400 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5537)|
| 1:32:20| Combined, that's 2,800 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5540)|
| 1:32:23| For this area, a 2,800-square-foot house| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5543)|
| 1:32:25| would not be an uncommon house,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5545)|
| 1:32:27| therefore not out of character and in harmony with the area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5547)|
| 1:32:33| Since RECODE, with the adoption of the new ordinances,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5553)|
| 1:32:38| I did some research and had some research pulled| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5558)|
| 1:32:43| to figure out how many two-family dwelling| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5563)|
| 1:32:46| special use applications we've had throughout the city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5566)|
| 1:32:49| since the adoption, and there's been 15 requests to date.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5569)|
| 1:32:53| Of those 15 requests, 11 have been approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5573)|
| 1:32:57| One not yet heard, only one denied, and one appealed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5577)|
| 1:33:01| and that is this one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5581)|
| 1:33:03| After reviewing all of those staff reports,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5583)|
| 1:33:06| searching location through KGIS, those reports are all consistent.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5586)|
| 1:33:12| They apply all the same standards that the report applied here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5592)|
| 1:33:16| The analysis is comparable, albeit different facts| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5596)|
| 1:33:19| based on circumstances, and several of those properties| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5599)|
| 1:33:22| were in neighborhoods very similar to West Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5602)|
| 1:33:26| where you had comparable infrastructure.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5606)|
| 1:33:28| You had grid-like streets.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5608)|
| 1:33:31| It was very, very comparable,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5611)|
| 1:33:33| and hence why staff landed on the approval here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5613)|
| 1:33:38| And after discussion and debate and consideration| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5618)|
| 1:33:41| by Planning Commission, the unanimous approval.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5621)|
| 1:33:45| Again, we think this is a great opportunity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5625)|
| 1:33:47| close proximity to West Hills, public parks, greenways,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5627)|
| 1:33:51| and considering such, we ask that you deny the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5631)|
| 1:33:54| and uphold the Planning Commission's approval| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5634)|
| 1:33:57| of the special use request.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5637)|
| 1:33:58| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5638)|
| 1:33:59| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5639)|
| 1:34:00| Next person signed up to speak against Item 10B is Jay Piper.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5640)|
| 1:34:05| Mr. Piper, if you could approach the podium,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5645)|
| 1:34:08| state your name and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5648)|
| 1:34:11| and you have up to five minutes to address Council.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5651)|
| 1:34:15| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5655)|
| 1:34:16| I go by Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5656)|
| 1:34:17| I'm in Jack up there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5657)|
| 1:34:18| It confuses me a good portion of my life myself.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5658)|
| 1:34:22| Good evening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5662)|
| 1:34:23| 7100 Westland Drive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5663)|
| 1:34:26| I stand before you today to briefly introduce myself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5666)|
| 1:34:30| and tell a short story.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5670)|
| 1:34:32| My wife, Megan, is here with me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5672)|
| 1:34:34| She's right there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5674)|
| 1:34:35| We have three children.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5675)|
| 1:34:37| I'm a lifelong Knoxville resident.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5677)|
| 1:34:39| I was born in Fort Sanders Hospital| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5679)|
| 1:34:42| and attended Carnes Primary, Intermediate, Middle,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5682)|
| 1:34:46| and High all there at Carnes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5686)|
| 1:34:49| And it agreeably took me longer than it should have,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5689)|
| 1:34:53| but I did manage to graduate from the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5693)|
| 1:34:56| My dreams of being in real estate began in 2012| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5696)|
| 1:34:59| when my dad and I bought our first investment property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5699)|
| 1:35:02| In 2017, I went into full-time real estate.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5702)|
| 1:35:05| At that time, I was buying distressed properties,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5705)|
| 1:35:08| personally renovating them, and then selling them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5708)|
| 1:35:13| Many of those days had my time occupied| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5713)|
| 1:35:16| in crawl spaces and attics,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5716)|
| 1:35:18| and I'm thankful that those days have mostly subsided.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5718)|
| 1:35:22| My wife, Megan, got her real estate license to help me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5722)|
| 1:35:28| but her career quickly flourished,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5728)|
| 1:35:31| and I was then encouraged to go get my license| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5731)|
| 1:35:34| to then help her.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5734)|
| 1:35:36| Over time, our investment business has shifted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5736)|
| 1:35:38| to prefer rental property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5738)|
| 1:35:41| We see that it is a need in the community,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5741)|
| 1:35:44| and we have enjoyed the relationships| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5744)|
| 1:35:46| we have built in that space.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5746)|
| 1:35:48| Now for a brief story,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5748)|
| 1:35:50| I had three two-family dwellings constructed in Carnes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5750)|
| 1:35:54| that completed construction in early 2023.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5754)|
| 1:35:58| One of the tenants that moved into that small development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5758)|
| 1:36:01| was set to wrap up his college football career| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5761)|
| 1:36:03| that upcoming fall with the University of Tennessee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5763)|
| 1:36:07| He was a fifth-year senior, married, and had one child.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5767)|
| 1:36:11| Over the course of that approximate 15-month| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5771)|
| 1:36:14| tenant-landlord relationship,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5774)|
| 1:36:16| we had brief interactions| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5776)|
| 1:36:18| but established a relationship as friends also.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5778)|
| 1:36:22| They even welcomed a second child to that unit| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5782)|
| 1:36:25| while they stayed there over that 15 months.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5785)|
| 1:36:28| As their lease drew to an end,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5788)|
| 1:36:30| I worked with them as they waited to hear| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5790)|
| 1:36:32| where their next opportunity would lead,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5792)|
| 1:36:34| and I'm proud to say that that football player| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5794)|
| 1:36:36| accepted a position with the strength| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5796)|
| 1:36:38| and conditioning team at Baylor University,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5798)|
| 1:36:40| and that family left my rental property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5800)|
| 1:36:43| last weekend to head to Waco.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5803)|
| 1:36:46| So I went to the unit yesterday morning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5806)|
| 1:36:48| to simply see what I had to work on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5808)|
| 1:36:50| before the next tenant moves in,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5810)|
| 1:36:52| and I found this signed football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5812)|
| 1:36:56| This was a game ball issued on November 22, 2022,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5816)|
| 1:36:59| when Tennessee defeated Vanderbilt 56-0.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5819)|
| 1:37:03| It is then signed by the player,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5823)|
| 1:37:05| my now former tenant and a new friend,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5825)|
| 1:37:08| and it says GBO,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5828)|
| 1:37:10| which of course stands for Go Big Orange.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5830)|
| 1:37:12| It says, Thanks for everything, Jay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5832)|
| 1:37:16| I want to add that I didn't ask for this football.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5836)|
| 1:37:20| I was tempted to when I first found out he did play there,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5840)|
| 1:37:24| but it was their way of saying thank you| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5844)|
| 1:37:26| for being flexible and cordial| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5846)|
| 1:37:28| as they determined the next best step for their family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5848)|
| 1:37:32| I tell you this story today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5852)|
| 1:37:33| to hopefully paint a picture of why I believe| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5853)|
| 1:37:36| the building of a two-family dwelling on Westridge Drive| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5856)|
| 1:37:38| matters for Knoxville as a whole| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5858)|
| 1:37:41| and to provide one example| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5861)|
| 1:37:42| of a mutually beneficial relationship| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5862)|
| 1:37:44| for both the tenant and the landlord.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5864)|
| 1:37:48| I was fortunate to have that family live there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5868)|
| 1:37:54| Sorry.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5874)|
| 1:37:56| And for that time in their lives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5876)|
| 1:37:58| I believe it's where they needed to be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5878)|
| 1:38:01| I ask that you uphold County Commission's 11-0 vote| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5881)|
| 1:38:04| to allow the building of a two-family dwelling on Westridge.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5884)|
| 1:38:08| Thank you all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5888)|
| 1:38:10| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5890)|
| 1:38:11| The final person signed up to speak in opposition,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5891)|
| 1:38:14| item 10B, is Hanson Sale.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5894)|
| 1:38:17| If you could start by stating your name| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5897)|
| 1:38:18| and address for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5898)|
| 1:38:19| you have up to five minutes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5899)|
| 1:38:20| Hanson Sale, 205 East Oklahoma.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5900)|
| 1:38:22| Lovely to see all of you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5902)|
| 1:38:24| After a while, I'm here, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5904)|
| 1:38:25| for the first time speaking in my own personal capacity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5905)|
| 1:38:29| I want to just address first the special use process.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5909)|
| 1:38:32| What's happening here today is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5912)|
| 1:38:34| we've set standards for people to meet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5914)|
| 1:38:36| They met them in the opinion of planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5916)|
| 1:38:39| and the unanimous opinion of the Planning Commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5919)|
| 1:38:42| and now, through an appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5922)|
| 1:38:43| it's being subjected to what I would consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5923)|
| 1:38:46| a fairly arbitrary political vote.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5926)|
| 1:38:48| So I want to talk a little bit about the politics.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5928)|
| 1:38:51| First, our system of government was built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5931)|
| 1:38:55| our country was founded on the private property rights.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5935)|
| 1:38:59| If you have a piece of land, within reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5939)|
| 1:39:02| you can develop it to its highest and best use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5942)|
| 1:39:05| So unlike HOAs, which have their own prerogatives,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5945)|
| 1:39:08| government really needs a compelling interest| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5948)|
| 1:39:10| to prevent something from happening.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5950)|
| 1:39:13| And so I would ask you here today,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5953)|
| 1:39:15| what are we preventing by saying no to a duplex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5955)|
| 1:39:21| What's the harm of a duplex in a neighborhood in our city| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5961)|
| 1:39:26| at a time when housing is, as you all well know, scarce?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5966)|
| 1:39:31| So while the concerns of neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5971)|
| 1:39:33| are an important consideration,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5973)|
| 1:39:35| it's also important that we consider| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5975)|
| 1:39:37| the veracity of those concerns.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5977)|
| 1:39:40| Many of the public comments| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5980)|
| 1:39:41| and some of the comments here today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5981)|
| 1:39:43| have alluded to this notion that a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5983)|
| 1:39:46| will destroy or compromise the integrity of a neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5986)|
| 1:39:51| much less a neighborhood, in this case,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5991)|
| 1:39:54| that already has two separate lots with multiple units on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5994)|
| 1:39:58| It's simply an unfounded claim.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=5998)|
| 1:40:01| And we also have to ask the question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6001)|
| 1:40:03| why a single-family home with the same number of bedrooms| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6003)|
| 1:40:08| wouldn't compromise the integrity of the neighborhood,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6008)|
| 1:40:12| but a duplex with renters would.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6012)|
| 1:40:15| I think we have to grapple with that question| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6015)|
| 1:40:17| because it's clearly been implicated here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6017)|
| 1:40:20| But the more likely scenario of a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6020)|
| 1:40:22| is not that it will destroy the neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6022)|
| 1:40:25| The more likely scenario is this project will result| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6025)|
| 1:40:29| in this community having two more friendly neighbors| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6029)|
| 1:40:32| who also care about all of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6032)|
| 1:40:35| that make West Hills as desirable as it is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6035)|
| 1:40:39| I also want to address a concern that I've heard,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6039)|
| 1:40:42| that buying a home in a predominantly| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6042)|
| 1:40:44| single-family neighborhood gives you a right| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6044)|
| 1:40:48| not to have that neighborhood ever changed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6048)|
| 1:40:51| and to stay the same in perpetuity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6051)|
| 1:40:54| and that government, in many cases,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6054)|
| 1:40:56| it's suggested that government has an obligation| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6056)|
| 1:40:59| to ensure that a neighborhood stays the same.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6059)|
| 1:41:02| I don't think that holds true.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6062)|
| 1:41:04| In the same way that I bought a home in Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6064)|
| 1:41:06| and the property tax rate was at a certain level,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6066)|
| 1:41:10| I understood that a lot of people come to Knoxville| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6070)|
| 1:41:12| because we have low property taxes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6072)|
| 1:41:14| but I don't have a right for that not to change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6074)|
| 1:41:17| At some point in time, things will change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6077)|
| 1:41:19| circumstances will change,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6079)|
| 1:41:21| and we might need to raise our property taxes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6081)|
| 1:41:23| because we might need to pay for first responders.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6083)|
| 1:41:26| The same thing holds true with zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6086)|
| 1:41:29| There is no right for things to stay the same in perpetuity,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6089)|
| 1:41:33| and that's part of what the property rights| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6093)|
| 1:41:35| and private property rights regime| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6095)|
| 1:41:37| in our country is all about.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6097)|
| 1:41:40| I just want to say I think it's important| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6100)|
| 1:41:42| that you all recognize that we've set standards| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6102)|
| 1:41:45| for special use, the applicant has met those,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6105)|
| 1:41:48| that's the professional opinion of planning staff| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6108)|
| 1:41:51| and the unanimous opinion of planning commission,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6111)|
| 1:41:54| and if you support this appeal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6114)|
| 1:41:57| I would ask, we've been working on trying to improve| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6117)|
| 1:42:00| our development process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6120)|
| 1:42:02| but how are we improving our development process?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6122)|
| 1:42:05| If we ask applicants to meet standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6125)|
| 1:42:07| our professionals say that they met them and say,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6127)|
| 1:42:10| yeah, at the end of the day,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6130)|
| 1:42:12| we're going to subject it to the political process and say no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6132)|
| 1:42:15| I think that's a pretty bad way to do development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6135)|
| 1:42:18| so I would ask that you deny this appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6138)|
| 1:42:20| Thanks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6140)|
| 1:42:22| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6142)|
| 1:42:24| The appellee, West Hills Community Association,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6144)|
| 1:42:26| has the opportunity for a two-minute rebuttal,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6146)|
| 1:42:29| if you wish.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6149)|
| 1:42:38| Appellant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6158)|
| 1:42:43| Okay, sorry, appellant, not appellee.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6163)|
| 1:42:48| Mr. Hume, you have up to two minutes to offer a rebuttal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6168)|
| 1:42:52| to some of the other comments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6172)|
| 1:42:54| Thank you very much.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6174)|
| 1:42:56| Yes, I'd like to respond to some of the things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6176)|
| 1:42:59| that we've just heard.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6179)|
| 1:43:01| Number one, the last comments about property owners| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6181)|
| 1:43:07| not having a right to have protections,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6187)|
| 1:43:10| then that's totally contrary to why do you have zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6190)|
| 1:43:15| why do you have planning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6195)|
| 1:43:17| why do you have these situations that the designation set up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6197)|
| 1:43:25| if it isn't to protect investments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6205)|
| 1:43:29| This is called real estate for a reason.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6209)|
| 1:43:31| This is real property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6211)|
| 1:43:33| This is tangible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6213)|
| 1:43:35| It's not a commodity that should be done whimsically.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6215)|
| 1:43:39| It needs to be respected.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6219)|
| 1:43:41| This is, for most people that live in West Hills| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6221)|
| 1:43:44| and I'd say across the city,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6224)|
| 1:43:46| who own a home in a single-family residential area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6226)|
| 1:43:50| it is their largest single investment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6230)|
| 1:43:54| It's an opportunity as a homeowner to build wealth,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6234)|
| 1:43:58| and it's something I wish that everybody would have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6238)|
| 1:44:00| the opportunity to do.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6240)|
| 1:44:03| As far as not being able to protect our property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6243)|
| 1:44:08| we have a trust in our government,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6248)|
| 1:44:11| our local government, this body, to respect the law.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6251)|
| 1:44:17| And the current law says in an RN1 zone,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6257)|
| 1:44:21| it is designed to be single-family residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6261)|
| 1:44:25| It has nothing to do with being rental property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6265)|
| 1:44:28| or homeowner property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6268)|
| 1:44:31| It's single-family residential, not a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6271)|
| 1:44:36| And the reason why we're opposing it| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6276)|
| 1:44:39| is we're trying to protect the integrity of our neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6279)|
| 1:44:42| It is over 60 years old,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6282)|
| 1:44:44| built on the idea of it being a single-family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6284)|
| 1:44:47| residential neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6287)|
| 1:44:49| And that's the most fundamental reason| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6289)|
| 1:44:51| that we're appealing this decision.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6291)|
| 1:44:54| And we ask that you vote in our favor to uphold our appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6294)|
| 1:44:58| Thank you, Mr. Hume.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6298)|
| 1:45:00| Councilmembers, that concludes the speakers for this item.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6300)|
| 1:45:04| Any questions or discussion?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6304)|
| 1:45:06| Councilmember Roberto.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6306)|
| 1:45:07| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6307)|
| 1:45:09| First, I wanted to start off by thanking| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6309)|
| 1:45:12| both parties involved in this matter.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6312)|
| 1:45:18| There were multiple postponements,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6318)|
| 1:45:20| so I appreciate everyone's patience.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6320)|
| 1:45:22| I know that some of those were based on things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6322)|
| 1:45:25| that were going on with me, but then also with others as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6325)|
| 1:45:28| And I just appreciate everyone's patience| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6328)|
| 1:45:30| as we've been going through this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6330)|
| 1:45:34| I spent a lot of time looking through the packet,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6334)|
| 1:45:36| and I see what planning staff had provided| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6336)|
| 1:45:41| with the special use report.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6341)|
| 1:45:43| And I hear what the neighborhood is saying as well| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6343)|
| 1:45:48| and the arguments that are being presented.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6348)|
| 1:45:52| Certainly in Article 16.2 F2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6352)|
| 1:45:58| it was discussed at length by some of the speakers.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6358)|
| 1:46:02| And one of those items does say that the use is consistent| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6362)|
| 1:46:08| with the adopted plans and policies,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6368)|
| 1:46:10| including those in the general plan and the one-year plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6370)|
| 1:46:13| And so when you go and look at the one-year plan after that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6373)|
| 1:46:20| and council just recently passed the 2024 one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6380)|
| 1:46:27| and the items that were discussed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6387)|
| 1:46:30| by some of the neighborhood folks today| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6390)|
| 1:46:33| are located on page 29 and page 30| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6393)|
| 1:46:36| of the one-year plan we recently approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6396)|
| 1:46:41| Those requirements, as has been discussed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6401)|
| 1:46:45| were that duplexes should be allowed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6405)|
| 1:46:47| where one or more of the following conditions exist.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6407)|
| 1:46:50| The proposed site is on a collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6410)|
| 1:46:53| The development of the duplex would provide a desirable buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6413)|
| 1:46:57| between residential and non-residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6417)|
| 1:47:00| The site is in an area having a gross density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6420)|
| 1:47:03| exceeding five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6423)|
| 1:47:06| The site is in an area which has experienced| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6426)|
| 1:47:08| a significant loss in housing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6428)|
| 1:47:10| but is still desirable for residential use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6430)|
| 1:47:13| The site is a part of a planned residential development.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6433)|
| 1:47:16| Conversion of a detached house into a duplex should be permitted| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6436)|
| 1:47:20| where the structure meets the location and criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6440)|
| 1:47:23| listed above and does not require significant variances.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6443)|
| 1:47:26| Duplexes should be encouraged in areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6446)|
| 1:47:28| designated as appropriate for medium-density housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6448)|
| 1:47:31| Duplexes may be used in some instances as buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6451)|
| 1:47:34| between detached housing areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6454)|
| 1:47:36| and more intense non-residential uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6456)|
| 1:47:39| So, considering that council has just recently passed| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6459)|
| 1:47:45| the 2024 one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6465)|
| 1:47:48| and these are conditions that are still being applied,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6468)|
| 1:47:53| it gives me some concern that in the report| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6473)|
| 1:47:56| they aren't mentioned at all.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6476)|
| 1:48:03| There's another issue that I want to talk to Mr. Swanson about| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6483)|
| 1:48:06| and that is that it's my understanding| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6486)|
| 1:48:09| that there's work currently going on to clarify the code| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6489)|
| 1:48:13| that a duplex with an excessive number of units| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6493)|
| 1:48:16| would not be permissible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6496)|
| 1:48:19| Is that work going on currently, Mr. Swanson?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6499)|
| 1:48:23| That work is ongoing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6503)|
| 1:48:24| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6504)|
| 1:48:26| I also have a real challenge while that work is ongoing,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6506)|
| 1:48:30| having that ambiguity out there| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6510)|
| 1:48:33| and the combination of the requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6513)|
| 1:48:38| in the one-year plan as well as that ambiguity| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6518)|
| 1:48:41| give me real pause here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6521)|
| 1:48:44| And so, I'm going to make a motion to approve the appeal| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6524)|
| 1:48:48| based on those two items.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6528)|
| 1:48:50| Second.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6530)|
| 1:48:52| Okay, motion has been made to approve the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6532)|
| 1:48:56| It has been made and seconded.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6536)|
| 1:48:57| Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6537)|
| 1:49:00| Yeah.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6540)|
| 1:49:01| I have some questions, I guess, for Ms. Brooks.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6541)|
| 1:49:05| Ms. Brooks, I'm looking at the one-year plan on your website| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6545)|
| 1:49:09| that we just approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6549)|
| 1:49:13| For me, it's page 31 of the PDF,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6553)|
| 1:49:15| so the location criteria for specific uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6555)|
| 1:49:21| It's pretty much what Councilman Roberto just read.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6561)|
| 1:49:23| The following section outlines specific policies| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6563)|
| 1:49:26| for different types of...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6566)|
| 1:49:29| Maybe I'm on the wrong page because that's specific to...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6569)|
| 1:49:34| Am I on the correct page?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6574)|
| 1:49:36| Is 31 of the one-year plan?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6576)|
| 1:49:38| It's page 31 of the PDF or 29 in the actual document.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6578)|
| 1:49:42| Okay, so I am...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6582)|
| 1:49:43| It was a little confusing because it says civic| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6583)|
| 1:49:47| and institutional uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6587)|
| 1:49:50| Duplexes in very small, I guess, print there.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6590)|
| 1:49:53| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6593)|
| 1:49:54| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6594)|
| 1:49:55| That part's a little confusing because it talks about churches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6595)|
| 1:49:57| and cultural facilities and social services,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6597)|
| 1:50:00| but that's not what we're talking about,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6600)|
| 1:50:02| so I don't think I understand that heading.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6602)|
| 1:50:04| But duplexes may be permitted in low-density areas,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6604)|
| 1:50:09| which the land use classification table includes duplexes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6609)|
| 1:50:14| as low-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6614)|
| 1:50:15| That's correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6615)|
| 1:50:16| That's correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6616)|
| 1:50:17| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6617)|
| 1:50:18| Because that was one of the points that's been brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6618)|
| 1:50:21| by speakers is that a duplex is not low-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6621)|
| 1:50:25| It's not single-family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6625)|
| 1:50:27| It's two-family, but it is low-density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6627)|
| 1:50:30| Yes, it is a use that can be considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6630)|
| 1:50:32| And in RN-1, it is permitted on a 15,000-square-foot lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6632)|
| 1:50:37| and this is a 19,000-square-foot lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6637)|
| 1:50:40| Okay, so within areas designated for low-density residential use,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6640)|
| 1:50:47| duplexes should be allowed where one or more...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6647)|
| 1:50:50| so only one of the criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6650)|
| 1:50:53| So the proposed site is located on a collector street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6653)|
| 1:50:58| Is Westridge a collector street?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6658)|
| 1:51:01| No, it is not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6661)|
| 1:51:02| Okay, so it doesn't meet that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6662)|
| 1:51:04| Development of the duplex would provide a desirable buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6664)|
| 1:51:08| between residential and non-residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6668)|
| 1:51:11| So the abutting property is a church.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6671)|
| 1:51:14| Yes, so technically it is abutting a non-residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6674)|
| 1:51:17| So it meets that criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6677)|
| 1:51:20| The site is in an area having a gross density| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6680)|
| 1:51:23| exceeding five dwelling units per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6683)|
| 1:51:26| Can you help me with that one,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6686)|
| 1:51:28| because I don't quite understand how to calculate that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6688)|
| 1:51:30| and I believe you guys addressed that in the packet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6690)|
| 1:51:35| Yes, that is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6695)|
| 1:51:36| So the one-year plan does not specify dimensions of that area,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6696)|
| 1:51:40| and so we note that a quarter mile to the northwest,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6700)|
| 1:51:45| there is a substantial amount| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6705)|
| 1:51:46| of more intensive residential development| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6706)|
| 1:51:49| that exceeds the five dwellings per acre.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6709)|
| 1:51:51| But again, the one-year plan does not define| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6711)|
| 1:51:54| what that area should be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6714)|
| 1:51:57| So just like when I'm doing residential comparables,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6717)|
| 1:52:01| you're reaching a little beyond over a street into another area| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6721)|
| 1:52:05| to get the comparables for the units per dwelling acre?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6725)|
| 1:52:09| Is that a pretty good assessment?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6729)|
| 1:52:12| Yes, that is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6732)|
| 1:52:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6734)|
| 1:52:15| The site is in an area which has experienced a significant loss.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6735)|
| 1:52:18| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6738)|
| 1:52:19| And I really don't understand why that's in our criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6739)|
| 1:52:23| personally, myself, aside.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6743)|
| 1:52:26| The site is part of a planned residential.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6746)|
| 1:52:28| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6748)|
| 1:52:29| Conversion of a detached house.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6749)|
| 1:52:30| No.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6750)|
| 1:52:31| Duplexes should be encouraged in areas designated as appropriate| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6751)|
| 1:52:34| for medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6754)|
| 1:52:35| We're not talking about medium density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6755)|
| 1:52:39| May be used in some incidences as buffers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6759)|
| 1:52:42| between detached housing areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6762)|
| 1:52:44| and more intense non-residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6764)|
| 1:52:46| So it's next to a parking lot, a community building.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6766)|
| 1:52:51| I'm not entirely sure what the back building there of the church is.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6771)|
| 1:52:55| So basically the criteria for the approving of this special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6775)|
| 1:52:58| is because it meets criteria number two in this list,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6778)|
| 1:53:03| is that the development of the duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6783)|
| 1:53:05| will provide a desirable buffer| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6785)|
| 1:53:07| between residential and non-residential areas.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6787)|
| 1:53:10| So the criteria outlined in the one-year plan| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6790)|
| 1:53:12| is just one set of criteria that we look at| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6792)|
| 1:53:14| when we're evaluating special uses.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6794)|
| 1:53:16| So there are other plans that come into play.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6796)|
| 1:53:18| So there's a general plan, which sector plans are components of.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6798)|
| 1:53:22| And so as noted in the staff report,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6802)|
| 1:53:24| this proposed development does support policy 8.1| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6804)|
| 1:53:28| that encourages growth in existing urban areas| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6808)|
| 1:53:30| through infill housing opportunities.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6810)|
| 1:53:32| And we also look to the criteria that's outlined in the zoning code itself| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6812)|
| 1:53:36| to ensure that it meets all the principal use standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6816)|
| 1:53:39| and this project does meet those as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6819)|
| 1:53:42| So it can meet the setbacks, the lot size is big enough,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6822)|
| 1:53:46| it's 19,000 when the minimum is 15,000.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6826)|
| 1:53:50| Those are all criteria that you used in consideration for your recommendation.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6830)|
| 1:53:55| It is, as well as the criteria for two family dwellings and 9.3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6835)|
| 1:54:01| It meets all of those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6841)|
| 1:54:02| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6842)|
| 1:54:04| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6844)|
| 1:54:05| I think my time is about up,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6845)|
| 1:54:06| but I think it's most important that the land use classification table| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6846)|
| 1:54:09| as well as the zoning both allow a duplex as low density.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6849)|
| 1:54:15| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6855)|
| 1:54:18| Any other questions or comments?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6858)|
| 1:54:20| Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6860)|
| 1:54:23| I mean, I'm sorry, Fugett?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6863)|
| 1:54:25| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6865)|
| 1:54:26| Excuse me.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6866)|
| 1:54:27| Council Member Fugett.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6867)|
| 1:54:29| This is difficult, but it's a tough decision,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6869)|
| 1:54:33| but I will say, for the record,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6873)|
| 1:54:37| I don't think your backyard backing up to open space owned by a church| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6877)|
| 1:54:45| is intensive use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6885)|
| 1:54:48| So that, I mean, I understand that you can say it's a church,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6888)|
| 1:54:53| but you clearly look on this, there's a church, there's a parking lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6893)|
| 1:54:58| there's a pavilion that the church uses and green space back behind that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6898)|
| 1:55:04| So that's why I'm struggling with the fact that it meets one criteria.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6904)|
| 1:55:13| Am I missing something?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6913)|
| 1:55:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6916)|
| 1:55:17| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6917)|
| 1:55:20| Council Member Thomas?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6920)|
| 1:55:21| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6921)|
| 1:55:22| Without reiterating some of the points that have already been made| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6922)|
| 1:55:25| about the lack of application, I think,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6925)|
| 1:55:30| of these guidelines to this particular piece of zoning,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6930)|
| 1:55:34| I don't think the criteria is actually sufficiently being met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6934)|
| 1:55:38| and I think actually there's been quite a stretch here by the Planning Commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6938)|
| 1:55:43| to try to fit this in to something where they can hang their hat on| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6943)|
| 1:55:47| to get this rezoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6947)|
| 1:55:50| I also want to speak generally about the integrity of our zoning laws.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6950)|
| 1:55:54| We have zoning for a reason,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6954)|
| 1:55:57| and a lot of the reason why Knoxville is such a nice place for people| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6957)|
| 1:56:01| who want to come here is because of some of the zoning that we've done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6961)|
| 1:56:06| Now, it has been some flexible.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6966)|
| 1:56:08| It has been done in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6968)|
| 1:56:10| But this trend where developers can just buy up a piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6970)|
| 1:56:13| no matter how it's zoned, and then come and get it rezoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6973)|
| 1:56:18| is not, I think, the way to build community and neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6978)|
| 1:56:23| There's plenty of property that is already zoned R&2,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6983)|
| 1:56:27| some of them in my district and some of them in my neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6987)|
| 1:56:30| The developer can go and buy those pieces of property| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6990)|
| 1:56:34| and, as a matter of right, build on them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6994)|
| 1:56:38| So I have a problem undermining our zoning codes| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=6998)|
| 1:56:44| by developers going into places that have traditionally been zoned| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7004)|
| 1:56:48| in a particular way and then coming before us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7008)|
| 1:56:52| and using very questionable criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7012)|
| 1:56:57| to try to fit into the zoning code.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7017)|
| 1:57:00| So I can't support this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7020)|
| 1:57:03| Or I will support the appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7023)|
| 1:57:05| Council Member Parker and then Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7025)|
| 1:57:09| Thank you, Mayor.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7029)|
| 1:57:12| I had a question, but also a comment.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7032)|
| 1:57:17| I am heavily regretting my vote on Beeman Lake Street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7037)|
| 1:57:26| Because that was a property going from R&1 to R&5| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7046)|
| 1:57:34| and much less infrastructure around, much tinier road.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7054)|
| 1:57:44| My question is about what I've heard concerns,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7064)|
| 1:57:47| not necessarily tonight, but what I've heard| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7067)|
| 1:57:50| in regards to duplexes are the design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7070)|
| 1:57:57| And when we had the missing middle come before us,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7077)|
| 1:58:00| one of the selling points made was that this would give us| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7080)|
| 1:58:04| at least some design standards for that missing middle housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7084)|
| 1:58:10| Ms. Brooks, can you help me understand| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7090)|
| 1:58:12| what design standards we have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7092)|
| 1:58:14| for duplexes outside of that area?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7094)|
| 1:58:17| Certainly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7097)|
| 1:58:18| So in Article 9.3, Principal Use Standards,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7098)|
| 1:58:21| there are specific standards for two-family dwellings.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7101)|
| 1:58:25| And those include the front entry must be a dominant feature| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7105)|
| 1:58:29| on the front elevation, so it must face the street.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7109)|
| 1:58:35| Using features such as porches, raised steps, stoops, windows,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7115)|
| 1:58:40| entrances, porches, and other architectural features| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7120)|
| 1:58:42| are required on all street-facing facades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7122)|
| 1:58:45| There's a 15% minimum transparency, so windows.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7125)|
| 1:58:49| It applies to all street-facing facades.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7129)|
| 1:58:52| Front-loaded garages are limited to 60% of that front facade.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7132)|
| 1:58:56| They also have to be set back.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7136)|
| 1:58:59| So there's quite a few additional requirements| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7139)|
| 1:59:02| of a two-family dwelling unit versus a single-family dwelling.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7142)|
| 1:59:05| Is that helpful?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7145)|
| 1:59:06| Anything regarding the roof?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7146)|
| 1:59:09| There's nothing specific to the roof, no.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7149)|
| 1:59:12| Gotcha.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7152)|
| 1:59:14| And so if this were a single-family dwelling,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7154)|
| 1:59:18| would it be able to have a similar design| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7158)|
| 1:59:21| as what we see from this duplex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7161)|
| 1:59:23| Yes, single-family homes do not have...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7163)|
| 1:59:25| Any design standards.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7165)|
| 1:59:26| ...dimensional use standards like this,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7166)|
| 1:59:28| unless it's in a historic overlay or infill housing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7168)|
| 1:59:32| And that's where I really struggle with it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7172)|
| 1:59:34| is that when I drive by these new developments,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7174)|
| 1:59:38| I tell myself, if this was a single-family home,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7178)|
| 1:59:42| we would not be able to prevent this monstrosity from going up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7182)|
| 1:59:47| But because it is a duplex or a different type of development,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7187)|
| 1:59:51| we do have a little bit of wiggle room.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7191)|
| 1:59:56| So for that reason, I'd support the project moving forward,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7196)|
| 2:00:02| and I'm against an appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7202)|
| 2:00:07| But I am in favor...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7207)|
| 2:00:12| Man, I don't even...| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7212)|
| 2:00:16| And I'm in favor of us developing| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7216)|
| 2:00:19| and committing to a better process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7219)|
| 2:00:24| for addressing our housing crisis| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7224)|
| 2:00:26| and for addressing our zoning needs.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7226)|
| 2:00:30| You know, at the beginning of my term,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7230)|
| 2:00:32| everyone was saying,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7232)|
| 2:00:33| we're not going to do this spot changes and zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7233)|
| 2:00:38| We just went through recode.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7238)|
| 2:00:39| We're not going to do these one-off zoning changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7239)|
| 2:00:42| And now our agenda is full of them week after week.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7242)|
| 2:00:46| And my concern is that we haven't done| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7246)|
| 2:00:51| the comprehensive planning that's needed for these changes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7251)|
| 2:00:54| We haven't made the infrastructure commitments.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7254)|
| 2:00:57| When we do follow the one-year plan that we have in place| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7257)|
| 2:01:01| that we approve,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7261)|
| 2:01:04| when we follow our normal planning processes,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7264)|
| 2:01:07| those are supposed to align| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7267)|
| 2:01:09| with other investments that we're making| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7269)|
| 2:01:12| so that that growth makes sense for our city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7272)|
| 2:01:18| So these one-off changes are bothering me,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7278)|
| 2:01:22| but this is a special-use appeal.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7282)|
| 2:01:24| This isn't a one-off change.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7284)|
| 2:01:26| This is a project that is complying| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7286)|
| 2:01:30| with a special-use process that we've put into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7290)|
| 2:01:38| So if we want a different process,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7298)|
| 2:01:41| I feel like we should do a comprehensive process| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7301)|
| 2:01:45| to put one into place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7305)|
| 2:01:46| Currently, the process we have in place,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7306)|
| 2:01:48| I believe they have complied with for this duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7308)|
| 2:01:56| Vice Mayor Smith?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7316)|
| 2:01:57| I tend to agree with Councilwoman Parker.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7317)|
| 2:01:59| I just want to replay a couple of things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7319)|
| 2:02:01| Director Brooks, make sure I heard this right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7321)|
| 2:02:04| There are three basic things that planning staff considers| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7324)|
| 2:02:08| for whether a duplex is allowed in special use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7328)|
| 2:02:12| One is the use table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7332)|
| 2:02:13| Another is the zoning table.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7333)|
| 2:02:17| And then the one-year plan location criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7337)|
| 2:02:21| that the appellant listed.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7341)|
| 2:02:23| Are those the three things that I heard?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7343)|
| 2:02:25| And the general plan as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7345)|
| 2:02:26| And the general plan.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7346)|
| 2:02:27| And the staff's perspective was that at least three of those| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7347)|
| 2:02:33| sans the one-year location criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7353)|
| 2:02:36| that planning staff looks at all of those things| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7356)|
| 2:02:39| and doesn't have to meet every single item| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7359)|
| 2:02:42| within those four aspects.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7362)|
| 2:02:43| But those four aspects are what are considered.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7363)|
| 2:02:46| We do consider those.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7366)|
| 2:02:47| We consider those as recommendations.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7367)|
| 2:02:49| And planning staff and planning commission| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7369)|
| 2:02:51| found that this was consistent with all the adopted plans| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7371)|
| 2:02:54| and policies that we have in place.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7374)|
| 2:02:56| OK.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7376)|
| 2:02:57| Yeah, I think the overwhelming, I mean,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7377)|
| 2:02:59| considering all four of those aspects,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7379)|
| 2:03:01| overwhelming criteria are met by this applicant.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7381)|
| 2:03:07| I do agree with some of the objections raised| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7387)|
| 2:03:09| by the Neighborhood Association.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7389)|
| 2:03:13| And I do take very seriously the application,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7393)|
| 2:03:18| the over-application of special use| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7398)|
| 2:03:20| for duplexes within predominantly single family| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7400)|
| 2:03:24| neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7404)|
| 2:03:25| I think it's worth repeating that we don't have| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7405)|
| 2:03:27| any exclusively single family neighborhoods| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7407)|
| 2:03:29| in the city of Knoxville.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7409)|
| 2:03:30| And so sometimes when we think about certain neighborhoods,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7410)|
| 2:03:34| we think predominantly single family,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7414)|
| 2:03:36| but it's not exclusive.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7416)|
| 2:03:38| And I think particularly given that this is an empty lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7418)|
| 2:03:41| I remember a lot of the legitimate concerns| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7421)|
| 2:03:43| as part of the missing middle discussion| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7423)|
| 2:03:45| was about demolition and replacement.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7425)|
| 2:03:48| I think this is an opportunity where| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7428)|
| 2:03:50| an applicant has met the overwhelming criteria| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7430)|
| 2:03:53| for a duplex in a neighborhood that| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7433)|
| 2:03:55| is predominantly single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7435)|
| 2:03:57| But it's an empty lot where that is a good use for that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7437)|
| 2:04:01| whereas I wouldn't be so supportive if a property were| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7441)|
| 2:04:05| being demolished for this use.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7445)|
| 2:04:07| So for that reason, I'll probably support the,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7447)|
| 2:04:11| I'll be supporting the developer for this one| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7451)|
| 2:04:15| because I think it's a unique opportunity for a duplex| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7455)|
| 2:04:19| that I do think will fit the neighborhood and not detract,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7459)|
| 2:04:22| and it won't be demolishing any property.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7462)|
| 2:04:25| So those are my thoughts for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7465)|
| 2:04:27| It is not straightforward, but I think| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7467)|
| 2:04:30| the overwhelming weight of this is| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7470)|
| 2:04:32| on the side of a conscientious developer for this.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7472)|
| 2:04:37| Council Member Ryder?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7477)|
| 2:04:39| Yeah, Ms. Brooks, RN2 was brought up| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7479)|
| 2:04:42| as a possibility for places that duplexes could be built,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7482)|
| 2:04:47| but that is also special use review, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7487)|
| 2:04:50| It's not a use by right?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7490)|
| 2:04:51| That is correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7491)|
| 2:04:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7492)|
| 2:04:53| So what zoning do you need for a use by right of a duplex?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7493)|
| 2:04:57| RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7497)|
| 2:04:58| RN3.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7498)|
| 2:04:59| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7499)|
| 2:05:00| How many RN3 lots, ballpark percentage, are there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7500)|
| 2:05:03| I got it in my email from you in the past.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7503)|
| 2:05:05| It's pretty small.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7505)|
| 2:05:06| I'd have to draw that email back up.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7506)|
| 2:05:07| I don't remember.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7507)|
| 2:05:08| But come on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7508)|
| 2:05:09| It's less than, what, 10%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7509)|
| 2:05:10| It's not very many.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7510)|
| 2:05:11| It's less than 4%?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7511)|
| 2:05:13| I mean, some minuscule?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7513)|
| 2:05:14| Maybe 5%, I would guess.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7514)|
| 2:05:16| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7516)|
| 2:05:17| So other than the missing middle housing that got passed,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7517)|
| 2:05:21| there's very few places that anyone could build a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7521)|
| 2:05:24| I just wanted to correct that for the record| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7524)|
| 2:05:27| and make sure I understand that correctly.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7527)|
| 2:05:29| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7529)|
| 2:05:30| Because we don't use RN3 very well at all, correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7530)|
| 2:05:34| We do not get a lot of requests for RN3| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7534)|
| 2:05:36| and it wasn't applied widely across the city.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7536)|
| 2:05:38| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7538)|
| 2:05:39| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7539)|
| 2:05:40| But to reiterate what has been said multiple times| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7540)|
| 2:05:43| is you guys used the criteria for the general plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7543)|
| 2:05:50| the one-year plan, the lot size.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7550)|
| 2:05:54| Those are all part of the criteria that go into considering| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7554)|
| 2:05:57| whether this is eligible or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7557)|
| 2:05:59| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7559)|
| 2:06:00| The zoning code, the principal use standards for duplexes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7560)|
| 2:06:03| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7563)|
| 2:06:04| Across the street from this lot,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7564)|
| 2:06:07| I noticed there are several flagpole lots,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7567)|
| 2:06:09| so lots behind other lots where there's a driveway| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7569)|
| 2:06:12| that accesses other lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7572)|
| 2:06:17| Because this is a 19,000-square-foot piece of property,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7577)|
| 2:06:20| it could also become a flagpole lot, is that correct?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7580)|
| 2:06:26| Because it's 80-foot wide,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7586)|
| 2:06:28| so what's the minimum width is 75-foot wide.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7588)|
| 2:06:32| Are you asking if they –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7592)|
| 2:06:33| well, it's not large enough to subdivide into two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7593)|
| 2:06:36| Is that what you're thinking?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7596)|
| 2:06:37| Because you have to have 19,000 square feet.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7597)|
| 2:06:40| 20,000 square feet total, so 10,000 minimum for a single family.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7600)|
| 2:06:44| 10,000 minimum for a single lot.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7604)|
| 2:06:45| So it couldn't be subdivided into two lots.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7605)|
| 2:06:49| Correct.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7609)|
| 2:06:50| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7610)|
| 2:06:51| It's close, but not quite.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7611)|
| 2:06:52| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7612)|
| 2:06:53| And I just wanted to – okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7613)|
| 2:06:56| Councilwoman, if you get –| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7616)|
| 2:06:57| I know one of the things you asked about was intensity.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7617)|
| 2:07:00| I didn't say – I don't know if it was heard that I said| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7620)|
| 2:07:03| that the fields behind it weren't intense.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7623)|
| 2:07:06| It's just a buffer from non-residential,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7626)|
| 2:07:08| which is what the criteria said.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7628)|
| 2:07:10| So I just wanted that on the record.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7630)|
| 2:07:14| Okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7634)|
| 2:07:15| Councilmember Fugate and then Vice Mayor Smith.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7635)|
| 2:07:18| Thank you.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7638)|
| 2:07:19| I just have a question because I'm not a lawyer.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7639)|
| 2:07:22| There are a lot in here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7642)|
| 2:07:24| But I guess – and this is really not even about this zoning.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7644)|
| 2:07:29| This is for my total clarification.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7649)|
| 2:07:34| We have an ordinance that says it has to have these things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7654)|
| 2:07:39| and then we have other plans that I hear it's the spirit of these things.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7659)|
| 2:07:45| I'm just kind of confused, and I don't mean to sound ugly about it,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7665)|
| 2:07:51| but I am confused because, you know,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7671)|
| 2:07:54| when we've read out some of the stuff in a one-year plan,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7674)|
| 2:07:58| it says these criteria must be met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7678)|
| 2:08:03| Right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7683)|
| 2:08:04| And I'm getting a head shake that says, no, it doesn't say it must be.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7684)|
| 2:08:08| Shall be, should, whatever.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7688)|
| 2:08:11| I'm just saying if it doesn't have to be met, then we better change the word.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7691)|
| 2:08:18| Or if it does have to be met, then we better change the word| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7698)|
| 2:08:22| because that, I think, is causing some confusion.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7702)|
| 2:08:27| Am I the only one confused?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7707)|
| 2:08:32| Apparently so.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7712)|
| 2:08:36| Anybody, you're the lawyer that brought up and read the thing.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7716)|
| 2:08:39| I'll answer you if I get the mic.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7719)|
| 2:08:43| Because I know should and shall mean very different things,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7723)|
| 2:08:48| and I think that's some of the being tripped up on.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7728)|
| 2:08:52| And then also it was said during – I mean, we've gotten so many emails| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7732)|
| 2:08:57| and things about this that there's already a duplex on the street,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7737)|
| 2:09:02| and then I've been told, no, there's not one.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7742)|
| 2:09:05| Is there?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7745)|
| 2:09:09| Can someone from planning answer that for me?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7749)|
| 2:09:11| Director Brooks, can you speak to Councilmember Fugate's question?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7751)|
| 2:09:16| There was discussion about that at Planning Commission, that there was a duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7756)|
| 2:09:19| and then there was some – called into question whether or not it was a legal duplex,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7759)|
| 2:09:22| that it was created legally.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7762)|
| 2:09:24| And I have not verified whether or not it's been created legally or not.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7764)|
| 2:09:33| All right.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7773)|
| 2:09:34| I think Councilmember Thomas is next.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7774)|
| 2:09:37| Yes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7777)|
| 2:09:39| I can't answer your question, but I'll comment on it.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7779)|
| 2:09:42| But I continually see things come before this body that are in that area.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7782)|
| 2:09:47| And to my review, it looks like the criteria is not being met,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7787)|
| 2:09:53| or the majority of the criteria is not being met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7793)|
| 2:09:56| And it looks to me like the Planning Commission is making some really big stretches| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7796)|
| 2:10:02| to try to check boxes to get zoning approved.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7802)|
| 2:10:06| And either we have a code that we respect or we don't.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7806)|
| 2:10:15| And the public is getting very cynical about zoning| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7815)|
| 2:10:20| and how much respect is being shown to the actual requirements.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7820)|
| 2:10:26| And people buy into certain neighborhoods with the somewhat confidence| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7826)|
| 2:10:32| that this is zoned a particular way, this is kind of the way I want to live.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7832)|
| 2:10:37| If I want to live another way, there's another zoning over here.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7837)|
| 2:10:41| And this, I think, is a good example of that.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7841)|
| 2:10:45| This is really, I think, unfair, because if you look at the criteria,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7845)|
| 2:10:50| most or not all, and I disagree with my colleagues, I don't think they're being met.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7850)|
| 2:10:56| And, again, developers have options on where to buy property and where to build.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7856)|
| 2:11:03| And in my district, it's zoned RN2.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7863)|
| 2:11:08| Ms. Brooks, are you telling me you can't build duplexes in RN2?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7868)|
| 2:11:12| Is that what I heard you say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7872)|
| 2:11:14| No, you can request to build them.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7874)|
| 2:11:16| It's a special use process as well.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7876)|
| 2:11:18| Right, okay.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7878)|
| 2:11:19| But it would be more compatible to go into an RN2 than an RN1 and build a duplex.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7879)|
| 2:11:27| Is that fair to say?| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7887)|
| 2:11:29| I would say we look at each special use separately.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7889)|
| 2:11:32| It's very site-specific, the special use processes.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7892)|
| 2:11:35| Well, I just think that what we're doing today is we're really undermining the respect| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7895)|
| 2:11:41| that communities should have as far as the ways zoning laws are applied.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7901)|
| 2:11:48| And we'll talk about design.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7908)|
| 2:11:51| Now, to my eye, this design on 99 of this duplex does not, to use the code,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7911)|
| 2:12:01| is not in harmony with that neighborhood.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7921)|
| 2:12:04| Now, maybe somebody else has got a different view, but if I saw this| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7924)|
| 2:12:09| and I was driving down the street in a neighborhood and I saw that,| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7929)|
| 2:12:13| it would stick out like, you know, a sore thumb maybe.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7933)|
| 2:12:17| Maybe in another neighborhood it might fit.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7937)|
| 2:12:20| But I just think that we're playing too fast and loose with zoning changes in neighborhoods.| [source video](https://archive.org/details/city-council-r-265-240514?start=7940)|
